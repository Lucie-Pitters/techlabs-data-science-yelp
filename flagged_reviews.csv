When I made the appointment, I mentioned to Jackie that my dog was neutered about 3-4 weeks before his appointment would be and it had been a while since I was able to brush him because of his tender area and so I wanted to have a professional do it. Good lord I took $200 in cash to pay for my dog and my other little dog that had to have some work done too. The total was $120 and she said I can give you change if you want me too? I'm all for tipping but to be ""given a talkin to about why I brought my dog in to begin with and to beg for a tip left little to be desired to go back. Plus there was some guy in there without a mask and no one did anything about it. Total time at that place for my dogs was 6 1/2 hrs. Wish I could give more stars as I heard this was a good place. My Dogs look no different than if I'd done them myself. And I know how hard that line of work is because I typically groom my dogs myself. A low maintenance dog is best for here. I mean no offense as this was my experience. There was one nice groomer there that gave me a little smile as I feel she knew what I was thinking. Kudos to her!",2021-01-17 06:42:06,303,1298,

This is my first time doing a yelp review ever, that has to mean something. So on January 18th I called and made a reservation for January 23rd to go to this place for my sisters birthday dinner. I made the reservation for 6:30pm and repeated it many times and made sure the woman on the phone heard me correctly. So the 23rd arrives and my family and I go in at our reservation time. I go and tell the lady that we're here and our reservation is for 6:30pm. She looks at the sheets she has printed of all the reservations and tells me she doesn't see my name. I ask her to please double check because I indeed made the reservation on the 18th. I even went ahead and pulled up my call log of the date and time I called and showed her that it was THEIR restaurant because she suggests maybe that I had made a reservation at the wrong restaurant. She saw that it was her restaurant. She completely ignores me and goes to sit another family. She comes back to me and tells ""yeah i'm sorry I don't see your name"". Imagine making a reservation 5 days early and not being able to have a birthday dinner for your sister because whoever I talked to to make the reservation I guess didn't write my name down or put me in anywhere. The rage that filled my body was unreal. I asked her if she's really not going to let us dine here because one of THEIR employees messed up. She just kept repeating herself and saying that we can't dine there. I ask to speak to the manager and she tells me she is the manager. As a manager I really believe she could've did SOMETHING to accommodate us in ANY way. She simply didn't care and kept saying we couldn't eat there. This was the most horrible experience I've ever had at a restaurant. I walked out in anger and will never be going there ever. If you guys wanna go there make sure you go in person to make a reservation and physically see them put your name down lmao.",2021-01-24 00:33:26,417,1947,

Some of those stores are restaurants, bars, & businesses that sell food items; they include the following (in alphabetical order):

900 Degrees Wood Fired Pizza, Barnes & Noble Cafe, The Brass Tap, 365 Cafe Italiano (Gelato), Cantina Laredo, Charleys Philly Steaks, Chuck Lager, Fresh Healthy Cafe, Grillsmith, Irish 31 Pub House & Eatery, le macaron French Pastries, menchie's frozen yogurt, Moe's Southwest Grill, Noble Crust, NOTHINGbundtCAKES, Panera Bread, Pholicious, Pinchers, The Pretzel Twister, Red Robin, Rocket Fizz (candy), Snowie, Teriyaki Madness, Vom Fass, & Yamato. 

I thankfully heard NO MUZAK today while roaming the streets of Wiregrass. There are; however, 3 public restrooms, 2 ATMs, & 2 Taxi areas. There's also a stand-alone Guest Services building where you can walk in to inquire; currently, just two visitors may enter @ a time. (I couldn't locate a particular store; the friendly staffer searched the computer, only to learn that the store permanently closed during the Covid shutdown.)

The first & third Saturday of each month (from 10 AM till 2 PM) is the outdoor market. Often close to 50 vendors set up tents to peddle their wares--  arts, crafts, photography, fruits & veggies, meats & cheese, fish, egg, candles, clothing, jewelry, lobster stew & rolls, fresh flowers, dog treats, plants, fresh juices, crawfish pies, & many other homemade creations. Cash is appreciated, but most vendors accept debit & credit. If you don't bring your own bags, plastic bags will be provided w/ your purchase. On market days, there's usually outdoor entertainment-- different solo acts (i.e. singers/guitarists) will preform on stage. 

In December, the mall is beautifully decorated & lit w/ many thousands of Christmas lights. The displays attract large crowds. And throughout the year, Wiregrass offers free music on Friday & Saturday nights. If you visit the Wiregrass website, you'll find a very convenient monthly calendar of events. (The weekend music is not offered all twelve months, so do check the calendar before heading over.)

One of my favorite aspects of this mall (other than the outdoor market) is the LARGE Barnes & Noble bookstore. It's a very nice two-level store. If you are looking for a particular book & it's not here, it can be ordered & received quickly. Be sure to check out the website to learn of the dates & times for Toddler Storytime (every Tuesday, I believe) & all the Virtual Talks w/ authors.  

Wiregrass offers lots of parking that includes parallel parking in front of the stores. (Those w/ Handicapped placards may park for free.) On weekend nights, the perimeter of the mall gets crowded w/ automobile traffic, especially near Noble Crust, Chuck Lager, & Pinchers, so avoid that area if possible. 

This mall is definitely a nice addition to Wesley Chapel. With at least four entryways into the mall, it's an easy outdoor mall to visit-- & close to I-75. I recommend checking it out if you're in the area.",2021-01-03 02:26:31,644,3101,

Ordered the day before for an important event, well in advance. Waited all day for delivery. Nothing came. Received an email telling me that a ""delivery attempt failed,"" even though no one ever attempted to come to my door, call, or text, and I was never given a time when the arrangement would arrive. Just ""delivery failed."" I guess I was supposed to be waiting outside all day for when the delivery came by? Then they could toss it out the car window at me? I have no idea.

In the email, I was told they would return. Well ... they didn't. Hours and hours passed. I decided to contact the store. Upon contacting the store, I was simply given a menu of pre-recorded options--all of which basically amounted to ""go to the website."" (There was no way to reach an actual person.) Went to the website, filled out a form, and never got an answer. Filled out another form, finally got an answer. Was told that a delivery attempt had failed (again, without a knock on the door or a phone call, yes, the delivery is going to fail--I cannot stand outside all day when you don't give me a time to do so). I was told another delivery attempt would be made, but it wasn't. 

In the meantime, I decided to drive to the store to pick up my arrangement. Although the hours on the website, on the phone recording, and ON THE DOOR ITSELF are listed as open until 7 p.m, this place was closed before 6. (I'm not sure anybody even works there at all.) 

I couldn't even physically go to the store to get the thing I was supposed to have delivered. It's nowhere. It has not come. And I am out $50.

I've used Edible Arrangements in other places, so I don't think it's the larger company but the Roxborough location. I was able to get a delivery from the Aramingo location, and they had no problem knocking on my door or calling me on the phone and telling me when they were going to deliver. You know, like with a NORMAL DELIVERY of a pre-purchased product. Nor did I have a problem calling them on the phone and reaching an actual person.

- I booked for 3 nights with an American Express, but there were no amenities the hotel could offer. Never book with them directly, book with a Travel agent or online reseller as you will get more  value. 
- Front desk utterly rude. I am used to Loews Boston being the best you can find, but here in Philadelphia seems unlikely they received the same training. They were neither knowledgeable nor helpful. 
- You can usually get information of how to contact them via text, this time none of that was given. When I tried to contact them using the text message service number I found on their website, the reply came 3 hours later. Just horrible.
- Late check out was not possible in any shape or form. Usually during covid times you get up to 3 or 4 pm, or you get the option to pay an extension. I explained to them my experience in other hotels of this same brand, and my willingness to pay but still their blank expression told me they could care less.
- The hotel was dirty. i understand it was understaff due to the times we are living, but still, it makes no excuse if you still charge the same prices for your stay. There was literally bags of trash on the halls. 
- Security was weak. At least twice there were homeless with visibly mental health issues screaming on the lobby.
- Bar service was so bad. I was looking forward to relax at the bar, understanding it had limited hours, but the bartender was on his phone and the service took ages. The chacuterie I bought (because to drink you have to buy food) it was stale and just so poorly presented.
It was depressing, to be honest. It was a celebratory weekend in a city that I was visiting for the first time and this was just the worst. 
A poor representation of what the Loews brand inspires in many other parts of the country and the world.",2021-01-19 14:45:53,401,1963,

I normally use Booking or expedia to reserve rooms, but being that we are in a pandemic, and this is my family's first time out I used Peppermill's official site.  After reading countless reviews, we decided to go with the Tuscany Tower Suite rooms.  My 7 year old was exteemely excited to have a jacuzzi bathtub to use during our stay, as we did not want to use the pool.  Again, this was our family's first time out since the pandemic, so we based our expectations of what we were paying for and hoping to receive on what the official Peppermill website advertised for our room specifically.  Spoiler alert: I've had better experiences with third party websites. 

 Pro: The room came with the 2 King beds we wanted. Surprised to find a small patio.

Cons: 
1. We checked in on our phone, got the text that our room was ready, and to check in at a kiosk. We go in and KIOSK weren't working, we still had to check in at the front desk. :( Female (Jenna, Jen...not sure) was not welcoming, she sounded like she didn't want to assist us with checking into our room. 
2. Bathroom did not match the description on the site at all. NO jacuzzi bathtub, NO  enclosed shower or private toilet area, and NO his/her sinks. 
  Imagine our shock when we saw this!!! 
3. POOR customer service!!! After seeing that we were missing many of the amenities we were looking forward to, I immediately called front desk. The male who took the call did not give his name, but told us there were NO rooms in the whole hotel with the jacuzzi bathtub available. Then he says they do have a smoking room available. 
4.  I turn it down! I tell him that it is false advertisement, because on the site under the room we booked, we saw the floor plan and the features listed, and those were the main reasons for booking at Peppermill and not at Atlantis or GSR, are not in the room they gave us. He says there is nothing he can do about that. 
  We spent over $200 for a ""Suite"" but given a regular room and told there is nothing they can do about it. NEVER RETURNING!",2021-01-31 03:54:44,464,2159,

The truffle pasta was what lured me in...love truffle pasta. I made a reservation for a Sunday night. We had to eat outside with a tent like covering since Philly was still under dining restrictions. I'm glad I wore my long underwear. They had some heaters attached to the roof  above but you don't really feel it unless you're sitting directly under it. I thought they would have heaters right next to the table. 

My husband had to get the meatballs as the appetizer. They were pretty good, maybe could have used a little more garlic, but decent. I liked that they put a big scoop of ricotta cheese on the side. They gave us bread but no butter. I asked for some but they didn't have any but gave us olive oil. 

We split 3 pastas. 

MURPHS PASTA-  very tasty and different. I was worried it was going to be too spicy but it was very well balanced. I loved the bacon in it gave it great flavor. There was a huge amount of cheese on it, it was a spicy cacioricotta. 

PEAR and CHEESE FIOCCHI- this was probably my favorite pasta. It was sweet and creamy and had honey on it. It tasted kind of like pumpkin or sweet potato pasta that I had before. This is probably best as an appetizer though or splitting it with someone because after awhile it's like a sweetness overload. 

TRUFFLE PASTA- They were pretty generous with the amount of black truffles, I was surprised. It tasted like they probably put some truffle oil in the sauce as well as it had a very strong truffle taste which I liked. However the cream sauce was a bit bland and this pasta was just ok. The sauce definitely could have used more salt or flavor but I still enjoyed it. 

Service wasn't too great though. They don't really come to check on you, just bring your food and the basics. We were both gonna get another drink but our waiter never came back around to ask so we didn't. 

Overall this is a great place to get some homemade pasta in Philly at a great price and big portions. Probably the best value in Philly. Yes there are better Italian restaurants in Philly- but this is probably the best pasta I have had at this price point. Would like to come back if they have some new seasonal pastas later.",2021-01-20 19:08:59,470,2251,

Got seated upstairs where some oriental girl told me we can't order for 15 minutes after we sit down. Huh? That's a rule is it? Not a good impression right off the bat. Instead of ""hi how are you welcome in"" - we get you can't order for 15 min it's a rule. Sigh... 

The bar upstairs wasn't open, they used it to pile up dirty glasses. We had an appetizer called Oyster Bar Trash wasn't the best. Very basic nothing special. 

Wedge salad - eh... 

Ordered happy hour martinis. Half the price = half the drink (pic included). Wasn't happy about that. 
Not sure if the girl spilled them going up the stairs or the bartender made them missing half the drink - but either way - the waitress should not give someone HALF a drink & think that's ok? Still a $6 drink at half price 

Red fish my husband had was ok (except for the very very very mushy green beans that came with it) 

I had crab legs - those were seasoned well and ok

Waitress was nice. Can't say that about the guy that greeted us or the girl who said we have to wait to order. 

Probably wouldn't come back, nothing about it was special for $129 + tip.

Very unorganized and overall not too friendly or welcoming. Probably would label the TGI Friday's of seafood. Can spend money elsewhere for better food. Wish I would have read the reviews first. Staff needs more training on how to be personable to people spending money on their establishment.

There are 17 ""Masterpiece Sushi Rolls"" available. Our Sunset Roll @ $12.95 w/ real crab, Ahi tuna, cucumber, avocado, & cilantro (etc.) was EXCELLENT.

The team at Si Charro makes you feel at home, and they are all so gracious. I definitely appreciate it when the manager or Chef comes by and ensures that you have a good experience. 

My favorite dishes here are the Lobster Tamalada, Surf & turf Enchiladas Banderas, and The Filet for steaks. Just about anything that you order will be a splendid experience for your palate. They also provide some incredible take-home meals for the holidays that are divine and easy to prepare.

The atmosphere and food is so fantastic that we hosted (pre-covid) our entire wedding party for our rehearsal dinner the night before our wedding. They definitely made that night a memorable one. One that I am forever grateful for. Their hospitality and service. Top-notch! 

You won't be disappointed if you're on the hunt for a steakhouse or looking to catch some tasty seafood.

I had some fillings done here this past week, and I was very impressed with the service I received, the short amount of time I spent in the chair, and the quality of what was done. 

My dentist, the male Dr. Kelly, applied an expert block prior to my procedure, and was expedient with his thorough work. I get extremely nervous during dental work, and I informed the dental assistant that I'd likely require additional anesthetic due to my tolerance of those. Before I left, Dr. Kelly adjusted my bite perfectly. Neither too high, nor too low. Somebody knows what they're doing!

They're fairly quiet at this place, but they definitely listen to you.

And now, a few words about the only negative review this practice has ever received since it opened:

If you walk into a medical facility during a pandemic with no appointment and expect not to feel like an inconvenience to them, then you're probably braindead.

Also, payment at most dentists are due when services are rendered, so it should come as no surprise that they wanted payment for your previous appointment before they saw you for the next one. Do you like being paid for your work? So do dentists. Shocking, right?!

Further, it sounds like your specific situation required work that needed to be performed by a specialist. This is a general dentistry. They're not endodontists. They referred you because they wanted you to receive the best care.

Confirming a previously scheduled appointment is standard procedure for most professionals, and doctors are no exception. If you can't reply to a simple email, text, or phone call, then you're probably also a non-compliant patient, and the definition of the absolute, perfect nightmare of a patient for any doctor.",2021-01-16 04:11:17,373,1901,

I chose to stay here as others have alluded as it is in the Marriott network and I needed just a few more nights to reach the next tier. First it is a pretty good deal. I had spent around $100 a night. I would say this is worth the money compared to other hotels. The Inn is very large and that is a plus as I felt like there was plenty of space and didn't run into other guests much. The Inn is older but my room looked like it had been completely renovated. There were no issues with paint and the bathroom, while rather small by modern standards was functional and clean. The only drawback with the rooms are and it would be a huge drawback, if you have four people in you family like I do, then you will have to share a twin bed as they dont have double Queen beds. However, the rooms are of decent size. The property does have free parking which is a plus versus the Gaylord Opryland across the street. They also have free coffee and its very good. There is a bus that will take you to the Gaylord across the street and to the mall as well as downtown. With the virus going on I cant comment on maid service but if you needed more towels or anything else they will just drop it off in your room.  The pool is great it is very large and right in the Atrium. It is one of the better pools in this class of hotel. My kids really enjoyed it and I had a room on the second floor overlooking the atrium so it was very convenient to the pool.

Their beers are as near to perfect as any brewery I've ever been to. And that's not just my opinion. Perennial receives award after award at a national level for their brews. They are always noted in high regard amongst the craft beer gurus. 

Let's just start this review out with the heaviest hitter. The creme de la creme. Abraxas. It's only available once a year. Most years you have to get on a pre-order list that is limited to four bottles per person. Is it a bit pricey? Yes. Is it worth every penny. FOR SURE. Abraxas is an imperial stout brewed with ancho chili peppers, cacao nibs, vanilla beans, and cinnamon sticks. Perennial always has a few variants of it including coffee and vanilla. They're all equally as good. This finely aged beer packs a punch at 11.5% but lacks that boozie taste. There is no beer at this high of an ABV that's as smooth as Abraxas. Each year I get so excited for the release and jump at a few extra pours on draught when I pick up my four bottles. This year was no different! 

We braved the cold to share a few glasses of Abraxas on the patio of Perennials South City brewery. There were a few fire pits and outdoor heaters strewn about to help fight off the cold, but due to social distancing we tried to stay further away from them. So pro tip, if you're going to sit outside at Perennial bring some blankets because their picnic tables can get cold! 

If you're hungry, you can ingest some Abraxas in the form of a slow roasted chili while you're sitting on the patio. It's the perfect way to celebrate the season and to attempt to keep as warm as possible.

Overall, I know that Perennial can sometimes be misconstrued as a snobby hipster brewery. But with beer as good as they're producing. I'll accept just about anything.",2021-01-12 22:42:32,390,1848,

Very bad business practices, will not purchase another battery from the West Coast battery. Bought a battery for my car 17 WRX about 2 months ago. Went out one morning to start the car there was not enough power to start car (slow crank then clicking). During inspection found my positive battery terminal was very corroded. Previous to the new battery installed there was no corrosion, also terminal had been cleaned before a new battery was installed.  Remove the battery and brought it to West Coast batteries. explained that the battery was no good. They proceeded to tell me there was a drawl in my car. They refused replacement of the battery. Actual concern was positive terminal on the battery was leaking causing corrosion on my battery terminal and due to corrosion there was a drawl on the battery. During our conversation I was treated with disrespect as if I had no knowledge of a 12V system which infuriated me and cause me to act out as well. I was told: ""If I was to get a new battery it would be dead in less than four days"". I've had a new battery in my car for two weeks with no issues.

I bought a 2nd battery, this battery was a  AGM deep cycle battery for my trolling motor.  But this battery and September 2020. Had the battery for approximately five months. Decided to go fishing over the weekend to my surprise the battery was completely dead after I had charged it and keep a solar maintainer on it. The trolling motor has a deck plug which remains unplug when not in use. Nothing else runs to this battery. Tried recharging the battery with two different chargers. Battery would not take a charge. Took the battery back to West Coast batteries.
They explained to me that the battery had been severely discharged. He said it had less than 1v  in the battery. Then they proceeded to tell me that they can put it on their charger over the weekend and see if it charges.  A battery was offered for the weekend but was stated my battery would most likely not charge.  I asked what would happen if the battery does not come back will they replace it? I was told due to the severe discharge it would automatically void the warranty so within five months I would have to replace two batteries that I received from the same place. It was stated to me by the owner, ""due to the concave walls on the battery you could tell the battery was severely discharged"". That is incorrect, this battery sits in a boat in the heat and cold and the vent system malfunctioned and caused a wall become concave. It does not affect the operation of the battery nor is it a sign of a battery being severely discharged.  I took the battery Because I needed a core since I had to buy a new battery. As i was picking up the owner/employee said that it charged to 7%. When I went home and put it on my AGM charger it had 0% charge. I am out over $300 in batteries and a course of four months. I know that there's a lot of good reviews  with this place but I'm simply telling you my experience. They have lost me as a customer due to the terrible experience and customer service.

So why do I dread coming here?  A few reasons.  The incredibly rude chicks that run the front desk.  It's like they all take a course in rudeness.  You don't even have to SAY anything and the questions you get reek of superiority in their tone.  

If you can get past them, then you have to deal with the lack of respect for your time and, in turn, your insurance company's.  It would be easy to find out what he charges for being late without an apology, taking one's pulse, using the ad nauseum stethoscope and his repetitive lectures but I don't care enough to look.  There are no clocks in the patient rooms but in this day and age of cell phones, there doesn't need to be, I suppose.  He has a lady with him typing on a computer while he yacks.  Don't expect to be introduced.  No, I don't mind discussing my health in front of some chick I don't know.   He glances at her quite a bit like he is looking for shit to talk about.. like he is just filling in time.   I work two jobs and honestly, I don't have time for the foolishness.  Do you think this couple cares that they are an hour late to see me and just maybe... just maybe I had things I HAD to do?  That would be a no. 

Oh, yeah... I understand why a license and insurance card is needed.  What I don't get is why I'm asked if there have been any changes to my insurance, address, etc.  I say no and THEN I'm asked to cough it up.  Run that by me again? Too many people are out of work for this type of personality to work a front desk anywhere in the continental U.S.  And why are these people too lazy to update the time on their TV?  For the same reason they don't have clocks in patients' rooms.  Takes work to change an AA battery.  If I can't wear a cloth mask in the office, maybe somebody should have stated that in advance. You think I'm going to run out to my car to get one?  Nope, I'll take yours.  And what's with the visitors?  Who would visit a doctor's office anyway?  I can think of plenty of places I'd rather visit than here.  Can't you?  The pier is open again... visit there.  Mick Jagger just bought a house in Lakewood Ranch.  Go visit him.  Heck, go out to Fort De Soto Park or take a hike up the 37-mile (!) Pinellas Trail.  My point, and I do have one, is that there are plenty of different ways to spend your time vs. visiting here.  Unless, of course, you enjoy watching people get treated like crap, spoken to like morons and have their pulse taken a few times while waiting uncomfortably for the good doc to start talking about the same stuff he talked about last month and you silently wonder why a. he never changes it up and/or b. does he live to hear his own voice?

When I got there, I was greeted by the cashier who told me to have a seat wherever I'd like. I ordered the fish & grits as well as the crab ball appetizer. 
While I was waiting on my food, one of the cooks asked if I wanted some corn on the cob on the house....of course I said yes. He brought out the corn and it was delicious. I couldn't wait for my food to come!

Next, my crab balls came out. They were FULL of crab meat and served with a dipping sauce. I loved the fact that they had a lot of crab meat, but not a lot of flavor. They were just okay to me.

After trying the appetizer, I moved over to the fish & grits. The fish was really good and light, but the grits was a different story. The grits were cold and the gravy on top was flavorless. It also had pieces of wilted spinach with the stems that should have been cut into smaller pieces. The texture of the spinach ended up throwing the dish off. The portion was that big either, so I think $20 was too much for the meal. I would have asked them to re-heat the food, but I didn't have time. 

The staff was friendly and talkative, which made me feel at home. I had high expectations, but was a little disappointed in my entree. I'd love to try something different, but I'm not in a hurry to go back.",2021-01-07 01:56:53,311,1345,

Street parking is available on 22nd Street or Delaware. As you enter the restaurant you'll see the carryout window. Turn left and go thru the door and you'll be directly in front of the hostess stand. The large, full bar is attractive and to the right as you enter. 

Seating consists of large booths,  banquette seating, bar and weather permitting, patio seating. Large groups could be seated on the banquette seating if all available.

The menu has a wonderful selection from the complimentary chips and salsa to jalapeno poppers, ten buffalo chicken wings to nachos with steak, chicken and shrimp loaded with toppings. If you prefer fries to chips try the Crazy Nachos with beef or chicken. The Guacamole Fresco is so fresh and filled with flavor. If you like Guacamole try this generous appetizer. 

The menu offers a lunch menu as well as the entrees we all love. Several versions of salads, quesadillas, burritos, enchiladas, chimichangas or 3 tacos with rice and charro beans cover many of the entrees. Fajitas and Loco's specialities round out the menu. The Chili Colorado is one of my husband's favorites. A Tilapia filet, Fajita Fish, Seafood Enchiladas or Cameron's de la Diabla is available for those looking for seafood. The Tio's Combo is popular with a chicken burrito, enchilada and chimichanga all smothered in chili con queso. The Seafood Enchiladas or the Enchiladas Ranchero are two of my favorites.

This is a long one bc I want to explain all the history that impacted my opinion Of this place. So bear with me. I've been going to Comfy Nail semi-regularly since the tornado destroyed my go-to salon, Lee Nails. I get acrylics with a gel polish. Let me start by saying, I always liked how they turned out and service was always fine. However, I don't know if it's something with the quality of the nails or the technique, but the sets I received from them would break so much faster than anywhere else. Probably enough of a difference to make me want to find another salon, but then Covid happened. Franklin's salons opened back up before nashville so I started driving there to Ombré Nail for the time being. They were fantastic but completely out of my way. The main guy at ombré was talking to me about where I had been going before covid and said that he had actually helped open Comfy Nails. So that spurred me to give them another chance, seeing that it was so much more convenient for me anyways. Today was my second time going back since I decided to give them another shot and it pretty much sealed the deal that I need to find another salon. I came in around 1030 and was told they couldn't get me in until 215. Totally fine. So I came back at 215, told to wash my hands as always and then seated in a chair to wait and choose my color. Another issue to point out is I don't really love their selection of colors. They definitely have quite a few to pick from but if you are picky like me, there's such a fine line between a shade that looks classy and a shade that looks trashy. Anyways, I saw one on the swatch I liked but when I started looking at the actual bottles on the wall, I noticed it had a weird sheen to it that wasn't what I was going for. So then I just started looking at the other bottles and saw one I liked. Picked it up to take a closer look and compare the # to the swatch, but there wasn't a swatch for this. That's when a girl from the back came out and told me that customers aren't allowed to touch the bottles and that she needed it so she could sanitize. Let me be clear. I completely understand this and probably should've thought of that on my own. I am so glad they are taking covid protocols seriously. However, she had a super rude tone to her voice and said it a lot louder than necessary in my opinion. Maybe I'm just sensitive but it just kind of embarrassed me a bit. Then she goes up to the guy at the front who makes the appointments and checks everyone in and chastised him for allowing me to do that. This is the same guy that has always checked me in and he has been nothing but friendly every time I'm in there. I really didn't like how she spoke to him and all things considered, he was speaking to another customer behind a wall while I was looking at the polishes. He never saw me pick up the bottles so it really wasn't his fault. The girl could've taken a different tone with me and definitely could've waited to say something to the front desk guy behind closed doors. She just had an attitude of sorts and considering I was already iffy on this place, it was just the final straw for me. I told the front desk guy to cancel my appointment and left. Maybe they will put up a ""no touching"" sign on the bottles and maybe this particular employee will be more mindful of her tone in the future.",2021-01-16 00:18:40,735,3426,

I was told there would be a $85 service charge/install. I was then given options about a battery and was given different warranty terms. They offered I believe 1,3,5. I said the 3 would be fine, I was told for only $20 more I could get the 5 year. I was told my total price would be $300. I assumed ( trusting the company) I was being charged for a $200 quality battery and then the $85 install charge/servicing fee. I did not inquire about the battery and that's my fault for not doing that but I'm too trustful I guess. When looking at the retail price on the batteries website my battery was listed at $141 RETAIL so I'm sure they got a discount buying wholesale. Regardless I was charged $155 for the battery. $85 servicing. $45 for mobile charge and $10 for a using a credit card to pay. My total price was $310. Pretty shady they don't disclose this information to you up front. What I should have done was jumped my car, taken it to Autozone, paid $150 and they would have installed my battery for free since it was a simple install. So unless you're desperate or you don't care to pay double don't use them.

sKNFGag9vPdZwAaolzbezA,qx6Pzr86kwVEAWI_bZ_CBA,qxxpkyXHDdMjg-faTCu1bw,1,0,0,0,"I recently booked a one-month stay at 925 Common Street through Sonder, the short-term apartment rental company and found it an unacceptable stay. Any Sonder staff you contact will be in another state or country, not on site. And beware: Every apartment is different in this building, and the apartment in the photos is probably NOT the apartment you will get. The company does not show what the apartments really look like. We did NOT get the apartment or the features that we paid for. When we checked in and entered, we found the apartment was a completely different space from what we paid for, and completely different from the photos you see listed -- different windows, different layout, different furniture, different amenities. It did not have the features that we needed for our one-month stay and was not acceptable. To top it off, there was leftover food in the refrigerator, which indicates the apartment had not been cleaned or sanitized. After nearly three hours of texting and calling (including being on hold for an extended period on the phone, since Sonder doesn't like to use Airbnb's official messaging center), a man showed up to show us 2 additional apartments that were available. We chose the one that did have the features we needed -- but it was still NOT the apartment advertised in this listing. Sonder is a large company, and not a single staff member ever explained what happened to the apartment we'd paid for, or why it wasn't available. Nor did they offer any form of compensation for the inconvenience of having to view other apartments and move all of our luggage late at night. After settling into the 2nd apartment, we realized that it had no towels, the washing machine didn't work, and there was no streaming TV service (the listing promises Chromecast). We didn't receive towels until the afternoon of the following day, when the washing machine was also fixed. In addition, a tech guy showed up to try to install Chromecast, but with no success. He gave up. We were left with their free TV service (no streaming possible), and the system doesn't even have CNN, MSNBC, HGTV or other basic cable channels -- but it does have a lot of home shopping channels. Lovely. Also, the building itself is poorly maintained. It is a high-rise with five elevators, yet only ONE worked properly during our entire one-month stay; a second elevator only goes UP first, so you'd have to ride up to the 16th floor before going down. That elevator went out of service several times, creating extended waits and crowding in the only working elevator, which is extremely dangerous during a pandemic as it makes social distancing impossible. The Sonder corporate staff is quick to respond with prewritten, canned answers to complaints, and they were able to get us into that second apartment, but bottom line: We didn't get what we paid for, and there was no explanation why. Staying with a corporate conglomerate like Sonder -- where the staff you speak with is in far-flung states and countries, not on site -- appears to be too big a risk if you can't be guaranteed you'll get the apartment, features and services that you pay for.",2021-01-06 21:39:48,621,3153,

I'm a new homeowner and needed the furnace looked at. They said the unit was in such bad shape that they couldn't do anything to it. So no service was performed.

Plus, it's open 24 hours & late night options are limited on this side of town. I tried to visit on opening night, but the line was long & my stomach was empty, so I went elsewhere. Tonight, I finally got to try Rivas @11:30pm, after ending a busy restaurant shift. I ordered the steak fries & my boyfriend ordered the carne asada plate w/ corn tortillas. It cost $24 & some change, which seemed somewhat pricey considering we didn't even get drinks. But, we hoped the carne asade was worth it & also a good indicator of the quality of the food. We got our heavy bags, went home & were extremely disappointed once we opened the containers. 
I will lead with the postive: the portions are HUGE...I guess that's the only positive, honestly. I had very few bites of my steak fries. Immediately, the flavor of the meat bothered me. It tasted like it had been cooked on the same dirty griddle from the old philly cheesesteak restaurant that used to be in the same location. It smelled and tasted of old grease, which is really odd because they have completely transformed the building & it should be like new. The guacamole was obviously pre-packaged; it had the bright color and flavor of store bought guac, which was a little disappointing. I was hoping there would be fresh avocados at a Mexican restaurant, but maybe I expect too much. I would have gladly paid as much for 2 pounds less of the steak fries & real guacamole instead. Also, there really wasn't much to the actual fries. Yeah, there was like 10 pounds (ok maybe 3) but it was fries, gross meat, cheese & gross guac. 
On to my BF's food....as you can see in the pic, it is not the carne asada plate that he ordered, but actually what looks to be steak fajitas. He didn't try his. He doesn't eat bell peppers & I think the disappointment of the incorrect order ruined his appetite. I tried it and couldn't get past the flavor of this same gross meat. Didn't try the rice or beans. Didn't care at that point. 
I feel like my 3 stars rating is generous because I will most likely never go back. I wish they gave people reasonable portions, with fresher ingredients and took the time to make sure everything they handed us was correct & something they would actually want to eat themselves.

I came here with my friend on a Thursday night! It wasn't packed but it wasn't full and wait times for the food were good even though they said it would take some time! The waiters were very nice and kept checking in on us to see if everything was fine! I found this to be one of the better sushi spots than many others I've tried (but haven't reviewed) in Tampa.

Spice Tuna Tacos- these were great appetizers! Light & fresh tasting (a lot of sushi restaurants in tampa, I find, don't have very fresh tasting fish). The shells were thick and crispy (maybe too thick?) and the sauce it was covered in was lightly salted (probably soy) sweetened with some sugar! Only issue I have with it is that I really didn't taste or see any or very little cucumber. That would have made this very refreshing.  4/5

Nabeyaki Udon- this was a delicious soup! However, we were wishing there was more broth or less tempura bits in the soup because it took all the broth. The flavour was awesome and the udon was a nice thickness but I wish if were a little bit more elastic. Ithat elasticness would have given it a chewier Texture. The tempura bits were great (you also get a tempura sweet potato slice, which was not mentioned). Everything that was served with the soup tasted fresh and nice. 4/5

[Fire] Volcano Roll- it was my preferred of the two special rolls we ordered! My main complaint was that this was extremely saucy- to the point where you couldn't taste the fish. This would be great for non-sushi lovers, but not great for people who like the fresh taste of the fish. The broiled salmon was delicious with the sauce though. Otherwise, the the California roll was delicious. 4/5

Double Spicy Tuna Roll- it's literally double the tuna you would get in a regular roll. My complaint would be the same as the volcano roll, too much sauce and mayo on it! This would have been a great if it weren't drowned by the sauces and the cream cheese. 3/5",2021-01-31 06:43:26,427,2029,

She recommended I try their delicious churro flavored coffee of the day! The coffee was perfectly smooth and not too sweet. Surprisingly it didn't taste artificial- I'm usually not a big fan of flavored coffee but this was delicious. I downed it on the drive before even getting home and regretted not getting a bigger size. I grabbed a cold grilled chicken breast and a 1/2 lb of their cold orzo pasta salad to enjoy once I got home. The gentleman that helped me with the food said he didn't believe they seasoned either of their grilled salmon or chicken- I opted for chicken in case I needed to dip it into bbq or something- unseasoned or under salted salmon is a nightmare in my opinion- he was sweet and said they had salt and pepper packets to which I laughed and said no thanks- he understood. Haha so I got home and started sipping on the yummy iced tea and heated up my chicken breast which to my surprise WAS seasoned and very flavorful!! The orzo was also yummy! I was able to pick up some baked goods for my boys as well. Including a vegan and gluten free cookie for my kiddo with food allergies, a pleasant surprise! They also get you in and out of there asap which is so freaking nice. It's also kept very clean! At other grocery stores they are always understaffed and almost never offer to charge you out at the deli counter- NOT HERE! They are fast and efficient and extremely friendly! I'll be back when in the area for sure! It's definitely in a ritzy side of town inside of the la encantada mall so the prices match. For the customer service you receive and the amount of options they have it's worth the price. Unfortunately my boys inhaled their baked goods so I didn't snap a pic but I will share a pic of the chicken and orzo salad. From the bakery we got a chocolate cupcake, large cannoli and a vegan gf snickerdoodle cookie AND a slice of the most delicious lemon creme cake for me!

-expired items galore, check the dates of EVERYTHING

-coupons that you apply to your account via mobile app will not show up at the register upon checkout nor will they be applied

-""one way"" aisles that are 2-way chaos 

-sky high prices on many items: for example babybel cheese will cost $3-4 at Trader Joe's. Here? $10! 

-""sale"" prices that aren't rung up as such upon rendering payment. Check your receipt or just expect to pay regular price on everything. Otherwise the process of getting a manager takes forever and they don't even care to rectify the issue. 

-there's a little clearance rack back by the bathrooms, so that's cool


today we did a huge order of nearly $300. We were supposed to get a solid $20 in savings that didn't materialize on the receipt...

In this pandemic and over a holiday weekend, we frankly didn't bother to go back into the store with our (further) rotting perishable foodstuffs in the vehicle to undertake a consumer justice mission more aggravating and complex than the treaty of Versailles, the Potsdam agreement, camp David accords, etc etc.

While none of the dishes I ordered at this establishment stood out as particularly bad, I believe that a Philadelphia resident can eat food of similar style at other restaurants in the city which are superior in both their menu selection and quality. 
To start, The Love's cheese plate, Labor of Love, certainly does not lack in portion size. While the selected cheeses pleased the palate, the bread was unimpressive and could do with some varying. Moreover, one should not order this dish in a party fewer than 3 people, as my dining comrade and I were unable to finish the cheese board, leaving me wondering whether it was wise to spend $24 on semi-uneaten dairy.
Let us move on to the Southern Style Hush Puppies: nothing impressive here. Of course, it would take an astounding lack of intelligence to screw up a deep-fried cornmeal, so I cannot say that this dish tasted ""bad,"" per se, but I could have done without it.
The Ruby Beet Risotto: likely my favorite dish from the night, and I would recommend ordering this starter if you choose to dine at The Love. The pomegranate was an excellent touch and a topping of crispy kale complemented the risotto in a delightful manner. Don't expect to taste beet in this dish though (although its name led me to naively expect otherwise). 
As for the Pulled Brisket Fazzoletti: failed to disappoint, yet also failed to blow my mind in any way. While the brisket was cooked well and pulled apart beautifully, the broccoli in this dish appeared as a sad afterthought, lacking any purpose, like a side salad that always shows up at pizza parties and remains neglected in the corner of a basement. I likely would have done better ordering the famous Love fried chicken. Who knows.

In terms of outdoor seating in the winter: The Love exceeded expectations. I was seated in an enclosed and heated ""love shack,"" which offered my dining companion and myself with a quiet, warm environment. 

Will I be returning to The Love soon? Likely not. But let us be honest with ourselves. As much as Katherine Heigl bores us, we always end up re-watching 27 Dresses on some lonely Friday night. In a similar vein, I could see myself dining once more at this restaurant.",2021-01-17 23:54:06,484,2413,

They combine two of my favorite things, ice cream and donuts.  Yesssss, please. They almost got 5 stars easily, but you can not go in the shop.  It is drive thru only. The dining area is closed. Part of going to an ice cream parlor is the experience where you can see the ice cream in the freezer, sample some flavors and ask questions face to face before making one of the biggest decisions of you life....what ice cream to get. Plus for those who have a long drive, it is hard to have the ice cream sit for the 30-40 drive home. Do I pull over and eat it or do I speed home and hope not to get a ticket in the process.  Devouring it in their dining area would solve that dilemma.

They have daily flavors available and are on the board as you drive up. Some flavors are there one day and then may be gone the next, if not the same day. Anyway, of course I got the donut sandwich with raspberry rumble ice cream.  I could not wait to get home and dig in. It did not disappoint.  My crew got a cup of the cookie monster, cookies and creme and strawberry.  They all loved their ice cream too.  Theirs did not make it home. The staff there was so friendly. They even showed us what some of the ice cream that we were not familiar with looked like such as the cloud, which by the way is cotton candy on a cone.

I am sure they will get that 5th star from me soon.  They have exquisite ice cream, top notch staff and donuts. What more do you need?  I can not wait to get back here.  Hopefully the parlor will be open for dine in by then. I highly recommend checking this place out to satisfy your sweet tooth.",2021-01-31 00:45:21,377,1713,

My first visit to Havana Dreamers Cafe was immediately enhanced by my server Felicia. She should be the mentor for all restaurant servers! Great friendly greeting and she did everything she could to please me. I felt for a moment like I was in a fine dining restaurant. 

You'll literally see lots of references to the owners family with pictures galore adorning walls and table tops making a unique statement about their strong Cuban ancestral roots. 

Inside eating is permissible however on beautiful days you may want to enjoy their outside seating which is plentiful. 

I was thrilled that Havana Dreamers has continued the Tampa tradition of serving deviled crab, empanadas, black bean soup and two different types of Cuban sandwiches. The traditional Cuban mostly served in Tampa eateries with ham and pork is referred to as their ""Miami,"" Cuban. Then they inject a new twist adding freshly sliced salami in addition to the regular Cuban. I went with Felicia's recommendation and chose the salami.
This is one of if not the best Cuban sandwich I've ever eaten, packed full with meat and the roll was perfect. I topped it off with great tasting freshly brewed  cafe con leche and some homemade banana muffins for dessert. My server says flan will be added as a dessert soon.

What to do at 6:30am?  Breakfast IS served! Meals and more till 4! All reasonably priced.

Service  was excellent up until it came to pay the bill and our plates were cleared. We had a wonderful lady server in the beginning who brought us everything and she also asked if we wanted more bread. Then at the end of our meal, a guy waiter (with heavy accent) came over to start taking our plates away. I was still taking the last bites off mine and had to tell him I'm still working on it since he asked me if he could take my plate. After that he kept going in and out of the restaurant to clear other tables and do things and never came back by to check on us or at least bring us the bill. We had to actually call out for him to stop to ask to bring us the check. He said he would bring it out. So he did and then we stuck $100 bill in there and he took it back shortly after. How long does it take to get us change from cash??? Like 10 minutes went by and he kept walking back and forth in and outside to do whatever he was doing. Again we had to ask him for our change. We were thinking he was trying to pull a fast one on us like he thought we were giving him a $60 tip and that we would just leave??? He wasn't even our waiter. He made up some excuse like his manager was busy or something so I thought maybe they had to check the $100?? I don't know. But he finally brought out the change. It was just really weird and no communication we just felt ignored!!!",2021-01-20 14:19:20,324,1415,

The illustrious $5, 24oz margarita is what brought me into this regional hot spot. I've had the gallon sangria to-go before and felt confident this would be an equally fun, heavy on the sweet, light on the liquor margarita. Which is exactly what it is. I'm sorry but Chili's who!? This is literally just like that, but somehow better? 

Why is it better? Well mostly because the food it is accompanied by is leaps and bounds better. But also, thanks to some really great service. Service alone, this is a 5 out of 5 dinner, no doubt. When our server was too busy to help us, another stepped in. It's obvious that they work as a team, and I really appreciate and respect that. And the food comes out fast! 

As far as the food goes. It's good. It's not anything amazing. And it's also not exactly cheap(?). The deals rotate daily. On Wednesday it's wanna be shrimp for $6. It's like Bonefish but somehow better? Do you get the pattern here? 

Overall I get the hype. There are so many TVs, the Bud Light is $2.50 all day, every day. The mixed drinks won't knock you on your butt. This is like primo ""hang out for 4 hours to watch a game"" territory. And even during covid times I feel comfortable doing exactly that. 

Unfortunately there is no hand sanitizer at the tables (it's okay we bring our own). The booths did have some additional plexi glass between them. 

My biggest hardship with this meal was trying to enjoy myself with the calories listed on everything. I know this is a corporate America thing-but gosh darn, I very much disliked it. In fact, I hated it. Who do we have to talk to, to abolish that?? Nutritional information should be available upon request. That is all for my Yelp talk.

First and foremost. I'll preserve the people the embarrassment and not call out the names.

I'm in a same-sex relationship. I was with my in laws as my partner was at work. He needed a new truck. 

We stopped in this Ferman Chevrolet and had sales associate #1. He was very polite and very knowledgeable. We were specific in a need for a vehicle. They had only a few 4x4 vehicles and we found one we liked. Although it was ultimately up to my partner.  The vehicle on the sticker says 45.998 

Online however it says ""priced to sell"" and list the price for 40.448. 

We would be an all cash buyer. Maybe this is why they ended up being rude?  Let's continue. 

Monday- I had reserved the price quote for 40.448 and had requested call back info. Sales associate #2 was very nice and responsive but ultimately was not there. 
 Tuesday. Sales associate #1 and #2 were not available. 
Well my same sex partner and his parents ended up getting to the dealership and had a sales associate #3 who was underwhelming. He was not knowledgeable. He also seemed uninterested and stressed that he had to deal with my family. He also said the vehicle was 49,998 and when we called out online it says 40,448 and that we were there the day before and the guy said 45,998 which it did have a sticker (missing) he told us it wasn't the truck we were interested in even tho screenshots and photos prove otherwise. Not sure if this is the representation all Ferman Chevrolet needs.  He didn't want to engage etc. My guy was able to test drive and was able to have things that were not working (this is CERTIFIED PRE OWNED) sales associate #3 signed and told him that he can pay the 700$ to get it fixed. We were surprised how rude he was. My father in-law gave him an all cash offer, very reasonable with some of the needs to be corrected in consideration & sales associate #3 said ""have a nice night"" and walked away. He was not a sales manager. Or GM of the dealership. Based on this experience. We will NEVER buy one of your cars. Your reps were great but ultimately being rude, disrespectful and leaving a bad taste in our mouth. 

Your dealership seems to discriminate against same-sex couples as your sales associate #3 demonstrated. 


Please everyone. Don't fall for the bait & switch or the fact they have ""certified pre owned"" vehicles. They also have some sort of markup for commission and these uneducated sales reps will not make money off me or my friends/family.",2021-01-05 20:17:54,523,2530,

I know the word 'perfect' is all but impossible to achieve in the eyes of some but I'm putting it out there ...this pizza is simply, perfect. The sauce has a certain sweetness, tang, the cheese offers an ingredient to balance the sauce and the crust ...is unreal.

If you're a fan of softer edges for your crust, this is your spot. If you're not a fan, no problem. Make sure to submit your suggestions on 'how' you'd like your pizza cooked and they'll line it up without question. The amount of cheese and sauce on top was perfect. When I made my order online, I specifically asked for extra sauce and they made it happen. 

When I opened the box, I wanted to eat the whole thing and refrained... which is great because now I have leftovers. I should have had three, maybe even, two slices but I couldn't stop eating the food. I had four. I'm still really full but it was completely worth it. As Joey once said during an episode of 'Friends', ""I'm not even sorry.""

This city has a lot of people who favor (insert the only spot they get pizza, their friend's place because... they're friends or whatever reason they chose the pizza place they're headed for the night) pizza place. I used to be one of those who'd only go to the same 4 spots until I realized that I was probably missing out on a lot of great food.

We were not given menus. When we finally found a server and mentioned that we would like menus we were told to use our phones, scan the QR code and that would bring us a menu. 

It worked, but what a lame ass way to handle menus. I asked what would have happened if we didn't have phones. We were told we would be given one menu to share. It's a covid thing.

Ok, how about printing the menu on paper and throwing thme out after use?  Save more time and money than wipping down the few menus thet said they actually hand out and it always works for kids menus.

We ordered the spinach cheese quaso. After a reasonable wait, we were given the wrong quaso. It took 20 minutes to for the server to make her way back to us to tell her. She said she was sorry, that we could eat what we were served and she would get the right quaso. Fine.

We both ordered the 6 oz steak (knowing it's Chilis you expect very little for steak that is why I went small). 

One was ordered with corn on the cob, rare stake and mased potatoes.
One was ordered with brocolli, medium stake and mashed potatoes.

The steak and the vegatable came up together; the mashed potatoes were TDB.

The rare stake was well over medium, the medium was well over done. We sent back the  worst of the two.  

Since we were hungry, I ate my brocolli. I do belive they sauated it in their dirty dishwater. It was VILE. 

The second stake came back and it was medium, but it was also past 930 so we ate our steak. One over cooked, one over cooked and now cold.

As we were finsihing up we were told that the mask potatoes weren't going to happen, the kitchen was having issues. My dinner guest ordered another price of corn on the cob, I, feeling not well thank you brocolli and nasty meat, skipped replacing the potato.

A few minutes later we were both served mashed potatoes. Sure, they were ICE COLD but hey, they were mashed.  We refused to eat them. 

When we got the check, they gave us credit for one steak. 

Considering the meals were 100% garbage, not served together, not cooked properly and so on and on, it should of been free. Since I wasn't feeling wel - THANKS BROCOLLI) we just left. We scudded the rest of our evening plans, I drove home, was up all night feeling like crap and had the runs.

We chose to eat at Indo (way before Covid-this is a very late review!) because it was new and we had heard such great reviews, so we decided this would be a perfect place for a date night. 

Upon entry, it was a very small, and dark space, yet so intimate. I actually enjoyed being somewhat closer to other tables because I could spy on the food they had received before we ordered. 

The menu was easy to read and had the perfect amount of options. I get too overwhelmed when their are 1000 items to chose from. A smaller menu makes me feel the items are more curated and thoughtful. 

We ordered based on recommendations from the server, which if I can remember were the following items: the black green beans, hamachi, a seafood,coconut milk curry, and lastly the crab and rice dish. 

The green beans were unique. My boyfriend was actually surprised he liked them as he wasn't sure about the sauce they came on, but they turned out to be very flavorful. I loved them and they were the perfect amount of crisp and charred. The hamachi was heaven with the fish being so light and airy that it basically melted in our mouths. The seafood curry made me want to slurp the bowl and we actually had a talk about who was allowed to eat the broth at the end. We only wish we had had some rustic bread to dip up all the deliciousness. 

The crab dish, we were told, would take about 30 minutes, which is why we ordered a couple of starters and that was to be expected based on what was stated on the menu. 

Surprisingly, we were gifted some lamb ribs (we had been wavering about whether to order them in the beginning, but decided against it) to eat while we waited for the crab, which was unexpected, yet welcomed with open arms! It was so fantastic. The meat fell off the bones and the brown sauce was like nothing I had tried before. 

Sadly, I was SO full when the rice dish came out that I only had a couple bites, but my partner had no problem finishing the dish and had nothing but rave reviews about the way in which the crab and rice were cooked. 

We did have a couple cocktails to start, which I can't remember what they were because the dinner overpowered them all, so I can't comment on those, however I know they were tasty as well. 

Having lived on both coasts and developed quite the palate, I can't give this place any less than 5 starts from the ambiance, the friendly wait staff, and the quality of the food.

It is a fried chicken thigh seasoned beautifully, topped with a pat of honey butter, and nestled inside a fluffy, sweet biscuit. I was so excited for this sandwich! I knew I would like it and I was not disappointed. I am a big fan of sweet and savory and this breakfast sandwich hits the mark and so much more.

The biscuit is buttery with a sweetness that is not overpowering. It is tender and fluffy on the inside and is toasted to create a slight caramelized exterior which makes it perfect as a sandwich bun. I love that the chicken is a thigh instead of the typical chicken breast which can be dry when not cooked well. There is just enough breading which is seasoned really well. You get a bit of the hot chicken taste that balances with the sweet notes of the biscuit and glorious honey butter. 

I also tried a few of the donuts. They rotate their flavors and I was really hoping to try the Vietnamese coffee one but unfortunately it was not a featured flavor for that day. I opted for the Christmas King cake that was recommended by the staff. It was really sweet but that should have been expected with the colored sugar on top. The cream cheese filling was sparse and I found the texture of the donut itself was too dense for my liking. 

I went back the next day to bring some of those chicken biscuit sandwiches home, four to be exact, to share with family. I also picked up the turtle cheesecake donut and cinnamon roll to try. The turtle cheesecake was like the other donut. The filling was lacking and texture was dense. The brûlée topping on the cinnamon roll didn't work for me. I'm just not a fan of their donuts, but I can eat the heck out of those chicken biscuits! 

The employees were fun, energetic, and very welcoming. The atmosphere was hip and lively with an industrial building vibe. They have a few tables for dine in with alternating ones blocked off for social distancing. I was also told they have patio seating in the back.

Large portions, good service. Old Hickory-amazing food! Expensive, but a convenient, upscale restaurant on the premises.

First we sat down to only find out that they hadn't attained their liquor license yet so we could only select from beer or soft drinks. If this was a different circumstance we may have walked out at that very moment but we were with our 7month old and getting out of the house is already tricky enough so we still gave it a shot. We started with a few starters like the popcorn which is dusted with porcini powder - underwhelming. We ordered the mushroom toast. Also nothing to ride home about. I didn't find the bread to be good at all. Something about the texture just wasn't right. Then the kicker- I ordered a main because we were starving and my husband and I thought we'd share and get out of there quickly since we were with our little one dining out is a bit unpredictable. I ordered the Marsala with pasta option. I switched out the pork for chicken and it was served with bucatini. The presentation was awful. It was minimal pasta served with overwhelming amount of sauce. The chicken didn't taste fresh, it was cut in cubes already not an appetizing way to present chicken in my opinion. On top of that the chicken tasted like it had been previously frozen or something because it had a weird texture and taste. After trying one piece I decided I couldn't eat the rest. So I just picked at the pasta portion only because again I was so hungry and we bolted out of there. Needless to say we picked up Thai food on our way home because we were still hungry and it was just that bad of an experience. Sorry Chrysalis but today just wasn't your day. Gave it couple stars because ambiance wasn't bad. The place could redeem itself MAYBE once they have real drinks available and have a better chef.",2021-01-16 08:09:08,370,1823,

The problem is, once you walk in, you over overwhelmed (in the most literal sense of the word) with visual stimuli.  Every inch of every possible space is jam packed with all kinds of trim, ribbons, earrings, craft supplies -- you name it!  Luckily, the staff is quite knowledgeable on what they have, so they can direct you onto the right path, but if you do not have a shopping agenda, you could easily slip down the rabbit hole and not come up for hours!

I was out stocking up my decorating supplies and had already stopped at the glitter store, but was looking for trim.  I found exactly what I was looking for, and then some, to ensure that all of my throws this year have the feel that I want.  Some of the items felt more overpriced, but to support a local shop, it didn't bother me too much.  Also?  They have all kinds of elastic.  In the world of a pandemic when it was hard for the bigger stores to keep it in stock, Gary's kept the greater New Orleans area stocked with elastic for all of the masks and PPE you could ever hope to create!  No wonder Joann's was sending their customers here.

Great shop, but go in knowing what you what, or go in knowing that you might be there for a very long time to explore the small shop.  Either way, you're probably going to come out with what you want (whether you needed it or not)!",2021-01-01 14:49:17,305,1391,

Went inside, it was good but not a great Po' Boy like I'd expect at a top Cajun restaurant.  Hook & Reel has the normal seafood decor, like Red Lobster, McGrath's (sad about them), Joe's, etc. with a Louisiana twist. 
I thought I'd get the oyster Po Boy, a New Orleans standard with fried oysters, shredded iceberg lettuce, sliced tomatoes, and a remoulade aioli sauce (spicy Mayo).   It was nice on a fresh sliced toasted French baguette, but they were skimpy with the smallish oysters. I believe there were only 3 or 4 total. The oyster basket with fries included most everything else the same for roughly the same price--and with more oysters!! I should have gotten that.  Instead of fries, I paid extra for clam chowder. It had lots of potatoes, few clams. The oyster crackers with it were on point and soaked up the clam juice broth. That was nice. 
  I was alone, next time I'll go with others--the crab boils appear to be the standout items on the menu.  I saw and smelled the steam fest at the table next to me. The spicy plastic bag of fun looked great. Although I've never found anyplace that gets everything cooked just right at the same time...I saw sausage, mussels, shrimp, snow and Dungeness crab, crawfish, plus corn cobs and red potatoes in there. They have several seasoning choices as well. I should have taken pictures!

The pricing system makes little sense. If you call in the  time frame of when they say your assessment will be done, they will not answer. They will not tell you what is wrong with your device (in the event you bring it in for acting in a way that doesn't make sense to you) and will just go ahead and make whatever repairs they deem necessary, without your consult. 
I had a repair done on my laptop that cost more than half the value of the  laptop and - surprise! the problem isn't even fixed. I will not  bring my computer back  to this location because  I do not trust the staff for a second - to make actual repairs, to reliably and honestly answer my questions, or to be have basic customer service. 
I called  after the time frame when my computer  was  meant to be 'assessed'  and quickly found my number blocked. Finally, after two weeks, I made an appointment using an alternative phone number.  I  was told that my computer had been  done for more than a week. When asked why no one called if it was  done, I was met with a shrug. 

I didn't read the yelp reviews before bringing it in and I regret it. Your computer will not be fixed, but by time you get it back - still with problems -  you'll be so grateful to finally get your device back you'll pay the money and leave.

You saunter up to the bar for a drink or two (if it's not packed, the server may come to your table and you can place an order with them), and you waltz yourself up to the food selection to get a snack.  Post-COVID, you must wait to have them serve you from the buffet selection of hummus, 1 or 2 selections of soup, fruit, nuts, and other small snacks.  Not a big deal, unless you're a pig like me who desires 3 or 4 bowls of crab bisque (don't judge me), and you have to ask to be served.  Their smile is friendly, but on the inside, they're saying, ""This girl again?  With the soup?  Her pants already look a little tight! And she spilled some on her blouse!""

Yes, I want more soup.  I'm not sorry.

That being said, the service is always friendly here.  I can usually strike up a conversation with someone working here about where I'm from.  They will cater to all of your needs (most of them, anyways.  Why does that sound dirty?).

I've never had to wait to get in, nor have I had trouble finding somewhere to sit while I wait for my flight.  It's conveniently located right past security, towards the A gates (directions from the Priority Pass website.  I wish they would tell me more specific directions since I tend to get lost, but it's accurate).  It really IS right past security towards the A gates.  Look for the sign and elevator to your right and drinks will be in your near future.

Besides the weird bar layout (I forgot to take a picture, next time.  It's hard to explain.  Scope it out yourself), there's not much that differentiates this from other airport lounges.

I am honestly baffled by the great reviews because we didn't enjoy any part of our experience. When we got there we were seated at a table in he front of the restaurant. There weren't many if any other patrons and Burbon street was surprisingly busy. The staff were actively encouraging people passing by to come in and dine. Despite this we waited a long time to even have a server come over to the table (more than 10 mins). During this time the hostess made eye contact with us several times and still didn't send the waiter over not to mention that at least 10 other staffers were just chatting and hanging around. I'm in the hospitality industry and I was surprised to see so many people 'working' doing nothing. This was at 7:30pm which would normally be peak time but isn't clearly as busy right now. We were about to leave when the waiter came over and advised that he hadn't seen us as the tables used to be high tops. My partner gave me the option to stay or go and with the waiter seeming genuine I opted for us to stay which I regret. The food was disappointing (all of it). The poutine has too much cheese sauce, the pasta was flavorless and so was the steak. I didn't eat much of mine and the waiter just didn't seem to notice. In the end they didn't offer a comp drink for the delay in service. Being in the business it's the least you can do when the service doesn't live up to the customer's expectation.

Sadly it was too good to be true... I at first loved it the room looked nice upon me first entering it and the lobby was nice with friendly staff which was great. Sadly though the room I was in had a bathroom that was clearly not cleaned. You could see the water marks on the tub bottom from what I assumed to be the last shower since you could even see the splash marks then the wall of my shower was covered in another woman's hair as well. We also had concerns with the room next to us which involved a possible neglect issue going on but even if it wasn't they were screaming and yelling from 11pm-2am and it was loud enough you could hear it down the hall at times. At first I called the front desk and asked for someone to come up and just check in on them maybe ask them to quiet down a little. No one came up though at midnight I went down to the front desk and just reiterated that I was concerned for the child in the room and they assured me they would send security up there and then determine if they needed to call the police sadly it sounded like they came up and didn't hear anything for the whole five minutes it calmed down and yet again nothing was done. Now it did end up calming down around two and yes I did look into other things I could do but there wasn't much without me having actually seen the child. But over all I didn't feel like the late night staff was as friendly or caring as the day staff and honestly the security guy was an older man walking around watching videos on his phone and joking around with the front desk guy instead of keeping an eye out for security related things... Over all I don't feel it was a great 4 star experience though I will say you get what you pay for which was more of a 2 star price...,2021-01-09 15:29:40,393,1871,

Apparently, this is the place to stay in St Pete. This was a great location, right in the middle of downtown. Parking is free and there really was no need to drive anywhere. We walked everywhere the entire weekend. The building has a lot of history...that being said. Certain rooms are renovated and some aren't. The ac units in the windows have birds living in them. Nothing more annoying then hearing chirping early in the morning. Lucky for us, we didn't have any birds. The pool area is very nice and relaxing. Certain mornings they do have yoga. There's an outdoor bar area if you need a drink. The staff is friendly and there to serve you. When I was laying out, there is a person walking around asking if you would like some water. Coming here in June, you sometimes forget how easily dehydrated you can become. There's a restaurant inside and a coffee bar at the end. The decor is beautiful and I recommend taking a walk up the stairs. You will see some wonderful pictures. Our room was one of the renovated rooms(pretty happy about that) so I'm not sure what the original rooms compared too. Our room was nicely decorated and clean. There's a small refrigerator inside, which came in very handy. Especially, after waking up hung over and desperately wanting my leftover sub in the refrigerator.

However, this business is laughably unprofessional. First, as others have already mentioned, they blasted some folks on Facebook for giving a ""horrible"" review; however, said review was never found, as this business owner is of the kind that just deletes what she doesn't like or what doesn't go with her grain. Secondly, after deleting the review, she then posts some email exchanges that clearly show the people's names/emails. Honestly, there was nothing diabolical about it; just typical exchange of what a business can or cannot offer, then some anger from the customer as the business wouldn't offer those services. All around, that should have been DONE. Like done done, because to me -- outside looking in -- that's a normal occurrence for any business. However, for whatever reason, this business owner and her ""they don't like me, so I'm super mad"" mentality blasted these people on Facebook.

Apparently, she was expecting, YET AGAIN, to get people to pat her ego and give her a bunch of ""atta girls"" and 'Likes' of affirmation that she and her business are phenomenal. That's not how it went down, because most people are logical thinkers and not of the coddling nature -- or so I'd like to believe. So, when she was deservedly told how wrong it was of her under her business pseudonym to just blast people, she then chose to retort back of how those people are wrong and how awful those people are for even suggesting such a thing.

After 70+ comments of disapproval, it got to the point where the business owner deleted the whole string (predictable, right?) and then turns to Yelp!, where she is now affronting on those that write similar reviews to this one, no doubt.

BUT! That still was not enough to get me to write this review. Because, I get it, we all have bad days -- she had an especially bad one with many bad decisions made; but that doesn't warrant me to -- what she hypocritically coined as 'social media bullying' -- join in and state my piece.

However, when I decided to scroll through these other reviews, I was astonished (not really) to see that this wasn't just an off day. This business owner will demean and minimize the most de minimis of reviews; ones that are not even all that bad or emotional, just simply what they experienced. 

I was able to grab some screen shots of some of the post and comments. Also, is a screen shot of a review in here and their response.

Here's a pointer, if you don't want a bad review, don't be shitty to people and do bad business.",2021-01-21 21:01:47,570,2702,

I took my Portuguese Water Dog for his first grooming here as I heard a lot of positive reviews from other dog owners in the neighborhood and considering their schedule was always busy, I assumed they must be good.  When I dropped off my pup, I specifically asked that they not cut too much off as we like his hair to be kept longer and pointed out some large matted hair behind his left ear which they said they could remove without cutting the rest of him too short.  There was a similar mat that was on his right ear which I had worked out myself using dog tangler and a lot of time and patience so I know it was something that could be removed by someone who does this for living.  I kept repeating to the female groomer that I did not want my pup's hair to be trimmed too short, but the entire time it seemed like she was not hearing or listening to what I was telling her.  

Well as you may expect, when I picked up my pup 5hrs later, he was no longer recognizable; they cut his hair much shorter than they said they would.  I was in shock when I saw him, while the groomer kept stating if I wanted to keep his hair long, I needed to come back every 4 weeks since this grooming appointment was a 'reset'.  Well the groomer who I took him to before, which I will be returning back to never had to do a 'reset' to keep my pup's hair at the length I had asked.  The least they could have done was check in at some point during his grooming to ask if the length was appropriate, which I have had other groomers do in the past.  Other than the major mat behind his left ear which I would have been fine with them shaving since it was not in an area that was noticeable, they felt inclined to shave the rest of his hair everywhere else too, in most places with no mats.  

They may be good at grooming specific types of dogs (questionable depending on reviews you read), but if you want to keep your dog's hair long, I would strongly recommend against this place.  For the price they charge, they need to listen to their customers better and communicate more through the process if they are unsure if the owner will like the results. Also, based on their response to my review on another major search site, it is insulting and speaks to the type of business they are when they try to turn the blame on me for what was clearly their responsibility.

The spicy edamame was great quality and not very salty. I was a little disappointed the spicy was a dressing, but rather a spice. My favorite part of edamame is sucking all the flavor off the pod, so I was a little disappointed. However edamame still had great flavor and the spice certainly packed a punch.  7/10

I was tempted to do the sushi burrito, but figured I would stick the bowl for my first time. Just in case I didn't like the taste of something I could just take it off. The two bases I picked were the noodles and rice. I selected the poke soy sauce. The noodles were very light and not heavy. The poke soy sauce added to the flavor.

We arrived around 6 or 7pm and got a table for 2. We could have been seated right away outside or the bar but decided to wait for an inside table. That wait was only about 15 minutes.

Mellow Mushroom has a cool vibe to it. A very psychedelic, hippie, subtle use of the mushrooms to infer a certain ""state of mind"". They pride themselves on all-natural ingredients. They also offer gluten free and vegan options.

Our server was around quick and took our drink orders and then an appetizer. We got the bruschetta. They only offer paper straws and we had to ask for regular ones. Some paper straws are better than others and these ones tend to just fall apart at the bottom and the top. We're all for saving the environment, just don't like eating paper. However they do not even keep regular plastic straws in stock. We were given children's cup straws.

The bruschetta was excellent. Crispy pieces of bread stacked with tomatoes, basil, feta cheese and balsamic vinegar. Tasted fresh and it was really good!

For our dinner, we ordered the Mighty Meat pizza in the medium size. This 6 slice pizza had a flavorful red sauce with fresh mozzarella, pepperoni, sausage, ground beef, ham and bacon. With the many toppings, it's not overwhelming, not too salty but meaty for sure. The cheese was also perfect, not too much or too little. Their crust also hits high marks for me. It's made with what flour and Appalachian Spring Water. I noticed it was a darker dough and the flavor is perfect. The 6 slices was more than enough and we each had a piece to take home for later on.

So nice I had recently visited here for both Fall break and the week after Christmas right up to New Years. The price while high and it gets even higher once you factor in resort fees and parking would be my only challenge in reviewing it. The place is outstanding otherwise. Incredible and possibly the xth wonder of the world. If you haven't stopped in to see this place you should. If you are lucky enough to be able to stay here do so at least once. I did discover staying across the street at the Inn for part of my second stay to save money. The rooms are very nice and a good size. Two very comfortable queen beds. Some rooms have a balcony overlooking the inside atrium of the hotel as well. The pools one indoor and one outdoor are also very large but as the property is huge expect a long walk to the pool. Note this hotel is so large it is really like three hotels in one place so there may be an outdoor pool by the Magnolia wing and I think there is but i havent stayed on that side. Also very convenient is the sheer amount of food and drinks all in one place. This was extremely convenient on New Years eve. I could walk to dinner and eat. Then go back out to the bars to get drinks at my leisure. No driving parking and that kind of hassel. You are also within walking distance of the mall so you can easily walk over to the mall as well to eat at its many restaurants. Again no maid service during the virus so I just called the number to request any refills of items I needed.
The only drawbacks on this property are the astronomical parking costs $32 per day and you add to that the large resort fee of $20 and your out $52 each day before you even get going. Luckily the rates right now are as low as I have seen due to the complete halt of most business travel. I stayed at $169 on some days. Obviously they will vary the rate per days of week and time of year so New Years Eve was higher. There is an onsite water park as well called sound waves. I went the first trip and it is pretty nice, but it also is rather expensive. I want to think I paid around $230 for four people for the whole time I was staying there. It is not well represented the costs and also that the pass if you are a guest covers your length of stay.",2021-01-22 14:49:55,494,2313,

But it does have nice loop trails that connect so great for hiking. I went on the shorter trails:
1) Mica View trail: paved, great for a baby stroller 
2) Desert Ecology trail: short loop, paved 
3) Loma Verde trail: my favorite, goes through a woody area, across 2 washes and to the site of a cooper mine. I liked the variety of environments you passed through
4) Freeman Homestead: loop trail to the site of a homestead (no longer there).

The west side of the park is beautiful and full of Saguaros and views. The visitor center is nicely renovated and has a garden trail that I missed. The driving loop  here is unpaved and shorter. Again I visited the shorter trails:
1) Valley View trail: my favorite, ends with sweeping views of the valley. Easy but with small steps so not stroller friendly but definitely carrier friendly. 
2) Signal hill: cool petroglyphs on a small hill. Make sure to look at all sides for the 800year old drawings.

Like many people we ate outside on the back patio.  I was especially impressed by our waiter, Langdon.  He was the bar keep, server and in our case set up a heater, as the temperature was quite chilly in the early part of the evening.  His winning personality, attentiveness to detail was amazing.  He knew what drinks we had ordered, food that we selected and came back to check on us in just the right amount of time.  I never like restaurants where the server is overly attentive.  It is obvious that Langdon has had a lot of experience in the hospitality business.  He was wearing many hats and made his job seem easy.  The only unfortunate thing about eating by the pool was that you couldn't have a real martini glass, but instead had to settle for plastic.  I prefer my martini glass chilled, but in this case it didn't matter as it was so cold outside that the temperature remained in a chilled state.  I feel that Langdon should be made an assistant manager, as he joked with us and made us feel important, even though he had a lot of people to serve between the bar patrons and customers seated by the pool.  

My partner and I shared the Ruben Sandwich, which has always been a favorite of mine, and of course when dining out, and sharing, ordered the fries.  

In general, I feel the Hollander Hotel is one of the best restaurants to enjoy for the ambiance of the hotel lobby and front porch and when we can enjoy it again, the weekend brunch.

We ordered the following: Pad Thai, Pho with Filet, chicken fried rice with no veggie, Pad see ew, garlic noodles with shaken beef no cheese and popcorn chicken. Favorite was pad Thai, pho and popcorn chicken. The shaken beef was tender and medium cooked so if you like steak well done you may need to ask. The garlic noodles didn't seem to have flavor...maybe I needed the cheese for that. Pho had a clean taste to broth. Popcorn chicken was flavored well and super crispy. They provide a sweet chili sauce to dip. 

Dessert: they have 4 different flavor ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, cookies and cream and can't remember what the last one was. We ordered the 3. Ice cream was creamy. Love that they have more than just vanilla. Then for churros it was the original and cookies and cream. They were good! It was hot but it was good. Good crunch and cooked well in the middle. 

I ordered the coffee float...it was so creamy tasting. Also got the Thai tea...also creamy tasting. Good but like a second dessert. 

Service was good. We ordered at counter and got a number then they bring you the food. I had to ask for stuff and they were good about bringing them and clearing your table. Small place and ppl kept coming in to eat. Service was good. I did tip when I paid for my meal. Make sure u tip like your eating at a restaurant. They are still serving you. 

I would like to try Cajun wings next time.",2021-01-23 03:29:11,349,1595,

The service was amazing right off the bat; the hostess was friendly and professional, and our waiter was attentive and gave us the space and time to decide on what we wanted while offering suggestions and fielding any questions we had. Throughout the evening, everything came in a timely manner and made the evening that much more enjoyable and relaxing.
We started with cocktails. He had his usual dirty martini, I opted to try The Alchemist. We were both FLOORED by how good they were. Whoever is behind the bar knows their stuff; I've never had such a good cocktail in my life.
We followed up with an order of carpaccio, escargots, and crab arancini. The carpaccio was delightfully, melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The crab arancini is like if a hush puppy and blue crab had a baby and it is DELICIOUS. If you order it, make sure to dip it in the chili sauce! The escargots were fantastic. I have never had escargots, but have always wanted to try them. Bellwether set the bar; I will pit any other establishment's claim against them. 
Obviously, we ended with our entree order. BF ordered the diver scallops, I ordered the pork steak. The scallops were cooked to perfection, just the right amount of tenderness. The pork steak would make a true St. Louisan cry. So tender and juicy, with a tangy glaze that complimented the bed of broccoli, apple and jicama.
The meal was rounded out with glasses of champagne, on the house, to celebrate our anniversary. I will always come back to this establishment. The service and the food combined provide the perfect atmosphere to enjoy a beautiful evening out. Thank you to everyone who contributed to this perfect evening.",2021-01-31 01:11:27,350,1762,

I needed a prescription, and didn't actually need to do any other shopping. It was the first time using their Pharmacy so beforehand I set up my online account. It takes a little longer when it's a new Rx & I'd brought a book to pass the time while I waited rather than driving all the way home and back in the wet, windy weather. I strolled around also and every employee who saw me addressed me. ""Hello, how are you."" ""Do you need help finding anything"" etc. Very sincere and I have to say made it a pleasant wait. 
The only downside was when I went to the inside Starbucks as the girl was fixing the board behind the registers after seeing me standing there waiting. I stood there while she ignored me for a good 5 minutes. I really needed some coffee and a snack as my Dr's appt. had been early and I was hungry & in need of some sugar & caffeine. I'd been waiting about an hour by then. I finally walked off without saying anything. She totally ignored me. But I don't hold it against the store. 
Safeway has the best run pharmacy I've seen in a decade. The Pharmacist was busy and very professional, but he stopped when asked by the clerk on the procedure for inputing some proper information into my account page. He had a way about him that induces teamwork and standards. Not anything like the Pharmacy  (which shall remain nameless) I'd been using for years. The clerk, who was very well spoken and friendly gave me the store discount for my medicine. They text when your Rx is ready, which is another plus. No listening for your name on the loudspeaker. I will use their Pharmacy from now on for more reasons than what I've mentioned here. I'm going to start shopping there. The bathrooms were spotless. The entire establishment was spotless. The store is also easy to find and park and the travel is expedient for me. Thanks again to the Pharmacy Staff in particular. I'm looking forward to a long business relationship there.
P.S. As I was leaving a family came in with 2 children, both older than 10 with 2 grown women with absolutely no masks. I was tempted to tell someone, but I was tired and after the wait & being ignored for the caffeine boost I'd needed at Starbucks, I simply wanted to go home.  I'd seen nothing but an exceptionally well run business so I assumed one of the security cameras or a member of staff noticed. I felt assured from spending time there that someone had been assigned to look for such outward acts of dismissal for the law, and for such an obscene arrogance toward any of those in danger of the Pandemic, & with absolutely no regard for any who might be in danger of being exposed including themselves and their CHILDREN. In fact, everyone in the store. I should've alerted a store employee but hope someone was dispatched to enforce the LAW. Several times I've seen employees in businesses step in when anyone so much as had their mask on improperly. Thank You.",2021-01-05 04:29:00,629,3027,
5RhMOvaJLbdGVWbSX90XFg,Zvkn-pd2lNFHrADdWDcb0w,TNZ9ES8B2umWgtLnA4YTQA,1,2,0,0,"I'm going to leave my honest opinion on my experience with Emma. It may make people mad but not everyone has a good experience.

I messaged Emma on Dec 9th on Facebook for my tattoo, she initially got back to me quickly. She said she loved the idea and just needed to know how big I wanted it to quote me. I very clearly stated I wanted an exploding heart no bigger than 2.5 inches or so on my butt. I NEVER received a quote.

I asked if I should call the shop to schedule my appointment and she said she would do it for me. Communication was still good, she was getting back to me within a couple of days. She stated she had a Tuesday January 5 open at Noon and 3. I requested the noon appointment.

Assuming she booked me, we talked about deposit, which I brought up. She said it would be $50 and I could directly send it to her personal account on cash app, PayPal or vemo. I stated PayPal would work and she gave me her email address.

The email she provided had a typo, I sent the payment within 2 days and it just sat telling me that Emma Holmes needed to create an account. I messaged her to let her know I sent it and there was an issue and within a couple of days I had her correct email and made my deposit.

Then.....crickets. On Dec 21 she saw my message saying I sent the payment. She never replied to confirm my deposit or my appointment or give me a quote. She just stopped replying all together. I gave her the benefit knowing it was the holidays and I could see she was busy from her ig. The last time we spoke was Dec 21.

I was patient, I messaged her Monday Jan 4 to confirm and get a quote and NO REPLY!!! Then I contaced her again twice on Tues Jan 5, the day of my appointment to confirm and still no reply.

This is when I get mad. I got to the shop at noon, like she told me on the message she sent me. I ring the bell and no one answers. I wait outside for about 10 minutes. When she gets to the shop she asks me who I am and who I was here to see. I told her I'm Melanie and I'm her to see you. She chuckled and said that she had a problem she already had someone there for a noon appointment and must of double booked. We go inside and the person is already sitting in the shop waiting.

I said to her that she is not good at responding to messages and she blew it off and said stuff happens. She made it seem like she had no clue about my noon appointment or was really interested in doing my tat. Then after looking at the messages she had sent she looks at her phone and says to me oh yeah here you are I have you booked at 4:30 today.

First off my appointment was booked, or so I thought, for noon. So I agree to the 4:30 time slot. At almost 4:30 she messages me that she is running late and it will be 4:45 or 5. So I'm at the shop by that point so I wait in the car and I go to the door at 10 minutes till 5.

She opens the door and tells me that I can wait in my car for her to be ready. I was like huh and she says well I guess you could wait in here. I'm thinking I've waited all day at this point, I'm not waiting in my car. I should have forms to fill out etc to get ready. So I go tell her I'll wait inside. I felt like she didn't really want to be bothered.

I sit downstairs and wait for about 30 minutes. She pulls out my drawing and says what do you think of the size. I tell her it's bigger than what I wanted. I'm looking for sexy cute and not huge. I wanted no bigger than 2.5 inches. She says she can shrink it but it's not going to look good (I still don't have a price quote). I stand by that it's too big but I take her professional opinion and go against what I wanted (my mistake).

It it took about 30 minutes for her to do the tattoo. She says you paid me $50 already right? Yeah I paid her personally, not the shop. It will be an additional $130 today so $180. Serious, you didn't quote me after I asked multiple times. I never imagined that a very simple tat that only took 30 minutes to do would cost $180. I was there for 1 hr.

I'm left disrespected and overcharged. Very unprofessional treatment.",2021-01-06 16:39:01,932,4059,

My wife and I stopped here to get a McFlurry at the drive thru. We were greeted with a rushed attendant and a whole lot of background noise. So much so that they we couldn't understand each other at first. 
Now on our part, we ordered a peanut butter cup McFlurry that isn't on the menu. That's our fault. However, the attendant was very rude in telling us that they didn't have that and decided that we were getting an M&M one instead. She then rushed us into finishing the order. 
We make it to the window and we see many of the employees wearing their masks improperly and barely covering their faces as they were moving about and handling our McFlurry. On top of that, they initially made an Oreo one which they realized before serving us. 
Lastly when I went to pay, there were no words uttered than the price which wasn't really said in the friendliest tone.  When getting my change back, it was pretty much thrown at me with disregard and a couple of coins fell in the process. No apology or recognition of the sloppy exchange that had just occurred. 
After all of this, and disappointed, we did not eat the McFlurry as we weren't comfortable with what we just saw and experienced. Nor did we go back for a refund because we did just didn't want that headache. 
If you've made it this far, I don't think I need to stress any more how much you shouldn't go here. Not just from a customer service stand point, but simple ""hello's"" and ""thank you's"" are kind of expected I think in every day interaction. I'll be honest and say that I wouldn't have even have left a review if I wasn't so offended. I just need people to know what a headache this place gives me. 
I just can't believe that this location still remains open as it really does put a tarnish on this brand. I hope the franchisers make some managerial and staff changes here.",2021-01-09 02:42:48,440,2060,

Here's where it went wrong:

I booked Antwan for a $60 Benchmark cut (which includes -Relaxing spa services - paraffin hand dip, scalp massage, pressure point facial massage, steamed towel and stress-relieving hand massage
 And -Your experience is completed with our finishing touch styling and a demonstration on how to best style your hair every day). When I showed up, they gave me a different stylist, who I didn't even know. 

This stylist washed my hair and did the ""scalp massage"" as quickly and roughly as possible. I didn't receive any of the other services I booked. I didn't ask while I was there as I was just ready to get the haircut over with at that point. 

I wear glasses, so I couldn't see during my hair cut. When I got home I saw that she took the right side of my hairline back almost an inch for no good reason. The left side was untouched. Part of my neck still had hair. (The top of the hair and the fade did look good.) I was so disappointed and now my hair looks goofy as hell. 

They ended up only doing the basic $45 express cut for me when that was not what I had booked the appointment for. 

I am a student who really wanted to treat themselves after a stressful time. Boardroom really dropped the ball and left me not wanting to ever come back.",2021-01-28 20:08:38,308,1449,

I feel so badly for the owners of Hiccups & Churrholic. They seemed to be on pace to open this restaurant nearly a year ago, right before this little thing called COVID-19 showed up in our lives. The trials and tribulations of small business owners in this time cannot be overstated and these folks are a prime example of that. I cannot even begin to understand what they have been through in the last year, but fortunately we live in a state that is doing its best to help businesses make the best of a bad situation. 

To add to that, I visited on the third day Hiccups opened and it was packed. After all they've been through, I couldn't be happier to see it! But I was happy that I'd called in ahead, as my food was ready when I arrived.

The thing my wife and I knew would be the #1 priority on our list were the garlic noodles. We added the shaken beef as our protein. We had garlic noodles in Hawaii a few years ago that we still talk about to this day, so we were pumped to see them on the menu. Unfortunately, they didn't quite taste like that, but they did taste like really delicious lo mein noodles. We wished the veggies were sliced a little thinner, but overall, it was an enjoyable dish.

We also ordered popcorn chicken with fried rice. The rice was as good as it gets. The popcorn chicken was quite tasty and plentiful. You get a ton of bang for your buck with this dish!

I actually think my favorite thing I ate were the cajun wings. I will definitely be ordering them again!

I also loved my taro smoothie with boba. They actually ran out of regular boba, so I had to replace it with crystal boba, which I'd never had before, but really liked it! It was a bit more chewy than regular boba... I might have to order that on purpose next time!

And we finished it off with a coconut chocolate churro, which was wonderful.

All in all, we will probably come here quite frequently, especially for boba and other treats. Kudos to these business owners for persevering and making Carrollwood just a little bit cooler than it was before January 8, 2021.",2021-01-12 12:53:35,462,2162,

It was on her radar and she decided to book an outdoor reservation in January.  Why not?  We got a reservation and brought into the back patio, where there was a tent and heaters. 

We arrived to what seems to be a local spot.  Possibly a stop for Septa workers, because I think a few of the people in the back all worked there.  We ordered some meatballs as an appetizer, something I always have to get.  Pretty good, served with some ricotta cheese.  The plate was pretty big, but we ate two meatballs each and all of the cheese.  Off to a good start.

My wife ordered taglioline with black truffle, Pear & cheese fiocchi for the table, and I went with Murph's pasta.  If you don't know, this is an Irish Pub, serving Italian food, so why not get southing that marries the two?  Pasta with Murphy's Irish Stout.  Bacon, an entire block's worth of shaved parmigiana and a perfect amount of spice.  This was so different and such a great meal.  The Pear & Cheese fiocchi had great flavor, but I feel it would be way too much as a meal.  I think I said its better than my pasta dish, but I'd rather eat more of my pasta dish...  Does that make sense?  

Service was alright, not really attentive.  We were outside though...  I saw the Yelp Philly instagram page and a few of you tagged Murph's as a place you miss.  I get why.  If I lived in the area, this would be a place we'd stop by more regularly.  Big portions for a decent price.  Cash only though.  I think they have an ATM though...",2021-01-20 02:21:42,342,1547,

I had a bad experience the first time, but decided to give it another chance before writing a review and making a final decision on this place. The first time I got a tuna and a latte. Customer service was mediocre and it took forever to get my latte. I had to walk back up and ask for it. The latte basically just tastes like milk. It was just not good at all. The tuna had noooo flavor! So bland and boring. I was not a fan at all. And I love tuna.

So this time I was really craving a Cuban. We had just tried going to a highly raved about Cuban spot, but it was closed. So I figured we could try 51st deli again and I could try their Cuban. I ordered that and a latte again. Once again, the latte was just horrible. Tastes like milk. Literally such a bad coffee. I get my sandwich and immediately noticed it looked nothing like the pictures I saw from them. It didn't look like a Cuban at all. My first bite was almost inedible. The pulled pork stuff on it was so hard and it would not tear apart for the life of me. So I just stuffed the whole bite in my mouth since it wouldn't tear and tried to chew this hard chewy pork for a lifetime. I had other bites that were mostly ham and they were much better and easier to chew. But overall the sandwich was just a major letdown. Definitely does not qualify as a Cuban AT ALL!

Needless to say, I've given this place all the chances I can give. It's overpriced for the quality you get. Not worth it at all. I'll take my coins elsewhere.",2021-01-03 20:13:09,355,1570,

It was literally the weirdest and yet most wonderful experience I've had this year. I swear to god all of this is true, it sounds so bizarre but this was my actual experience. Let me tell you:

I drive to the shop, get out of my car, and ring the doorbell from outside on the sidewalk since the door is locked. No answer. A second later, I hear a window opening behind me and a bell rings. I turn around, and there in the window on the side of the building is a tall man with gorgeous painted nails asking to see my laptop. Slightly bewildered, I step up to the window and hand him my laptop. I explain the problem (my battery has an error message and says ""Service Recommended""). The man tells me, ""Just a second"" and skips into another room out of my line of vision. When he comes back, he is holding a laptop similar to mine which has clearly exploded. The keyboard is wonky and the mousepad has engorged so much that I can see the inside of the computer. He tells me, ""This is what will happen if we don't fix your laptop."" Mind you, if I wasn't already sold on the service, I definitely am now. ""Okay,"" I say, and he explains to me what he needs to fix and how much it will cost. It's all very quick and done in about 5 minutes.

48 hours later I receive a phone call. The man on the line says, ""Your laptop has exploded, it destroyed an apartment building, killed 3 children, and even started a human rights hashtag campaign on social media. Anyways, we fixed it and you can pick it up now."" Damn, I hate it when that happens, I think to myself. I drive on over to pick up my laptop, the man in the window hands it back to me and says he was able to fix both the battery problem AND my broken USB port at no extra charge! He then asks me to come inside to pay. He walks over to the door (the one that was locked originally) and tells me to get some hand sanitizer (hanging on the wall next to the door--this was COVID times) and then doesn't unlock the door until he sees me use the hand sanitizer. Great, I appreciate the consumer safety precautions. I notice he's wearing extremely glittery shoes, which look fabulous. When he lets me in, I pay with my card, sign, put my laptop away in my bag, and turn to leave. He then asks me what kind of phone I have. I show him my iPhone 8. He says, ""Just a second!"" and runs to the back room, which I can see now through a window. There, he grabs a small box and reaches down to his DOG (who is just chilling back there) and tells the dog, ""Bring this to the nice person!"" Then an ADORABLE dog comes sauntering up to me with a Tempered Glass Screen Protector 2-pack in its mouth. I take the complimentary 2-pack and give the dog lots of pets. The man returns and says ""Thanks for coming, see you later!"" and I head back out to my car with my good-as-new computer, the free screen protectors, and a newfound understanding of Above and Beyond customer service.

I am literally so confused. And so happy.",2021-01-28 00:04:47,687,3016,

So I had the very misfortune of going here. Twice! The first time I was greeted very oddly as if I shouldn't be there, maybe it was the way I looked, but nevertheless I needed to get dental work done and this was the closest place. I found it weird that a dental place only has five reviews but had a talk with my aching tooth, and it won the argument. I came here to get a root canal, and a teeth cleaning. Then was told I have to do a first time exam, I already had one done and said no let's just work on the tooth. They got passive aggressive about it but did it anyways. After waiting for an hour she told me I have to go to a specialist. She doesn't do root canal there. Really? I asked if I was just aching from the pain and misheard her. Nope. They first recommended a place that didn't take my insurance at all (over 1000), then I had to find another one. So I went to Sierra Endodontics (160 total). Very nice people! Do recommend! Then they told me they would contact me a week after, they waited almost a month and set my date weeks later. So the day of my appointment came at 7 AM. They told me my appointment was canceled because they didn't get confirmation. I was at work the times they called. So I set another appointment for the following month! A few days before my appointment the called me and told me I have to pay over 300 dollars by the end of the day or my appointment would be canceled. I didn't get out till 6 so I thought my appointment was canceled. She then called me the day of my appointment and said why I'm not there? ""Umm you told me my appointment would be canceled by end of day if I didn't pay."" She then told me, yeah well now we really can't take you in until you prepaid the appointment? So a lie?

After dropping off my car, was told the oil change wouldn't be that long, but the factory recall would take longer to finish and was given an estimated time of 2 hours to complete servicing my car.

 I am writing this letter following my dissatisfying experience at your restaurant Boil Seafood House. I'd like to start by saying thank you for bringing a unique twist to New Orleans authentic seafood. To begin, here's a little transparency about both myself and my 
partner my significant other has worked in customer service for nearly a decade and has been a store manager for roughly five years with a master's in business administration. I has been a senior commercial real estate agent at NAI Latter & Blum for more than twenty years. We both hold a tenure status in customer service and understand what it takes to exemplify impeccable service to customers/clients.

On Wednesday, January 20, 2021, my partner and I chose to visit your restaurant for the first 
time after visiting the website which displayed what I thought would be a tasteful experience in a 
great environment with a pleasant staff. Unfortunately, that was not the case the service was 
repulsive and disappointing. Our server JoJo delivered our food to the table and vanished the 
entire time we completed our meal. We did not receive the condiments we were promised he'd 
bring; my partner was forced to step away from his chair to ask a barmaid to kindly refill his 
drink. Even more disgraceful we had to walk down the stairs to request that the hostess locate 
our server to simply cover our tab.
It was such a disappointment I asked to speak with the manager on duty for that night, the 
manager Gabriel came downstairs to speak with us about our experience. Speaking with Gabriel 
resembled speaking with an amateur first-year waiter he did not resolve the issue. Gabriel 
appeared to be untrained and showed absolutely no empathy to us as paying customers. Gabriel 
not once apologized for the service or offered any compensation. Gabriel was completely 
incompetent in running your establishment. I called the following day to speak with someone at 
the top of the hierarchy, however Gabriel wouldn't permit me to speak with any other person. I 
was appalled at such an awful experience. I hope you look into this matter and make sure such an 
incident is not repeated. I would also recommend training with your staff. I do not have the 
desire to visit your establishment again with such a distasteful experience on both the waiter and 
manager. I hope in the future the quality of your restaurant's service improves. I'd like in the 
event that you call me so I can further explain this matter",2021-01-24 04:57:34,460,2497,

I've been living in the area for a year and anytime I ordered Hungry Howie's, there was one thing wrong or another. If I ordered butter cheese and butter garlic crust, the whole thing was soaked and hardly edible. If I ordered small pizzas, there were hardly any toppings. If I ordered no sauce, they put on so much it over dominated the other flavors. If I ordered lightly baked, it was hardly cooked at all. I thought maybe my orders were too high maintenance and they were having a laugh at me, even though there had never been issues in the past (isn't that why they offer those options?!) so I tried making more ""normal"" orders and they were still constantly low quality. I thought ""hey, maybe we're all a little in over our heads with the pandemic right now and I should just be understanding, it can't be easy working food service right now.""

I hopped on Yelp, and it sure doesn't look like these problems just started this year. So I picked the other location that delivers to my house, and oh my god, I finally had good Hungry Howie's again!! AAAUGH! IT'S BEEN OVER A YEAR!!

I liked how the courtyard had heat lamps and was well lit with colorful Christmas string lights).

Before dinner, we shared a cheese plate. It was nice to pick your own cheeses from the refrigerator and the staff will jazz up the cheese plate with orange marmalade, cranberry and nuts, olives, pickled vegetables, and bread. We enjoyed the Vandersterre and Landaff cheese with a bottle of Le Papillon D'Orphee red wine. 

For dinner, we shared several plates including (1) Roasted Beets, (2)  Bacon Wrapped Dates, (3) Grilled Vegetables, (4) Mussels, (5) Roasted Butternut Squash Risotto, (6) Smoked Catfish Dip, (7) Grilled Hanger Steak, (8) Roasted Carrot Soup, and (9) Confit Chicken Leg.

The Roasted Beets consisted of spring mix, candy cane beets, squash, satsuma (mandarin orange), and pepitas lightly tossed in a burnt orange vinaigrette.

The Bacon Wrapped Dates were stuffed with cheese and chorizo and served in a creamy tomato sauce. The chorizo added a spicy kick to this sweet and savory appetizer. 

The Grilled Vegetables was not what we expected. It resembled a carrot top and consisted of spring roll made of vegetables and served in a pesto sauce.

The Mussels consisted of PEI mussels steamed with wine and herbs and served with grilled bread. 

The Roasted Butternut Squash Risotto consisted of risotto cooked with roasted butternut squash, topped with roasted crushed pepitas, and finished with a dollop of mascarpone and fresh sage. The roasted pepitas added texture to risotto. It was rich and creamy.

The Smoked Catfish Dip was served chilled and topped with trout roe, radish, and micro greens and served with lavish crackers. It was one of my favorite items.

The Grilled Hanger Steak was served in port reduction with cauliflower gratin and garnished with a handful of EVOO tossed arugula. I liked how tender the steak was. I would have never thought of serving steak with a cauliflower gratin but it complimented the dish nicely.

The Roasted Carrot Soup was garnished with a dollop of mascarpone, a line of roasted pepitas, and sumac. I liked the thickness and taste of the soup.

The Confit Chicken Leg consisted a chicken leg cooked in chicken fat with  herbed mushroom, shallot, and chorizo. I liked the combination of flavors.",2021-01-07 02:49:56,489,2518,

If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I brought my mother last year and felt a bit uncomfortable with the service. I honestly thought it was the waitress having a bad day. I really enjoyed the salmon so, I convinced my husband and friends to drive 2 hours and have lunch here today. The head hostess treated us terrible. She was yelling at us saying ""people, we are in the middle of a pandemic, move, go and stay in your car! "" There were other people trying to get a table as well and she didn't yell at them. The only difference was that they had blue eyes and light skin. A young man cleaning the tables felt bad. He came and sat us down and got us menus. He was the only one that was kind to us. He apologized and said everyone has been here for many years, they are tired and have their own way of doing things. He said I'm new so I see and do things differently. We were sitting there for about 15 minutes without being acknowledged. All the waitress just passed by our table and didnt even look at us. When I asked one of the waitresses she said ""we are no longer sitting anyone for lunch, the manager said not to serve you, I dont know who gave you menus, you need to leave"" I felt so humiliated when I saw that everyone was looking at us. We had to get up and leave. So disappointed that there is so much hatred in this world. As we were leaving a couple was being seated in a table big enough for 6",2021-01-02 19:42:24,316,1429,
zmCnQZLETcFktcra5VSAXA,3NW7-EEiPu9s-PW-toTg2Q,xukkot9U57iKRGLZbBi7-Q,1,2,0,0,"I saw an ad for $25 full sets at the lash lounge and thought to give it a try since they had 4 out of 5 stars and decent Yelp reviews. I should have known after having a bad first impression when booking the appointment that this was going to be a disaster... the woman who booked my appointment over the phone (didn't ever say her name) was unprofessional, in that she seemed pre occupied with other co-workers giggling and repeating questions using verbiage like ""what did you say?"" Etc...
I arrived to my appointment 10 minutes early per the Lash Lounge requirements and was greeted by a different receptionist who seemed friendly and eager to help me get signed in. Paperwork was brief and on the bottom half had detailed information for the lash tech to fill out (including lash length, curl, amount of boldness etc). I was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the facility. 
Jazmyn was my lash tech who welcomed me on time and acted in a friendly manner throughout our appointment. Throughout our 3+ hour appointment...
Let me back track a minute - some of the questions I was asked were:
1. Do you want a classic or volume fill? I answered volume. 
2. Do you want bold , full or both? I asked Jazmyn to clarify and she said it mean if I wanted them long and full or one and the other...I answered both! 
3. Do you want C or D curl (C is more subtle)? I answered D. 

I am trying to prove I was going for an extreme/dramatic look as I've had in the past, with the understanding I booked this appointment with the knowledge my lash tech was still in training and may not have the experience to produce what a seasoned lash artist could. I clearly stated in my text response this was no problem, that I expected the volume set to turn out more as a ""hybrid"" but with fills and time it would slowly build to volume. 
Again, Jazmyn remained friendly and gently throughout our appointment but with my eyes closed and no awareness of what hour it was, I became a bit anxious and uncomfortable after laying still for so long. So I asked her about how much time was left and she replied ""Well we aren't finished yet and we have you booked 2pm-5pm and it's 5pm now...""
I asked her if I could use the restroom so she took the eye pads off and let me have a potty break. After using the restroom and washing my hands, I was in COMPLETE SHOCK looking at my lashes in the mirror...after 3 hours there was no difference! How could this be?! I was literally...speechless.
I came back to the table to lay back down and let Jazmyn finish but she explained to her the full look it was going to take another 2 hours..I became a bit frustrated not having this communicated to be from the get go. I was told it would be a 2-3hr appt. One manager came over and became defensive over Jazmyn stating ""well she is just learning and you agreed to be a model"", she stated this in a very unfriendly defensive tone when I was simply asking to clarify why my lashes looked the way they did after 3 hours and if 2 more hours would make anymore of a difference...
Another manager came over (my eyes were closed as I was laying down) letting Jazmyn know the appointment time is over and yes she can continue only if I'm comfortable with it.
At this point the staff was giving off an unwelcoming and unfriendly vibe without a clear explanation if laying there uncomfortably for another 2 hours would make me satisfied with a ""volume"" looking lash set. 
I decided it was time to call it quits as I didn't appreciate the way I was treated or the absurd amount of time spent on my lashes only to walk away looking the same yet money out of my pocket and a day wasted. 
When checking out at the front, the receptionist asked how my service was and I explained to her my frustrations. Her response was ""ok would you like to book an appointment for your refill follow up?"" I was even more behooved at their lack of customer service and manners to had what had happened. 
Jazmyn remained friendly and is still in training which is why I tipped her the full service amount of $25 on top of the $25 fee. 
The staff and lounge itself I would never go back to.",2021-01-15 03:52:12,860,4127,

Well that was a mistake. I arrived realized there was no curbside so. Went in to the front desk and asked them (there were 3 people) where to go for pickup. I was directed to the counter doing desserts at the front and stood in a line snaking back passed tables. I had a face shield but people eating at the tables didn't. I finally got to the front of the line to be told oh no you have to go to the back of the restaurant to pick up food. Where I asked and I was just pointed at the back. I wasn't happy it had taken me 15minutes or more to get to the front of the line. I walked right through the restaurant to the back and still had to ask 2 waiters where to go. Only to find it nestled into the far right hand corner. Why the hell they don't have signs to direct people into the door at the back of the restaurant and have signs of where to go I just can't understand. It's Covid19 no one wants to be in the restaurant let alone walk the entire length of it in the middle of a surge. Not even the door dash guys/girls. The restaurant was also full as it could be I guess as it was NY Eve if I had of known I'd have gotten it delivered. Also it was cold by the time we got home. LIFT YOUR GAME FOR PICK UP PEOPLE
Thank you Cheesecake for sending me to your questions site (not even a link) I see you do have curbside pickup that goes to the car. I unfortunately chose to go through Door Dash and then decided on pickup so wasn't aware. However your staff should be and could've directed me back to my car and had the food delivered to the car if they had been on their toes as I said you had not one but 3 people on the front desk that night and no one too concerned about giving the right information. My suggestion to you would be have a large sign outside saying Curbside with a number to ring like California Pizza right next door to you.

The food occasionally gets messed up (which sucks during COVID bc you can't immediately get it resolved like you could if you ate there), but a few screw-ups are to be expected in any food establishments. What makes this place horrible is the ""service."" This isn't the first time an employee at this location lacked civility, but the employee working the drive-through on a recent Thursday night took the cake. Not just bad service, she SCREAMED at my 70 year old mother, and told her to get out of line bc the employee couldn't find our order number, which we read off to her. TO GO WHERE?!?? They locked the doors (at 8:00 at night)! We used the app and had an order number. She absolutely refused to even look at our order number. We left, and went to Deja Vu.

I've worked at the lowest levels of fast food, to actually owning a fast food place here in SB for nearly a decade. I am definitely NOT a ""the customer is always right"" type of person. And I definitely understand that you never know what someone is going through, so I could just chalk it up to a bad day. 

But this was so over the top ... (and, as I said, other employees have acted similarly, just not this extreme).


TO THE MANAGER/OWNER: what's worse than having this employee(s)? Knowing full well you have problems (judging by the Yelp reviews, this isn't the first time someone complained), and you have chosen to do nothing about it. You either don't read the reviews, or you don't care, and I don't know what frustrates me more.

The next day, I just really wanted another burger after melanoma surgery. Yep, we got on the freeway to Carl's Jr., even though Jack in the Box is literally a two minute commute from my front door if you hit every red light.

1st visit around 7am with just 2 other customers, and today shortly before 11am, when chaos ruled ...

consistency did not exist at ""Slim Goodies Diner"" (for me anyway) ..,

really great service 1st time, but bad service this time ...

the 2 slices of bacon were chewey, cold & under-cooked 1st time, with the 2nd time 3 slices of perfectly-cooked crispy bacon ...

one constant was the hash browns were cold both times, although the 1st hash browns were ""swimming"" in grease, but no visible grease the 2nd time ...

my over-easy eggs were over-cooked 1st time (hard yolk) & under-cooked 2nd time (with clear stuff running out of eggs when I cut them) ...

both servers did not bring me my biscuit/toast until I had eaten a good portion of my breakfasts ...

coffee & water re-fills were right on 1st time, but 2nd time I sat with 2 ""empty"" liquid holders for an ""extended"" period (& it was not because of chaos, as I could see my server standing around) ...

prices are high based on food quality & service $$$$

I do like the counter-seating snd outdoor patio seating options though

I was suuuuuuuper excited because we love the S Virginia location but it is a few miles drive. This location is less than 1-mile from our home. A little after returning from the park we placed a pickup order for combo #3. We were told it'll take about 25-minutes. The food was ready when we arrived which was about 5-minutes after their estimated time.

When we got home, my boyfriend was immediately disapppointed because the meat in the slider was a lot smaller compared to what we are used to from the other location. He also mentioned that the chicken had more ""grizzler"" than the chicken. And the tender was also small. We could normally share a combo plate because the portion were amazing, but not this time. I took a couple of bites of the small tender just to taste and it was just okay--it was dry and actually cold. I wonder if they cooked the chicken in advance, freeze them, then refry. Who knows! All we know is our order tonight was not even close to the quality from the original location. My boyfriend even said it ""has to be the worst chicken sandwich I've ever had"". We are deeply disappointed that this location didn't live up to the standard of the original location.

This is a problem for me because so many black women have died due to medical schools teaching the students that black women don't feel pain as much as other races. Or they automatically believe we're lying. OR they're just flat out racist pieces of shit. That's disgusting and inhumane to not treat someone because of your own ignorance. I could've died that day.

SECOND, I have called the mental health clinic multiple times during this pandemic to schedule a phone session and every single time I was told I would  get a call back and never did. Of course there's a crisis line but no one wants to keep explaining the situation to a DIFFERENT person every time. Seriously, y'all need to get your shit together.

I booked my stay through priceline. com and decided to stay here because of the proximity of the location and because of the good service received the last time I stayed here a couple of years ago five years to be exact., I ordered a king junior suite, I wanted  a lot of space since it was just me and my boyfriend. We arrived  like at 8pm that night because we had drove directly to a dinner show in Orlando. We checked in with no problems and was given a room in the third floor.  The room was spacious and everything was clean.  We took a shower and noticed that the hot water was warm and it didn't get hot, but we made nothing of it. The next day we were scheduled to go to Dade City and we woke up a little early and my boyfriend had gotten in the shower and he called me screaming saying that there was no hot water. At first, I thought he was joking and when I opened the faucet for hot water it was freezing cold, mind you it was 40 something degrees outside. 

I immediately contacted the front desk and spoke to Tammy and advised her about our situation and she replied, ""Everyone  must be taking a shower and there is nothing I can do.""  I said to her, I've never heard of that nonsense. I immediately called IHG corporate number and they issued me a case number and they called the front desk and spoke to Tammy to see what was the issue. I also called priceline. com and the also spoke to Tammy  and Priceline was able to refund me for one night.  We ended up taking a VERY COLD SHOWER, which was horrible. We came down stairs and Tammy apologized for the cold water, but I had advised her that something should have been said when we had checked in that night.  They were trying to get someone from plumbing to fix the issue.  When we arrived later that night, the hot water issue was resolved. 

Due to the pandemic, I also saw that the hotel was no longer serving HOT breakfast. They had the following:
cereal
muffuns
danishes
yougurt
orange juice
apple juice
You have to request it from the front desk and placed in a brown bag before departing the hotel.

Update to Richards response 1-16-2020 
Hi Richard I did not falsely accuse your staff of stealing. They did straight up take the phone off the table. Like you said it was hidden in a napkin so it was ""obvious to see"". Yet your staff still took the phone off the table. They knew we weren't done eating nor had they seen the check dropped. I dont know anyone who can eat a six course meal in 30 minutes as thats how long it took your staff to steal my phone. On the other hand when your staff decides to talk badly about a table they should do it in Back of House not in front of the customers. We're ""sorry"" the ""trouble table"" quote from the manager on duty that night was the trouble table after the fact. Also as the owner you sat on your ASS at the bar and didn't say anything.

The combo came with 2 eggs (any style) and your choice of 2 bacon or sausage (links or patties). Im usually just a plain Jane--I always order plain french toast but this time I ordered the glaze and so glad I did! It was definitely filling and delicious and would order this again!

2. Southern Belle Biscuits & Gravy: comes with southern fried chicken, cheese, a biscuit, and of course gravy (we asked for ours on the side). If you like savory, this dish is definitely it! O usually don't like a biscuits and gravy but this dish was delicious! Also very filling as the portions are a decent size! Definitely recommend!

3. Kid's 2 pancakes, 1 egg (any style), and your house of 1 bacon or sausage. We asked for chocolate chip pancakes, scrambled egg, and bacon. The portions on this plate was definitely for a big kid and it only cost $4.99! The pancakes are exactly the way we like them! Light and fluffy with crispy edges! Would definitely reorder this in the future! 

For drinks we ordered a hot coffee, iced coffee, and 2 kids apple juices. 

Staff/Service: we arrived around 1100 and from the outside, it didn't look like anyone was in there but when we went inside, the place was pretty busy! Busy is a great sign! As soon as we got in, we were greeted by a staff member and only waited about 5 minutes before we were seated. Our waitress's name was Violet. She was super sweet to us and our kids. As soon as we were seated, she asked what we wanted to drink. Her attentiveness on our table was on point; came by often to make sure she refilled our drinks. We did not wait too long for our food; actually came out pretty quickly! We will definitely be coming back! Thank you for the great experience! This is by far Our new favorite breakfast spot!

They have the most disorganized, obtuse pharmacy I've encountered. Terrible hours, prices & communication skills. Whomever answers the phone for this location tells you one thing and the pharmacy staff (one unkempt fellow in particular) tells you the opposite. This has happened on multiple occasions and we've only lived here for a few months. They have lost one of our hand carried life saving prescriptions (final straw), been contradictory on several other occasions, told my husband RX was ready last month & when he drove in from Red Rock and me a totally different story that day when I called, then another when I drove back the next morning. I used to like Walgreens in Oregon, but they've been substandard in Tucson area. Before this last run around I had already transferred all of my prescriptions to Fry's down the street. Now I've transferred all of my husband's. I think they must be getting ready to close this one down because they have another one nearby that has better hours, more helpful service. However, I won't be going to any, too much uncertainty with things that are too important. 
FYI, went back on the following day for heart meds, the young lady working the counter that day offered us an emergency supply that wasnt offered the day before (!) too bad it's so inconstant because she was helpful.

I thought what they did for the community during the pandemic was amazing. My son and I decided to ring in the new year there and overall had a great time, the waiters were amazing, the food was good. They have these heated benches and no one told me I could turn it off, when it became too hot, I put my sweatshirt down and enjoyed some drinks. The next morning I have 2 giant burns on my butt. How embarrassing right? Well, here I am 11 days later and in a great deal of pain. The burns blistered and now appear infected. I decided I should call so it wouldn't happen to anyone else and when the manager got on the line, she was rude and asked why didn't I turn it off? I told her I didn't know and she said that all her staff Says something about turning them on and off. Regardless, by the time I felt it, it was too late. She didn't want to take my name, she made me feel to blame when I simply wanted to warn them so it wouldn't happen to anyone else. So I'm laying here trying to muster up the courage to go bare my butt at urgent care tomorrow and since the manager could care less about my situation or the fact that I am burned, can't wear jeans and will scar, perhaps they will listen to my lawyer.

For the amount spent, you would expect at minimum good service. Unfortunately, that was not the case. We waited for 30 minutes to be sat outside, aka their ""courtyard"" that they just so happened to open up ""conveniently"" on OUR TURN and sat us out there first- away from everyone, in the cold and rain. We were not given an option to continue to wait for an inside spot OR for the rooftop which was our original plan. When asked once seated, the server (Brittany) BLUNTLY refused and said it was going to be a much longer wait for those. Our drinks and apps were delivered as it was raining and they proceeded to cover everyone else's tables that had JUST been seated prior to covering our table that already had food being exposed to rain.  

Our server was clearly busy - which is completely understandable given that it was NYE and I'd say were very understanding people. However, we were still upset that we hadn't been given the option to move inside and had to take it upon ourselves to discover what it would take to be sat inside, once seeking out the rooftop area that there was tons of open tables and the hostess informed us we could move up there and be sat immediately. 

Amy the hostess was amazing, she was basically the only one that showed professionalism and accommodation for us. Unfortunately she was then scolded at in front of us by the manager when assisting us and being asked about the situation. The suspected manager on duty was clearly annoyed by us and didn't seem to ACTUALLY care about our concerns. 

The food was good and came out hot.. however, purely based off of the awful service we originally had it was hard to enjoy it. We felt the drinks were considered ""doubles"" yet I felt like it was a way for them to rack up the bills with really no accountability on amount.

I have been battling lower back pain for two years and the only things that gives me any relief is massage. I went to another place and it just was not it. I was super excited about coming to Elements with the strong reviews and the specialization of each masseuse. 

First off, the place is clean, you take your temperature when you enter and everyone is masked the entire time. The masseuse was extremely sweet and nice. He had the pressure and depth that was advertised and really put in work. 
So what is the issue then?
I came in for lower back pain, was super specific on my entry form on the areas I needed done, went over it verbally down to giving exact areas that give me relief (it's been two years so I am very aware). I also explained that the PT I am seeing said to focus on the lower back, hip flexors and adductors (also on the form). He hit everything except those areas. He started on my back, did an amazing job on all the areas he touched and skipped why I came in. Before he flipped me over he did ask if there are any spots I'd like for him to hit again. I explained he never got to my problem spot. He graciously began massaging, of course began doing an amazing job and then it was over. I'd say maybe about 3-5 minutes on it. By then I had become really disheartened and frustrated. I flipped over he did my legs and feet. 
Ask me if I got even a dribble of oil of the hip flexors or adductors I explained from the beginning I needed and the PT had recommended... never touched. 

I went back and forth on whether to do a review because after my experience I believe the people that have gone there and had wonderful experiences truly did have wonderful massages. That said, it's hard to walk away happy when you literally give a map with specifics and it's completely missed.

At the end, they give you a care with feedback and recommendations. Would I go back at the rates, no. 160 for a 90 minute massage and have the main problem areas missed isn't worth it for me so the search continues...",2021-01-14 17:55:54,441,2078,

Maybe because it's in close proximity to the airport and you have weary hungry travelers who's best meal in the past 5 hours was a mini bag of crackers and a chocolate the size of a checker board square?? 

Anyway,  the service is lacking as well.  We were greeted by a slender college aged kid who we ended up seeing a total of 4 times while we dined there,  one of those 4 being the time he greeted us and another when my husband had to flag him down for the check. We were there for well over an hour. (My dear husband joked that he must have been busy next door at Maggianos flirting with the cute girls at the bar because he seemed distracted. )

The  ""complimentary"" rice and beans for the table is a complete joke.  It's a serving size fit for a toddler or small puppy.  The chicken enchiladas rancheras are reminiscent of the cheapie pot pies you can afford as a starving college kid.  The steak Street tacos were so bland that I questioned what kind of meat I was actually consuming.  And lastly the queso fundido appetizer was not fun or filling at all.  There were more vegetables than cheese.  Our bill was a whopping $95 bucks and we didn't even eat half of the food we ordered due to lack of taste and seasoning.  Oh and the fact our drinks were never refilled and we feared choking on less than mediocre Mexican.  Skip this place and either drop into the nearby Aldis for a cheapie chicken pot pie or head over to the nearby Roccos Tacos and endure the wait for significantly better Mexican eats and service.

Sis-in-law tells me they've placed an order that needs to be picked up so I volunteered.  She gives me direction to a place called I Love Salad, and I'm thinking what the hell did they order, a family-style garbage salad?  So I walk in the store and *clearly* the owners are Korean. (I can usually tell.. ;-)  Turns out the order was a bumch of kimbop rolls.

Unnecessary intro aside.. the rolls were acrually pretty damed good.  Kimbops, similar to something like futomaki (fat rolls) is not a luxurious food item.  It's equivalent of curbside hotdog stands you stop by on your walk back from school.  In the old days they were literally just that.  Auntie would roll up hundred-thirty-five rolls in the morning, wrap them in aluminum foil and sell them off to 3rd graders walking home after school at 70 cents a pop.  I guess where I'm getting at is that there's definitely a nostalgia-factor when it comes to it.  Don't give me wrong.  There'a a lot that could go wrong with this simple food that consist of rolled up rice with buncha veggies and protein.  It could be bland because rice wasn't seasoned correctly.  It could of already gone bad by the time you eat it because of the nature of mixing different ingredients together.  Way they're rolled also helps one's appetite.  Nobody wants to eat an exploded roll.  (It actually happens..)

Expert kimboppers have mastered their arts throughout time though.  It's a perfect picnic food because of its nature of highly compacted nutrients and its portability.  People will combine some funky ingredients to come up with their own twists, just like you do at your local Japanese places with their own town name with their rolls.  (Like I'm supposed to know what Buckeye roll is supposed to be...)  Done right though, some variations are to die for.

Anyway, what we had were spicy squid roll and bulgogi roll.  Gotta say, they were definitely one of the better ones I've had.  And Koreans have A LOT of them between your mom's, grandma's, aunt's, to your neighbors' and church deacon's wives'.  Sis-in-law tells me she had other menu items from them, but nothing comes close to their kimbop.  I'm okay with that as long as you're good at that one thing and you're consistent.

When the pandemic is over, I'll look forward to an on-site visit to try out a few other things, at the very least different variances of kimbop.

The clinic itself is fine, small, but fine, and the staff is nice. However, I will say that ever since COVID-19 the quality of service has dramatically fallen. Recent I rescued a kitten and brought her here for all her vaccines and we never showed up and where they were actually running on time. Spent almost 30min one day waiting outside in the cold with a 10 week kitten and I never have ever received a courtesy call letting me know they are behind which would be nice since most people who seem to come here are local. Yet, this isn't the real issue. The real issue is the pricing. It is absolutely ridiculous. They charge a ridiculous amount for little to no actual clinical work. All in all I'd say to get a kitten vaccine, basic vaccines and a check-up cost me over $600 between 3 visits. I was charged for a Vet Check-Up every time when all
My kitten needed on her 2nd and 3rd visit were simple shots. Yet, you never see the same Vet typically which gives them the automatic to charge you because your said animal
Is now seeing a ""new"" vet. This is probably why I noticed on my last visit the nurse brought me my statement before they even took my kitten, which I found odd, but I only can presume because the pricing is outrageous - especially when my kitten was in the vets office for no more than 15min and each time the bill was $200 on average. I'd imagine they've had many more unhappy customers. Absolutely ridiculous, but joke is on me. So please learn from my errors. I'd highly recommend any non-profit vet clinic or even going out of the city for your vet needs if they are basic and this place just wants your money. Nothing about this clinic is special so save yourself money and go else where.

Example, the estimate for my kitten to get fixed and microchipped comes to over $600 where PSPCA is $115.

Yet, I will say the Vets, or the one I've actually met and worked with in person, was truly great. She seemed knowledgeable and was pleasant to talk to. Additionally, the nurses are always bubbly even though they clearly are overworked and overwhelmed.",2021-01-04 10:14:29,447,2141,

I  have lived here for 5 1/2 years and have never had reason to complain about my upstairs neighbors (there have been 5 because no-one ever renews the lease with HSL).

+food is consistent and delicious
+clean, clean, clean
+friendly service at the register 

-service was slow.
It was a weekday night, at 5:30 and we ate inside. I didn't observe the drive thru to be busy either when we pulled in. Honestly, it shouldn't really matter because Portillo's is known to be fast...no matter what. Efficiency is synonymous with this place. The employee working at the dessert/beer area couldn't serve alcohol and had to call someone off the food area to pour my drink. A few minutes later, I saw the same employee from the dessert/beer area on the food line leaving other customers waiting....for beer he couldn't serve. Based on other experiences, the food line didn't seem to be working like a well-oiled machine.

-atmosphere was lacking.
I say this because the instant you walk into a Portillo's, you are transported into a mobster-type speakeasy. The decor was correct, yet it was lacking...know why? The music wasn't up loud enough, the employees didn't have that rhythm that conveys the energy you normally feel and no one rhymed my order. Grab that microphone and rhyme!!! Please! I know it's silly but I get a kick out of it and look forward to it. It's such a part of Portillo's, it's the personality and charm.

The real treat was being able to dine in and experience the food fresh out of the kitchen, at the perfect temp. Salads were crisp and fresh, well dressed. Caesar dressing is house made and perfect. Homemade bread is a bit dense for my liking, but I don't like bread all that much. Signature artichoke app was on point, and the sauce/dressing was out of this world. Clams in white wine sauce were on the smaller side, but i would've drank the juice if no one was watching. Branzino special was perfectly cooked and super tasty. But the absolute best was the gnocchi gorgonzola. They make it in house daily. They were fluffy pillowy dumplings. Like everything that you want a gnocchi to be, and rarely is. The cream sauce was buttery and cheesy without being heavy (but that could've been the case because I was already levitating from the taste and texture of the gnocchi itself?). The decor was warm and melodic Italian music played softly. Luigi, the owner and native Italian, visited our table after every dish was served to check on us. He was lovely. Two of his sons joined him and it was nice to see them enjoy a meal, and also to see what they ordered for themselves. Espresso after dinner was perfect, and two small pours of sambuca on the house were the perfect ending. The food was moderately priced but the quality and service were extremely high. It's a BYOB so all of our food plus two entrees to go was about the same price at a nice restaurant and paying for drinks.",2021-01-17 12:45:18,321,1555,

I was met at the door by s waitress who refused to allow me snd my guest to enter the restaurant without out masks ( which we all forgot). While required, the establishment did not provide Mack's so we had to scramble to find other establishments near by to provide them.  We then back in snd sent less than 2 feet to our table,

This aside, we were ready gif a great meal.  The same waitress then informed us that there was no wine or cocktails available despite the on line menu offerings.  The limited menu offered pasta and a few other items.  We selected a number of cheeses and nests for our antipasto and asked gif bread which took a long time to get.

I ordered the paparadelli with the chicken saltimbocca.  The other guests ordered pesto bucatini with chicken and paparadelli pasta Alfredo with shrimp.  In addition, I ordered the small Caesar's salad.

The salad arrived with literally 4 Romain leaves , a few crumbled croutons and a minuscule amount of flavorless dressing,  The saltimbocca was chopped up chicken with extreme salt soaked pasta.  It was completely inedible and I quickly asked for a replacement.  In the meantime, both Gherthe said their food was awful.  The pesto dish was tasteless and bland.  The Alfredo shrimp pasta was simply awful,  we had to ask for salt to try to get some taste in the food.  
My replacement dish was the Puttenesca pasta with chicken which was a little better but very amateurish st best.
There was no dessert menu but we told the cannoli was made in lace cookie snd the waitress had no idea if the filling was made with ricotta or not. After dealing dessert,  made the mistake of ordering an espresso. I can't put into words how dissatisfied I was with even that!  Simply horrid espresso.  

Thus was one of the worst meals I have had anywhere st any time.  

Maybe it will get better but it's going to take a complete overhaul in the kitchen and waitstaff.",2021-01-24 03:19:05,400,2044,

My stepdad was on a stretcher to this hospital after collapsing at the auto repair shop. The owner of the shop mentioned he was doing CPR and managed to get his heart pumping and breathing again while calling 911. Once we found out he was there from the auto repair manager, we made our way to see him, thinking he's going to be okay and the staff is doing everything to keep him alive. But the staff was extremely insensitive, bring up how she's seen more death than me and her uncle just died too like how is that supposed to make me feel better, then they desperately wanted his body for organ donation. Their mind was set on getting his organs to other people rushing my mom to sign over his body. I know they didn't care and didn't do a lot to save him either.

UPDATE: this hospital won't release his medical records to the family or tell us the cause of death. I believe they killed him by not providing him prompt care. Our family physician was a former staff and had horrible things to say about the place: understaff and tendency to be negligent leaving patient alone for hours on end. How was he revive from the auto shop (breathing with a pulse) to being dead in an ER room with a breathing tube filled with blood--that's how we saw him.

Also, people go to a restaurant or boutique 4 or 5 times a month, but they may only buy furniture every 4 or 5 years.  

I'm not saying that the negative reviews aren't valid.  I believe that they are.  I just don't think they tell the entire story.

So, I'm here to tell mine. 

I relocated to Indy from NY about 10 years ago.  I moved from a smaller rental to a home I bought here.  In NY, I had one sofa and chair that had lived it's life, so we left it by the curb on moving day.  (That's totally a thing.)

We walked into Value City and bought three living room suites, a dining room set, and a dinette set with some additional barstools. 

Delivery was timely and efficient.  In fact, one of the pieces I bought would not go into my basement!  The steps take a 45 degree turn and it wouldn't work at all.  The delivery guys were great.  They said,  ""We'll take it back and you can come in and pick something else.""  So, that's what we did and, when we arrived, one of the men on the delivery was getting ready to leave for day, but he walked through the store with us pointing out things that would work. 

Over 10 years later, almost everything is in great shape.  This well exceeded what we expected for the price. 

We are looking to replace some pieces and, naturally, went into Value City. 

We met up with a great person named Kelli.  She wasn't pushy and she showed us exactly what we asked for. 

I ended up ordering the furniture online.  It was a breeze.  It's supposed to be here in mid-February, but I won't be surprised it's late due to pandemic related supply chain issues.  

I'll up update my review after delivery and installation.  I'm hopeful for the same exceptional service.  I'll be candid if it is or of it isn't, but that's in the hands of Value City now.",2021-01-01 03:25:09,425,1912,

Stopped here with some friends and my two kids in the early evening after going to an event during the day. Great location, right on Dale Mabry less than a mile south of Raymond James Stadium. Parking was easy and ample. When you roll up, the place is attractive and welcoming.

Lots of outdoor seating and live music was a plus! The band playing was contemporary with no singer, but played recognizable songs that had people adding their own vocals.

The waitstaff was there to greet us and take drink orders as soon as we sat down. The menu selections were dynamic and there was something for everyone - even the kids! Salads, burgers, fresh fish, soups, prime rib, reubens and chicken, just to name a few. 

I got the cider tomahawk pork chop with smoked bacon cole slaw and the wildcat shrimp to start. Everything came out cooked perfectly and to temp.

If you like going to a dinner where the food becomes the main topic, this place is for you! Everyone at the table ate while ranting about how great everything was - yes, even a 6 and 8-year-old. The pork chop was seasoned perfectly and the coke slaw... let me just say I consider myself a bit of a 'slaw connoisseur'... was absolutely amazing! I actually had to get one to-go. All of our meals were nothing short of perfect.

I was with a friend and I ran to get some Keto bars.  My friend was waiting by the nuts until I returned and then we were going to checkout. Walking back I see a man with an orange vest pulling the cart, swerving in and out as my friend is running after him to catch up. He takes us to a new row of checkouts with two Cosco employees standing there with those scanner guns and one of them begins to scan my water. I thought, ""Wow they can scan all the groceries in the cart, what a great idea"". Boy that could not have been further from the truth! The second employee told me that I needed to start scanning my own groceries.  I could not believe this. Here I was standing in front of a self scanner scanning my own items and I was upset! Eight products in and already two or three items wouldn't scan. I asked the employee if she could scan the rest and she said, No, not allowed to but I can delete them all and you can go stand in line at another register"". I was so upset and frustrated by this point but told the girl I would continue. I certainly wanted to get this over with and leave. I spent nearly $300.00 scanning my own items. I was livid by the time I left. I was not given a choice as to weather I wanted to scan my own items or not. This over zealous man in the orange vest should have allowed me the choice. I went up to 2 managers next to the checkout and voiced my opinion to them. He could barely say, ""I'm sorry!"" It is so sad to see Costco, a company that I always felt had higher standards and always treated their patrons so well buy into self service scanning. I am older and always liked the assistance given at the checkout especially not having to lift heavy items. I just finishing reading that Cosco had great sales even during the pandemic, such a shame to lower your standards to save a few dollars and risk your reputation.",2021-01-18 16:57:49,420,1936,

The hostess was rude. She couldn't find our reservation despite being showed a confirmation email.  We were repeatedly told of our time limit for our table.  I understand that restaurants are suffering and need to turn tables but the delivery was unacceptable and we will not return. 

Even though NOLA had relaxed Covid restrictions, they refused to allow 7 people at our table so we had to split up. We were seated in the dark with no overhead string lights.  We had to use our flashlights to see anything.  

Everyone deals with Covid differently and their approach seems to be overboard caution. That's fine if that's their thing - but for us it was a bit extreme. I'm sure there are folks out there that would rave about the precautions and feel extra safe, this place will probably be a good choice if that's your main concern.  (Although the location was so sketchy that ""safe"" is relative.) 

The real problem was the food. We ordered a large cheese board with charcuterie, bread and butter and the dates. We had absolutely no input as to the type of cheese are charcuterie that would be on the tray, the menus provided no insight,  when it arrived we thought they had given us the ""small"" instead.  It was ridiculously small for the price, and very pedestrian. Nothing interesting or unique.  Wines are not offered by the glass so we were forced to buy 2 bottles. This is a wine bar- no by-the-glass option is absurd.  So, instead of having dinner there, we made reservations elsewhere and tried to enjoy our extremely expensive appetizer. 

Final straw: They charged my credit card three times for our food/drinks - causing my credit card to get turned off for a fraud alert.

However, customer service is so inconsistent, it's like they don't even care about it anymore. The last two times I went were so frustrating. 

I have an injured shoulder and waited for the cashier, who was a strong looking 20 something-year-old man, to load my bags into the cart. I asked for help out to the car too, since I had my one-year-old with me and after sitting in the shopping cart the entire trip I want her to be able to stretch her legs and walk around before getting in the car seat. It's a lot easier to keep track of a toddler when you aren't navigating a cart with one hand. 

The supervisor or whomever who was near him was visibly angry at me. She demanded to know if I wanted help to my car or to put the bags from the counter to my cart. Her tone of voice was actually angry. It was really strange. 

I told her that my shoulder was injured and asked if she could please put the bags in the shopping cart. I asked if that's something they can't do and she just ignored me with gritted teeth. I figured maybe there was something going on with her day. 

But then I went again and it was so unnecessarily unpleasant again. My first mistake was to get in line behind the short haired, middle aged lady who it seems runs the slowest line possible. If you shop here often you know who I'm talking about. She's usually at the first open register closest to the express line. She was chatting with the customer in front of me for a really long time about their personal lives. I glanced over to the other aisles and they were both moving so much faster. OK, so finally it's my turn. 

My one-year-old had a poop in her diaper, so I wanted to let her walk rather than sit in the shopping cart. And I wanted to be able to attend to that right away. So I asked her to ask someone to help bring groceries out to the car. All she said to me was ""Oh."" Then she complained loudly about it. 

She snd the woman who was to do the carry-out both talked about how I was a young person and not an old person and yet I needed help to the car. (Not to me, but to each other loud enough for me to hear.) What if I had cancer? What if I had some other condition they didn't know about? What if I just wanted help because I have a young child? 

Every time I go to Trader Joe's they automatically put the groceries from the counter to the cart and every time I ask for help to the car, they do it cheerfully. Like actually friendly and cheerful. What is with Whole Foods? 

And here's the thing, every time I go there are a couple of really nice workers who interact with. Today the baker, barista and man who greeted me when I entered from the garage were friendly and helpful.

The sales people were aggressive about selling us a Platinum Ultimate Plus Protection plan to protect both the exterior and interior finishes, at a cost of $1,285.  When we explained that it would be garage kept and not used that much, the salesman told us we really should have the coverage to protect the inside surfaces from damage, too.  We have only 4,500 miles on our RV, and we have kept it in our garage in order to avoid environmental damage.  However, the upholstery on the driver's seat, passenger seat, and couch is completely peeling off.  The result is a completely disgusting mess!  We can't even sit on it without the residue getting all over our clothes.  When we called the dealership, we were told to call the warranty people. When we contacted the warranty people, they were quick to quote us the protection as applying only to stains and tears, not peeling.  We researched the problem online and found MANY people experiencing the same problem since 2010, so we know Thor was aware of the problem.  We feel defrauded - and lied to.  When we call other dealers about possible selling the RV, one of their first questions is whether the seats are peeling.  It definitely is a widely known problem.  We are ashamed of how awful our RV looks and would like to have the upholstery redone using durable material.

We requested to be seated near each other (party of 7) and due to the CDC regulations we were told by the manger Dave/David that were weren't able to be seat at tables that were even near each other (meaning next to or adjacent) - after a few minutes went by the manger expressed that he would be able to seat us as close to each other as possible (which is the only reason why I've given two stars) 

Once we were seated and we ordered our food, the manager took a moment to visit our table to tell me that outside water isn't allowed in their establishment while pointing to my Acqua Panna. I kindly tucked away the water. 

Our food came out in a timely manner, however I was truly unpleased with how my AVOCADO TOAST came out. This is my typical go-to item due to my own personal dietary restrictions. I asked the waitress if it could be replaced and she instantly told me that she would need to have her manager come to the table. 
As the manager Dave/David came over to the table his energy was AGAIN unpleasant. He responded to me by stating that ""Once an order is placed and prepared the way that it appears in the menu, they do not remove items"".  NEVER have I ever had an establishment refuse to remove something from my plate it even replace it with something else. After I re-read him the description of the item and then explained to him that I was not expecting an AVOCADO SANDWICH or even for him to refuse to remove it from my bill.

As one of the most Keto friendly shops in Sparks, it guarantees that you won't be jockeying for shopping space with any vegetarians when salivating in front of the sparkling clear glass refrigerated cases. 

It can get busy and they are good about limiting the number of customers inside the store at any one time and enforcing a mask wearing requirement inside. This means that the queue can go out into the small parking lot during peak hours so beware that you don't become a human speed bump if you are not paying attention. I do appreciate that during COVID-19, they are really enforcing social distancing, masks, hand hygiene and limited interior capacity. While I love a great steak, I don't love it enough to risk the shopping experience turning it into my last meal. 

Upon entry, you are greeted by genuine meat-cutters complete with white coats and aprons. The craft of a trained butcher seems to be diminishing in society but this place is staffed by people that really seem to know their way around a cow. While it is not the cheapest meat around, you get some top grade choice beef that really looks like it isn't very short of prime for your money. I think this is a nice sweet spot of price for great product. No need to spend twice this much for prime graded meat when this will do for a lot less money. 

In addition to standard cuts of beef, they also have fresh pork and chicken but some other specialty items that I think are really worth it. Bone-in steaks that are tough to find in many regular grocery stores are not a problem here. They also have a nice selection of harder to find items that old-school cooks would definitely appreciate such as Scrapple, Marrow Bones, Ox-Tails, and even Headcheese! Couple that with fresh bacon, house made sausages, Marinated Tri-Tip, and even Chuckwagons (think sliced meatloaf wrapped in bacon) and it is hard to walk out of here with just 1 thing.

Nothing about the food was disappointing! We started with the grilled octopus and escargot and they were both delicious. I ordered the lamb chops, medium rare, and my husband ordered the lobster crepes with a side of fries. The lamb was cooked and seasoned perfectly and I am looking forward to the leftovers. Yum! My husband loved his lobster and crab crepes and said it was just the right amount of food. Now the fries...OMG. They may be the best cooked fries I've ever had. They were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and had just the right amount of salt. Another bright spot was the bartender, Michael. We chose a wine that they no longer had so he came to the table with a recommendation. I tasted it and it was too sweet for my taste so he helped us with another option. This time it was perfect. He was patient and helpful and we really appreciated the attention. 

Now for the experience. Take note...this review is being written during the COVID pandemic. I cannot remember the name of our server, but we ate on the top floor of the inn.

Her nose and mouth were exposed during the entire dinner. She was fun and knowledgeable, but the fact that she never put up her mask made me very uncomfortable. I watched her engage with other servers and employees and no one said anything to her.

She was very attentive in the beginning, but after we finished our food, she disappeared. When she reappeared, we asked for dessert menus. She came back and we informed her that we didn't want dessert and she whisked the menus away, not giving us a chance to ask for the bill, and disappeared again. She was gone so long that another server, probably noticing our frustration, came and took our credit card. We could see our server in the next room engaging with another table for at least 10-15 minutes, mask down, while we waited to pay and leave. I ended up going to get the car while my husband waited. He was approached by management who finally went to get our server so he could pay and we could leave.

They put in a new Nuvo home water system and replaced some faucets, with a bill at just under $3,000.00.  We were satisfied with the work and continued to purchase the water filters from them (at a price of approx. $100.00 each), and had them do other work. As we remain in our apartment only 3-4 months of the year, we only needed to change the filter once a year, per their instruction.  Upon our first replacement filter, we were advised McGill's no longer sold the Nuvo system they installed and any contact with the Nuvo company we needed to make, should be done by ourselves.  My husband replaced the filter, which they still sold.  In 2019 and 2020, we went to them again and replaced the filter for the second and third time.  Upon returning in Jan. of 2021, we purchased another (the 4th) filter from them. Upon getting ready to replace the filter, the entire unit and all of the plumbing they had installed, had come loose from the drywall.  They had merely anchored the entire unit, plumbing, etc. into the drywall with two screws placed into the drywall and through the 2018, 2019 and 2020 years, it had become loose and was merely hanging by the plastic plumbing pipes they had installed. If, due to the weight of the unit, the pipes had cracked or leaked, it would flood the apartments below us.  
My husband called them in January of 2021, and spoke with the manager Brett.  It was explained we needed to have the unit reattached to the wall with a system that would not rely solely on a screw placed into some drywall, which after some limited use, became loose and ultimately, no longer held the unit to the wall.  My husband suggested merely having a board attached to the wall, and the screws holding the heavy water system attached to the board.  It would be minimally expensive and could be accomplished in probably a half an hour and ensure the system did not break the pipes and flood the unit and units below ours.
Brett, the manager, advised my husband they would not stand behind the corrected installation because it had been done 3 years earlier.  We agreed it had been installed 3 years earlier, but the attachment to the wall had created a major problem and could be easily fixed, and since we had spent almost 3 thousand dollars with McGill's on this single visit (albeit, with add'l faucets purchased and installed), that we would think they would want to come out and correct the faulty installation.  Brett stated he would not stand behind the installation in any manner as it was done 3 years earlier.  When asked to speak with the owner, Brett indicated he made all the decisions and there would be no purpose to speak with the owner.
My husband let him know the initial installation had not been done correctly, and that was what needed correction.  We had also previously suggested other people contact McGill's because we had previously used them and had been satisfied.  Brett made it very clear, they would not attempt to correct the faulty installation.  This is the first time I have EVER, in my lifetime, provided a negative evaluation of work done at a residence of mine, but I was very disappointed in the response, or lack thereof, that they wouldn't stand behind a sloppy installation and attach it correctly to the wall. Previously, all my interactions with them were fine, but this is poor management and gets a very low grade to ensure customer satisfaction regarding their poor workmanship!!",2021-01-29 22:30:13,697,3498,

The current owner has been brewing (just for fun) for around 3 decades and you can surely taste the craft and variety in his brewing techniques.  

The 18 beers on tap are always changing out so every time you go there, you can expect to try a different beer.  A few of my favorites at that time were the Russian Imperial Stout (`10% ABV), the Red Rye Ale, and the Raspberry Barley Wine (18% ABV).  They limit the Raspberry Barley wine to 2 4oz. glasses.   (Rightfully so)

I recommend going with flights first before choosing your beer.  They have growlers and crowlers available to take home as well.",2021-01-18 15:34:26,303,1429,

Many chefs can-not be operators, and many operators cannot be chefs.  At The Block, even the simplest menu items appeared out of the kitchen's reach during a recent Summer visit.    

Based upon ambiance alone, we chose the sidewalk dining option at this popular stretch of Lockwood Avenue.  Our first mistake.  The Block Burger @ $15, add bacon @ $2, Kid's Mac & Cheese @ $4 and a house lemonade were logical choices.  Server Bre'Anna seemed taxed to provide a smile, but suggested the ""Flash Fried Brussels Sprouts"" @ $11 as an important order addition.  A protracted wait allowed us to notice a growing problem.  One which some staff seemed pre-conditioned to tackle, but, alas, they could not.  

A stark difference from nearby hotspots, this purveyor was not only overrun with flies, but it was clear this was not the first time.  Even before we alerted nearby workers, other staff were already spraying adjacent areas of the sidewalk.  This was an ominous sign.  They.  Were.  Everywhere.  In and of itself, a serious fly problem near a restaurant building usually connotes inner trouble.  

In a case like this, oftentimes the menu stars can salvage an otherwise uncomfortable experience.  While the Kid's Mac & Cheese was entirely delectable, the vastly overrated, and overpriced burgers were...sorely disappointing.  Over-seasoned, dry and chewy, the meat patties were awful.  It was puzzling.  The Block bills itself as a purveyor of showcase meat products.   Barely edible Sprouts rounded out a very unimpressive, albeit disastrous trip to the eatery.

I used another seamstress, recommended by Swoon, where my dress was purchased... and the bustle was awful. It was over 20 small ties under the dress, that was impossible to figure out. (My dress was extremely simple, so I was disappointed that she made the bustle so complicated). The dress also did not sit will on my chest, and the seamstress said that's how it's made, and added padding so it would fit better... 

After going back and forth with the seamstress, I decided I was wasting my time, and I found Saji's name on the list of recommended seamstresses from Swoon. 
I went to Saji's house, and she was absolutely lovely, she was so easy to work with, and you could tell she really cared.
While she was trying to figure out my bustle from the previous seamstress, she realized the poorly done bustle was sewn in, no wonder we couldn't figure it out, it was permanent. 
Saji worked quickly and efficiently to fix my dress and came up with a very simple user friendly bustle- all in the matter of days! She also fixed the top of my dress, and made it all sound so simple. She was dumbfounded to see the other seamstresses work. 
Saji truly saved my wedding dress, and likely my wedding day. I wasn't going to be able to un-bustle the dress without her, and I felt so comfortable in my dress, like it was made for me. (The way it should be :))

After my son's 2 1/2 year old wellness check, I told my friend we'd stop at Starbucks on our way to see her. This was on our way home, so it was a quick stop. Usually I go to the Starbucks on Racetrack, because it is a tad bit closer, but I'm starting to question my decision. That one always seems to have a line of cars (but it does move super quickly). At 10:40 a.m. on a Thursday, there were no cars at the drive through! The entire time I was there I didn't see another car. That's bananas to me. I'll have to come back and see if this holds true. 

I was thrown for a loop when I tried to order a pumpkin cream cold brew and a chocolate chip cookie. They didn't have either. The pumpkin cream cold brew is seasonal, which makes me sad. The employee was seriously one of the most helpful people I've ever met. She kept asking me about my taste preferences and offering suggestions. With other drive throughs, the employee probably would have just given me time to look over the menu and make another decision, but she seemed invested in helping me choose something I would like.

I ended up getting chocolate covered madeleines (for my 2 1/2 year old) and an Irish cream cold brew for myself. Both were huge hits. The Irish cream cold brew was the perfect amount of sweetness for me while still packing a caffeine punch and my son ate all the chocolate off the madeleine (which is what I expected).

When we opened up our order, it looked like they just gave us this tiny cup of just rice? The meat mixture was a tiny scoop on the side of the bowl so you couldn't even see it at first and it was pretty disappointing... especially when all the pics corporate shows are these beautiful loaded bowls with all kinds of green onions and veggies on top. After mixing it in the rice to meat ratio was too great, and you'd just get bites of plain rice... Which was disappointing because the meat stews were all super flavorful! I got the chicken teriyaki and my husband got the spicy kung pao. For $15, it just wasn't worth it to me at all.

The Bao were large and fluffy, and I liked that they came with the paper on the bottom to list what flavor they were since my husband and I ordered different ones. But we both loved the spicy mongolian beef and the chicken teriyaki bao. The BBQ Berkshire pork was okay, but we preferred the flavors on the other! This is my first time trying Bao, and all the dough was interesting to me... Maybe a little dry? I'll definitely have to find a local, non-chain bao place to try and update how they really compare!

Let's start with the service - top notch. Friendly, attentive, knowledgeable, the whole nine. They went above and beyond to offer vegetarian options for the entree.

The atmosphere is upbeat and exciting. Great music playlist, open air space, you can watch the chefs cook and prepare food pretty much from anywhere in the restaurant. The interior is lined with candles and wood finishings - super comfortable. We even felt this way during COVID, all the seating was spread out or blocked off with plexiglass. All tables came with personal hand sanitizer. 

Now the food...where to begin, where to begin. We absolutely splurged on this meal and did not regret it one bit. The menu is sophisticated, the plating is elegant, seeing it from the menu to being executed on the plate is true art.

Appetizers:
- wagyu beef carpaccio: this was my first time trying a dish like this. If I could describe the dish in one word, I would say ""fresh."" The beef was soft and earthy, topped with crunchy vegetables that really gave it a nice pop.

- coconut curry mussels: this is a big dish for an appetizer, could easily be an entree. The nice thing is that the coconut curry sauce is light (compared to a red/diavolo sauce) so it didn't quite fill me up. The lemongrass focaccia was a really nice touch, and paired nicely with soaking up the juice.

- black truffle risotto: unbelievable!! Hand-made pasta in a black truffle cream sauce with roasted artichokes - perfect combination of creamy and crunchy. Very filling and definitely shareable.

- orecchiette: wow - I could have eaten this 10 times over. Thick and creamy pasta, packed with a spicy punch from the long hots, but not overpowering as it was matched with the savory earthy flavors of the fennel sausage & broccoli rabe. 

- mushrooms: can't say enough good things about this. They based the framework of the meal around the scottish salmon dish - shitaake mushrooms were prepared on a bed of vegetable foie gras and finished with a miso pho broth. Out of this world!! So appreciated their accomodation to a vegetarian request and the use of local, seasonal produce.
 
- smoked pork chop: this was a home-run for me. Really slick plating, packed with flavor. The pork was cooked perfectly, and the juicy meat was matched with a delicious spicy/crunchy coating. Furthermore, the apple chutney really cut the savory/salty flavor of the pork and provided a nice fresh touch to the dish. 

From start to finish, I was just totally impressed. Would highly recommend checking this place out!

On the plus side - it is BYO! So take into consideration what you would save on drinks, and get that extra appetizer (or 2)",2021-01-26 03:23:38,567,2824,

As a penn grad and having friends who graduated from penn vet, I believed, as I'm sure many do, that they are the best. I noticed that my 4 year old big pup was walking stiffly and favoring his back right leg after long hikes so I figured might as well get him checked out. 

I had to wait 3 months for the appointment with a specialist, no big deal, and dropped him off. It was chaotic and stressful and took forever for people to answer the phone - again, didn't bother me too much but was a bit stressful. They sedated him, did x-rays, and called to say that yeah, he has some early signs of hip issues but that the big issue was a torn ACL and he needs surgery. I was shocked, he doesn't limp or seem to have knee pain, she said right knee - which was weird because he always seems to favor his right leg, I thought if anything his left was the problem. She said she could get him into surgery as soon as the next day. I felt helpless, the 6k surgery wasn't even the kicker, I have good pet insurance, but the idea that I'd have to rehab and sedate him for 2 months. He's goes on a 3 mile walk every day and is super high energy - this was a devastating reality for us. I asked for a few days to digest the information and the vet said to sedate him heavily while we decide. I felt like I had taken my car in to test the breaks because they were acting up and was told I need new tires. That appointment total was over $1000.

A few friends recommended I get a second opinion before agreeing to the surgery so I called VSEC on front street. Thank god I did. The amazing doctor there immediately put me at ease and said based on the xrays from penn and her assessment, operating on my dog is an insane conclusion. She found nothing wrong with his knee and confirmed the hip issues. And she agreed that the left leg was weaker than the right - if we had operated on his right knee we would have guaranteed needing to do it on his left as well. That appointment was only $200 btw and significantly better care.

I didn't want to believe penn was after cash, but after my experience of nearly traumatizing my dog with a needless invasive and expensive surgery, I'm never going back and feel obligated to share my experience. Needlessly traumatic.",2021-01-30 21:20:57,512,2398,

You basically sit down and they don't really say much to you or try to have a conversation. Since we are in a trying time with covid cleaning is one of those things you expect to see happening and I have to say honestly I didn't see much of it. I was the first one in the salon and they didn't ask me to use hand sanitizer or wash my hands prior to staring to work with me. Which was a huge negative for me personally. I know that I personally hand sanitized before walking in but I don't know if everyone who comes into the salon does that. While I was getting my toes done the women across from who was also getting her toes done and when she was finished they cleaned the tub where her feet were but they did not clean the chair in which she was sitting and put another women in that same chair that was not sanitized.

We have been meaning to try this place for a while, we made reservations for a Thursday evening. The ambience and garden is simply delightful the decor 
Is super cute( I wish I could see it in the daylight). Very Covid friendly - they check your temperature, all staff was wearing masking. There are heaters all around the outside space , We were very comfortable even though it was a chilly January evening. Our waiter and all staff were very kind and helpful.

For starters we tried the labne and the Muhammara , They were great portions & absolutely delicious. Both were flavorful and tasty! But the star of the show had to be the freshly baked pita bread. Reminded me of the restaurants in Lebanon  (nostalgic) it's amazing. 

For entrées I had the Samke harra which was seasoned to perfection! It was on the spicy side but still fantastic. It came with a side of turmeric rice which we took to go- I was stuffed the portions were perfect! My fiancé had the Kawarma (lamb) which he said was tender and well cooked with great flavor. 

We also had a side of fries with toum. My ONLY complaint was about the toum. I'm used to toum being STRONG. It was lacking flavor & needed more garlic - it tasted more like mayonnaise. Anyway we still ate it all!

I've never been to a Dutch Bros before and my gf wanted to pull in to get something... That's where the problems began.
First we pulled into a huge long line. And had to wait for a few minutes for each car at the window. That was about 20 minutes in line with no way to escape i when we decided to leave.
Next. There are servers who come out to your car to take you order... I've never been there before so I had no idea what to order and they had no menu for me to look at. They had a large drive through style menu but it only had three items on it and the server in the parking lot explained they have hundreds of items but don't have it on a menu so she just started listing things off to us and it was a TERRIBLY uncomfortable way to be pressured into ordering.

Now time to pay.... NO CASH. What TF??
So now I can't pay for my drinks because I didn't have my wallet on me and am stuck in a long line waiting to escape.

RV One was the exclusive distributor in the immediate Tampa area.  The sales process was low presure and I liked working with the salesman, Brant Graves.  The financing portion also went well.  
I took possession of my new RV after receiving a review of the motorcoach on October 29, 2020.   Now that I have ownership, I realize that the review of the coach was rushed and lacked some of the details that a new owner should have been given...  but that is as much on me as the dealerhip.  
Now comes the real issues.  When I arrived home with the new RV, I found that my awning did not work and the front cap fell off on the drive home.  On the third day of ownership I found that the hot water heater did not work.  I called Brant and informed him of the issues and he assisted me with getting a service appointment.  I received a call from the service department and they gave me an appointment date of January 5, 2021!  Over two months to get the issues looked at.  I had three trips planned for November and December.  I tried calling the service department several times to compain and move up the date, but no one has ever answered the phone.  NO PERSON WILL ANSWER THE SERVICE CALLS!  I would leave messages and no call back.  I contacted the sales person again and received a call back several days later.  I informed him of the problems and received a call and then followup  text from a representative from the service depatment.  She was polite and provided me with instructions on downloading an app for my phone and then provided me the Jayco customer service telephone number.  
Jayco customer advised me to contact a mobile repair service.  The downside of using a mobile company is that I have to pay for the warranty work up front and apply for repayment with Jayco.  Also, they do not reimburse for any service charges, if applicable.  On a side note, I chose a company, Happy Camper, and the tech was great and he has fixed my issues.  The awning issue and hot water issue were a result of RV One NOT conducting a proper preperation of the coach.  Bottom line is they half-assed the preperation.  Happy Camper did not have a front cap and the wiring is still exposed.
So, I have called RVOne service department 3 times since January 1 to order a cap and still, they do not answer the phone, and I have not received a call back!  I need to order a front cap.

I will bullet cons and pros:
- strange that I was called the day of reservation and asked to call back to reconfirm my reservation. Consider a text reply option. I can understand for a large party but it was a table for two. Then when I called back the message says something to the effect that they are slow to check messages. I was concerned then that day that our reservations were perhaps no longer confirmed. They were so what's the point of calling??
- Dining room arrangement odd. Server station in the middle of room seemed like a chain restaurant. My side of table had me seated where the fireplace mantle was next to my head. 
- Food... Salad wasn't very good, wife's soup was bland she had to add salt and still just not impressive. Out of scallops (I understand this happens), steak was a huge miss. It was described as a strip but it was a sirloin lacking taste. The sides were bland as well.
- The dessert was lacking as well. Reminded me of something Apple Bees would serve. 
- All in all the food was the worst part of the visit. It was like they attempted to be be fancy but missed the mark considerably. I would have preferred to pay more for a decent cut of steak instead of trying to pass off a sirloin as a good steak. I would highly recommend using more spices also because everything was bland. 
- Ordered a dirty martini and only two vodkas and one was Tito's. No Goose or Kettle, etc.
- The small details. These are not huge things but help paint the overall picture of you are looking for a dinner place for an important occasion... rolled silverware, forks not replaced for each course and box your own take-a-way. No big deal at a chain but surprising for a restaurant that refers to themselves as a scratch kitchen with local sourced ingredients. 
- Bar area looked nice had it not looked like a staging area or extension of the kitchen. It looked like a good place to have a drink if it were cleaned up. I really wondered if they even allow for customers to just come for a drink and cheese plate (which is all I would consider coming back for) based on the mess.
- Last the menu was titled winter/Covid menu. It went on making excuses for shortcomings before we could even order. We all understand there might be some gaps in service during this time. Placing this on the menu seems like something you expect at a chain restaurant. As well when we do get out for what we expect to be a good diner we want to forget about Covid for a moment, not be reminded of it on the menu... and certainly do not want to be told go ahead and just expect less.
Pros:
- Service wasn't bad, not exceptional but not horrible.
- The waiter was nice but you could tell he was working with what he had. 
- Wine was good.
- Prices were actually less than expected but I would rather pay more for better food.
- Outside of the server station and table arrangement the dining room had good character and was quaint. 
- Cheese plate was good. Again not overly impressive but good.

To sum it up it was very disappointing if you are expecting fine dining. Perhaps with much much lower expectations it would have seemed better.

I read other reviews and I am jealous of those who gave 5 stars. Perhaps they came before Covid or had much lower expectations. As for the other 2s and 3s it seems they had similar experiences. That being said I would prefer not to get a response from the owner either. I read the responses to other poor reviews and I don't care for the demeanor. Those responses take very little accountability and provide more excuses than anything else and a bit condescending to say the least. I would recommend just owning the feedback, making a point to look into how to improve and leave the rest out. Had that been the case from what I read I would have been far less detailed (albeit very accurate) and more likely to return to give it another chance at a later date. But I don't see that being the case since the owner seems more focused on making excuses than making improvements.",2021-01-12 03:46:50,861,4179,

The shrimp cocktail were I 25-30 per lb which is nonsense for a shrimp cocktail. Granted it was inexpensive but .80 worth of shrimp for $7 is a bad look. Better to have it priced higher and get a better product than what I got.
Entree: "" Prime"" ribeye with augratin potatoes and sauteed mushrooms.

Augratin potatoes were microwaved spuds with some melted cheese

Mushrooms were basically boiled with no seasoning, sliced in some water. Mushrooms in  steakhouse should be whole and have some personality. They tasted like they dumped some mushrooms into used hotdog water

Ribeye was tough, chewy and basically inedible. Not a prime cut mind you No seasoning, undercooked then when I sent it back for a recook it came back two minutes later scalding hot and rubber. It was clearly microwaved. I took a few bites struggling for that savory satisfaction but there was none to be had.

Bread pudding had decent flavor but poor consistency and was not presented with any level of care. It was was slip in a soup cup. 

I will say the service and attention was good. Rashaad was very pleasant, prompt and accomodating and held nothing against his service as the failures had nothing to do with his performance. I feel you tip according to the delivery of the food not the condition of it. He did his job.

I was also disappointed the manager on duty did not personally address my concerns but rather just deleted the items from my total. To have the mainstay of the meal be a failure merits more than the comp of dissatisfactory items but also the apologies. I will not charge you for what you did not enjoy but here is something from us. A coffee, a dessert even comp the soda. It's not the dollar amount, it's the thought.

Undesirable experience as I much thatvthe only part of my experience worth what was spent was the gratuity for the service",2021-01-30 04:45:29,367,1879,

But this lady was determined to still have a nice chef-prepared dinner for her wedding anniversary, and she was going to trek out by bus and trudge through icy air to get it.

Italian pasta was the plan, and after much searching on Yelp (whereby I discovered many COVID19-related closures), I finally found Bistro La Baia. With promising reviews, we decided to try this option on the outskirts of Rittenhouse Square. Lobster ravioli for me, and penne arrabiata for the significant other. The food was ready right on time when I arrived, and came with a complimentary bundled of delicious slices of Italian bread that practically crackles when bitten into.

The entrees were quite good as well. The ravioli consisted of six pieces, two sauteed shrimp and a rich, creamy tomato sauce. That and half a piece of the Italian bread made for a perfectly portioned and delicious meal for me. The penne arrabiata was a larger portion, and while not the best ever, it still met with the S.O.'s overall approval.

The sidewalk seating wooden pods were empty when I arrived, but that was before 6PM, so maybe the restaurant was busier later in the evening. It really gave me the impression of the sort of place that would primarily be frequented by residents of the surrounding neighborhoods. The one person I interacted with there was very polite and helpful (even giving me time to put my mittens back on before handing me the food for my journey home). I probably wouldn't have thought to try Bistro La Baia under most circumstances, so it was a nice discovery. I hope that it'll be able to survive the wave of restaurant closures that Philadelphia has seen as a result of the pandemic.",2021-01-02 02:18:27,364,1866,

I had just suffered through an endless check out line when my wife called telling me that there were a few additional items that needed picking up. 

I quickly dumped my purchases in the car & procured the required items. After grabbing the beer I wanted & alone in the check out line was told by Eileen, that ""due to a previous customer having too many items only beer & wine could be purchased in the beer garden."" I had five total items & there were no customers at all in the beer garden. The move by Eileen was not only unwarranted but threw a wrench in my complete plan. 

After being completely stymied I had no choice but to suffer thru self checkout and waste another twenty minutes.   When it was finally my turn to check out Arlean came over from the beer garden & apologized for her coworkers behavior saying there had been an unruly customer earlier in the day & that had rubbed the coworker the wrong way. 

I understand & appreciate Arlean's sincere apology but am still upset by the way that I was treated.  Because I have been a lifelong Shoprite shopper it pains me not to have been back since Christmas Eve but because of one inconsiderate employees actions I have not been.

Seeing Arlean, Wendy, Maria, Helen, & Dorothy is always the best aspect of coming to Shoprite (in addition to the convenience) but thinking that one bad seed might be at the beer cafe's register and keep me from checking out a couple items w/ a beer purchase isn't worth the hassle.

Drinks came out quickly. However we waited about ten minutes to even receive a menu. My mom and her friend came before we received menus and decided to join our party. They were given drinks shortly after. We asked for just a few minutes to order our meal. Our waitress (purple reddish dyed hair) proceeded to sit inside and not come out after about 15-20 minutes had passed. My mom went in to get her and walked in on her conversation as she was complaining to another waitress that ""she just didn't give a shit today"". After she said she'd be right out, she walks onto the patio and takes their order before us. Enraged is an understatement. Another waitress had to pick up her work as she did not come out to check on her tables even other than us. The food came out after a while, she did not offer us any refill on drinks, empty ketchup bottle on the table that I was never even given a chance to ask for a new one, because she sat inside well after we were even finished. Another table had to ask the hard working waitress for something our lazy waitress had forgot, while I also had to stop her to get the waitress because she never brought us our check. During these times it is important for us to take care of restaurants, but having her as an employee representing Metro Diner is a disgrace. She was careless, rude, and could truly as she stayed ""give a shit less"". The food was great but her service is the reason I will not return.

Most of the appetizers were ok and needed work to get it to the taste they need to be. Our favorites were the Jalapeño cheeseburger spring rolls and the tempura shrimp poppers. The charbroiled oysters were dry and burnt ( they need to pay special attention to details). We ordered loaded tots and the waitress did not tell us they didn't have tots and brought us French fries that we sent back and they did not charge us. The mojito did not taste like one and was very strong and bitter( must pay attention to recipe) don't make drinks too strong. Their sliders were also ok. Bahn mi buttered steak sliders needed more flavor and the meat more caramelization flavor to it. Sesame chicken sliders were not at all sesame chicken. Their batter needs work to make it more tasty.  No sesame flavor and could use some sweet and sour sauce to it for added flavor. One of our favorites were the soy glazed pork belly Skewer which was tasty but the Vietnamese buttered steak cubes and lemongrass chicken were not the taste of Vietnam. I would suggest to go to a Vietnamese restaurant and learn the spices of Vietnam and redo these dishes to taste like Vietnamese cuisine. The atmosphere was nice with heaters to keep us warm outside which was an added touch. The service was acceptable but hoped for better service because not a lot of people there. We had to ask for water and it took a while to get it. Also we made reservations at 3pm and our food didn't come until 4:10. Be prepared to wait some time. You can't be in a hurry to eat here.

During the COVID-era, they provide both garden and patio dining. The patio dining is a number of small private pods with heating either from below or above. It keeps you pretty warm even on the coldest of days. I'd recommend making a res because they're quite busy!

For the food, you can either do the ""taste of suraya"" ($65/person) or a la carte on weekdays. We opted for the tasting menu which seemed to have a little bit of everything. To start, you are given a number of different mediterranean spreads. My favorites were probably the baba ganoush (eggplant) and the muhammara (red pepper&walnut) dips. They are served with a crispy, warm pita. For the appetizer, you can choose from any of the mezze. The standout here was the fatteh which was warm chickpeas paired with crispy eggplant and crispy pita. So good! For the entree, each guest can choose from the list of mashawi options. We opted for the steak kebab and the kawarma. I thought both were perfectly cooked and well spiced. I was suprised by the presentation of the kawarma which is basically a cube of lamb meat but it was very tender and delectable. Lastly, for dessert, the kanefeh was a very interesting fried cheese plate which mixed both sweet and savory elements. 

We also tried a few of the drinks - I would recommend the wanderer. Vodka, poblano, grapefruit, bell pepper, and lava salt. It's excellent!

Lastly, the service was pretty good. There was a significant gap between the entrees and dessert but otherwise they did a great job and I'm sure they were busy.

VsVYl8A7nxbcmfsqYNpArg,NJDGZ-TWLAejPwjCXjQm0w,OR4fxnKx2urdFv2HSLfRjA,5,0,0,0,"Just bought a condo and the inspection revealed some plumbing work was necessary: water heater, toilets, and a leak in one bathroom sink. I contacted three top-rated plumbing firms on Yelp to provide estimates. Only Southern Arizona Plumbing was willing to send someone out to actually look at the unit--everyone else would only do it virtually.

I didn't mind, because I had photos taken by the home inspection that showed all the work that needed to be done. But because Southern Arizona Plumbing actually sent someone out, they diagnosed the cause of the leak and knew exactly what needed to be replaced.

The cheapest bidder wouldn't give a firm quote--just an estimate based on what they thought the effort would be, with the real cost to be determined after the work was complete. Of the other two, Southern Arizona was about 20% less than the other. Since they had made the effort to scope the work, I had more confidence they knew what was required.

They showed up on the scheduled day, texting us when they were on the way over so we were ready when they came. When they shut off the main water valve, it got stuck (wouldn't reopen). All three vendors had expressed concern about this, because from the photos they could see it was a cheap valve and being 25 years old this was a risk. Because this was a condo, to replace the valve they would need to shut off the water to another unit as well. They were very professional and contacted the HOA and the other condo residents to explain an emergency repair was required. The project lead--who had done the original estimate--came over to supervise the work. Since this work was not part of the original project scope, I expected them to charge us more, but they didn't. 

This extra task made it a long day for them, but they stayed until all the work was completed (10+ hours on site). That night we discovered that one of the new toilets wasn't working properly--it continued to leak water from the tank into the bowl after flushing--so we called the next day and they came back the following day and replaced the flushing mechanism with no hesitation.

The crew was masked the entire time, although one crew member would take his mask off whenever we weren't in the immediate vicinity. They were careful when bringing in the new toilets and water heater and in taking out the old one to avoid banging into walls. They cleaned up the job areas well. My only complaint--and it is a small one--was that sometimes they touched the walls with dirty hands leaving visible marks. We were able to clean these up, however.

Summary:
+ Came on site to perform estimate
+ Arrived exactly when they said they would
+ Picked up toilets I picked out from Home Depot, saving me a trip
+ Stayed late to finish the work so plumbing was usable
+ Did extra work to ensure new plumbing would be reliable
+ Responsive when we reported an issue
+ Reasonable price for the quality of work performed
+ Wore masks while working (mostly)

They were on a short wait, and bar was full (due to social distancing), so at host's suggestion we ran across the street to Cycle for a beer.  Estimated wait was 20 minutes, and it wasn't even that long - texted us when table was ready.

Seated immediately when we walked in - in the ""lobby"" area, and immediately greeted by our server.

Short but very interesting wine list - and our server was very knowledgeable about the wines.  We started with a glass each of an interesting white Greek varietal (Malagousia, perhaps?) that I'd never tried before, and it was wonderful - smelled very sweet, but drier to taste.  I want to track this down to have at home.  Selected a glass of the Portugese Douro to drink with my lamb.  

We split the beet salad special - it was enough for an entree and was excellent.  Would definitely order again.  Note to the chef: beets came out in larger-than bite sized chunks - I'd personally have preferred smaller pieces - but that's just a minor note, not a complaint.

Wife went with the cavatappi pasta and I had the lamb special.  Portions are large and both were fantastic.  This is a place where I just want to go down the menu - everyting on it looked interesting.

Opportunities for improvement:  

I prefer written specials and dessert menus - or at least visible boards if you don't want to do that much printing.  Pet peeve, but I hate having a list recited at me verbally, especially now in the world of masked servers.  

Coffee was underwhelming, and espresso service would be a nice addition.   Next time we will just skip coffee here and get it at one of the many coffee places in the area.",2021-01-11 16:50:36,358,1724,

The Bellwether very well maybe the best dining experience I have had. The ambience, the service, the food, the drinks...just everything TOP NOTCH.

This was a perfect spot for a fancy, intimate NYE dinner with the girlfriend. The place is absolutely gorgeous. Every little detail seemingly though out from the lighting, to the curtains,  Just walking in, I felt like this was going to be a place I'd love to frequent. I'd specifically requested a booth in the bar area, having perused pictures and I'm glad we did. The booth offered a good view of the entire place, from the gorgeous bar and dining area, to the outside patio.  Our server Brodie greeted us promptly, and was a huge part of the amazing experience we had here. You could just tell, he enjoyed his job as friendly, outgoing, and attentive as he was. 

I could go here for drinks alone. The cocktail/drink menu was vast, and offered pretty much anything anyone could ever want. A long list of wines, bourbons, rums, and cognacs as well as numerous craft cocktails. As a beer snob, I was quite impressed with even some of the offerings on their beer list. With any higher end dining experience, I tend to at least enjoy one cocktail prior to moving on to beer.  Kudos to the Bellwether for my first drink, making me want to sample more cocktail offerings instead. Having 2 of my own, and sampling from the 2 my girlfriend ordered my favorite of the evening was the Paradise Lost. 

I do look forward to going back for some of the other appetizers. My girlfriend being pickier we started with the Togarashi fries. These were absolutely perfectly cooked. The green onions that topped them was a much welcomed addition, and the nuac cham and gochujang ketchup both fantastic for dipping. For the main course, I opted for the Elk chop that was on special.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned it just melted in your mouth. I finished every bit of the spinach and purple potatoes that come with it as well.  I sampled the Pork Steak my girlfriend had ordered and it was the most tender juicy pork Ive ever had. For dessert we shared a piece of cheesecake, which may have also been the best piece of cheesecake I have ever had. The cracker crust was phenomenal, and the raspberry lime coulis a perfect fuity tartness.

On Fri., Nov. 20, 2020, we were having a shower installed in our upstairs master bathroom. A valve malfunction caused a flood that caused water damage in our downstairs living space. The shower installer said he had a restoration company he had used and would call them right away to start taking care of the damage. Two employees with Dry Pro arrived and cut up our 1 1/2-year-old carpet beyond repair, threw out roughly 25 square feet of laminate flooring (which was no longer available) without asking us if we wanted to try and dry it out, and threw out two shower curtains we had grabbed to help keep the water off the carpet. They hooked up equipment downstairs and in the upstairs bathroom and said they would be back at 8 a.m. on Monday, the 23rd to meet with the shower installer to take moisture readings so he could continue with the project. 
By 10 a.m. on the 23rd, Dry Pro was still not at our house. We called their office to be told they were almost at our house. At 11 a.m., Shane from Dry Pro called to say they were scheduled to be at our house and that they would be there by 11:30, was that okay? I told him no it wasn't since they were supposed to be at the house at 8. Instead of being apologetic and hustling to my house, he told me I clearly didn't understand how traffic and automobiles worked. He then went on to inform me he was the owner of the company. He repeated this information 6 more times. He finally made it to our house where upon doing moisture readings, found more water damage. When we asked why it wasn't found on the 20th, his response was that he owned the company, and the two employees that came out were new and still being trained. I asked him why he didn't come out and supervise his employees if they were still being trained, but never got an answer. He then said someone would be out on the 25th to take another moisture reading. We insisted it be him and that we expected him at 9 a.m. More babble ensued until he finally confirmed. On the 25th, still more water damage was found. When I asked why it wasn't found earlier, he said no one told him where the upstairs bathroom was in regard to the downstairs. In other words, I have no idea what I am doing or how to find water damage. Six days into the initial accident and due to Dry Pro's incompetence, it's getting worse. More drywall was removed, more holes were put in our home to dry out the area and more babble from the owner. He assured us he would be out on the 27th to take another moisture reading. We never saw Shane again. His 2 employees arrived on Fri, 11/27. Watching them left us shaking our heads. They were blowing into the end of the meters to get them to work, not probing the affected areas and having us tell them where to take the readings. They assured us it was all dry and the shower installer could go to work. 
Because of Dry Pro's absolute debacle of the whole situation, we had to have significant drywall repaired, a bunch of flooring replaced (which no longer matches what is throughout the house), and endless hours of people in and out of our home during Thanksgiving week and through the weekend before Christmas. December 19th was when it was finally all put back together. 
We have spent countless hours trying to get reimbursement for our shower curtains as Shane promised, but Shane never returned our calls or emails. He finally mailed a check when we said we were prepared to take him to small claims court. 
We also have proof that when he billed the shower company (who was paying for the damage), Dry Pro charged $1,000 for drying an area of our house that doesn't exist. We let the shower company know immediately of this discrepancy. 
We saw that Dry Pro's ad on Thumbtack says they wear masks, gloves, and disinfect everything they touch. Big lie! They did none of that. Not once. Is this really someone you would want in your home taking care of a problem? Based on our interaction with Shane and his company, Dry Pro, there are not enough words to describe how horrific they are to deal with. If you hire Dry Pro, watch out for incompetence, for being incorrectly charged, and for being spoken down to.",2021-01-08 21:34:12,874,4216,

My car died in my driveway and I called a service repair guy to replace the battery after a jump failed. The technician that arrived told me that he tested my battery and it had no issues. Instead, he told me my issue was likely with the fuel pump or fuel injector, and even warned that if I've been using bad fuel my entire engine may be shot. I don't know much about cars, but those things all sounded quite a bit more expensive than a battery replacement, so I was a bit panicked.

I previously had a local mechanic I used and, while they always did a great job with the actual car, I felt like they ran the price up on me every chance they got and I wanted to try out a new place. I was recommended Hyatt's by a neighbor and had the car towed there same day. I told Jon what the issue was and he said he could get to it by the end of the next day. He called me exactly when he said he would the next day and told me he found zero issues with any of the parts the previous technician described. He had no clue how that guy tested my battery as operable when it was apparently shot beyond repair and needed  replacement. After popping in a new battery, the car drove off the lot the next morning with no issues. That was it, no new engine, no new fuel pump, just a basic battery replacement. 

An honest mechanic is tough to find. I don't know the first thing about cars, so the best I can do is read reviews in hopes of identifying a mechanic that is trustworthy and bring my car there.

The popcorn chicken and orange chicken are very flavorful. Chicken was saturated with flavor, possibly soaked in a brine prior to frying... tender juicy yet crunchy . Chocolate almond churro took about 25 minutes to come out , my son thoroughly enjoyed the churro you can't go wrong with dessert. 

Second visit we ordered garlic noodles with shaken beef and garlic noodles with shaken chicken. Both impressive dishes , enjoyed the chargrilled flavor in the chicken. A bit on the oily side which can request less of next time. Steak options are cooked medium or well, it was a good quality very soft and not chewy. Garlic noodles is just as-is freshly minced garlic with lo mein like noodles. All plentiful portions and filling . 

I hear the wings were very good however we were not impressed with the lemon pepper wings . The wing size and fried texture was nice , seasoned with salt and pepper . Final step of dousing with lime juice was overpowering , as thats all you taste . It was so salty that our lips shriveled up from 6 pieces . May be back to try the different sauces of wings. 

The pink flamingo drink was delicious I ordered that half sweet. Overall it looks like this new business is doing well there was a line going out the door. There is seating indoors and outdoors. 

Plenty of workers in the front however seem to be disorganized. Putting in the phone order I must have repeated myself about five times and the gentleman still did not understand my request. Picking up the order was a repeat of unorganization . the Covid shield impedes all of communication and hard to communicate or hear. We repeated our drink order (that was called in) twice upon pickup to 2 different people , perhaps assign specific persons to specific tasks so they are not all running around and seem overwhelmed.",2021-01-30 22:19:19,371,1948,

I came for the group fitness classes. After evaluating the classes, I was excited about the instructors (one in particular) who led the classes. I thought I could get a lot of benefit from it because I have learned over the years that an instructor who meshes well with my goals can make all the difference. 

My favorite instructor ended up leaving suddenly. The other instructors were good, but not a good enough fit to make me want to stay. It's unlikely that I would have signed up in the first place. Again, not bad people, not bad at what they do, just not a good fit for me. But by then I was stuck in a 6 month contract. Moreover, they have a $39 ""enhancement"" fee that hits 4 months in unexpectedly.

I would have liked to be allowed a graceful exit from the contract due to the extenuating circumstances of my favorite instructor leaving. Instead, I've had to pay $177 for the two months plus the ""enhancement"" fee for a gym I don't even go to anymore. 

Yes, I could have continued working out and taking classes, but the value of the membership changed out from under me in a material way and this didn't seem to trouble anyone else. I was just told that the situation was ""unfortunate"" but that a contract is a contract.

So I get it, there is a contract, but it feels predatory. When they change their service in a significant way and I have to keep paying, that feels bad. And now here I am writing a negative review instead of recommending the gym to everyone. I don't really understand why you'd want someone who is unhappy to keep paying. Maybe there are business reasons at the franchise level, I don't know. 

Again, everyone is friendly and I'll even admit that they have other instructors, and that other students weren't necessarily bothered by the change. But I was, and in the end the letter of the contract was more important to them.

So that's my story. Good people, clean place, just be aware that they might switch things on you and leave you with the bill.",2021-01-07 20:09:16,469,2203,

There were communication problems but I overlooked it. I then hired outside of my insurance problem to do a major job for me. The home is vacant and several times I tried to make arrangements for someone to be there for them to show up. Having my daughter take off work and they didn't show. I originally talked to the worker in the office to try to hire them. She said she understood the urgency and would get back to me as soon as possible. Well 2 weeks later I called and asked if she had an answer. She asked me to refresh her memory and she called the owner and he got back to me about the job. He seemed like a very nice person and had my best interest at heart. He assured me that the job I was paying for was total cost from excavation to planting grass etc. I hired them even though I was still having communication problems. I was working against the clock due to winter weather. After several times of we will be there. I would call the night before and everything is a go I was told, to find the next morning I get a call ""sorry we don't have the part needed"" Now who schedules a major job without the major part?

I originally asked what came in the three piece chicken, and was told a leg, thigh, and breast, and they can't switch out the pieces because then they would have to throw away the rest of the pieces from the other sets they took from. I didn't really understand why, and I just wanted some chicken legs, but I settled for the wings, and they made up for the original disappointment of not getting any legs.
While you are pretty limited in picking out the kind of chicken pieces you want, the person who ordered after me asked for the chicken sandwich without the buttermilk ranch seasoning, so at least the sandwich seems to be customizable.
I didn't realize at first that you get a donut with every chicken order, so that was definitely a nice treat! My only regret is not eating the donut first. I ate my wings and fries first, so my donut (which is made fresh when you order) was cold by the time I got to it, and the oil kind of seeped in and made some of the inside a little mushy. It was definitely the kind of donut that would have been much better hot, but when I had it cold, it was really sweet and VERY oily. I did get a few bites of just the inside untouched by the oil, and it was soooo good. You can see in the picture, it's very fluffy, and it had a great taste (and I'm not usually a fan of plain donuts, but I would definitely have more of these!). My advice is to try them hot, and I can't wait to do so myself.
The fries were pretty basic. They kinda tasted like you could just get them out of the freezer isle of the grocery store and that's really all I have to say about them. 
I brought home one wing and some french fries and reheated them for dinner, and it's probably not something I would do again. I may have set the bar too high, expecting so much after how good it tasted fresh during lunch, but reheated, it was considerably less enjoyable.
As good as it is, I wouldn't go here often because it is pretty expensive for lunch. I got lunch with someone who got the same thing as me, and for 2 fries, 2 5pc wings, and the included donuts, the meal was almost $30. 
Federal Donuts will be a nice occasional lunch when I want to treat myself, and the only thing keeping me from getting their delectable chicken and donuts every day is the price.... And maybe the fact that that much oil is pretty bad for you, but that's besides the point. If you don't mind the price, I would highly recommend you try this place out.
My takeaways and tips are:
Chicken wings: a little pricy but so tasty and worth it.
French fries: meh, they're just average but I would probably get them again to have a side with my meal.
Donut: sweet and fluffy, great flavor, but eat it hot!!
Price: I'm just a college student who generally tries to keep lunch under $10, so this is a little much for me, but it's a good treat-yourself lunch for me, and I think it's worth the cost.",2021-01-08 02:16:36,661,2959,

We ordered to Mules for drinks, I liked mine but our daughter did not like it and they were very kind to replace with a Strawberry Fields one more to her tastings. 
Our dinners
Off the Boat Grouper Sandwich- very good with fries
Cioppino(26$) ( mixed seafood in tomato broth) very good and not too salty
Cajun Seafood Pasta (23$) very good with bread
Not Your Roommates Ramen (16$) very filling not fond of pickled veggies
Korean Style Short Ribs (19$) this was ribs with Korean BBQ sauce, ok but not what we expected.
We topped it off with Key Lime Pie (5$), and chef special cheese cake (6$). The pie was good but could have used more lime, kids loved the cheese cake.

We ordered the lobster rolls, calamari sandwich, the fried variety that includes calamari, shrimp, oysters and scallops. Also ordered the crab cakes and french fries. The food was DRIPPING in oil. This place takes god knows how many orders a day and all these people seem to have no problem with oily greasy and under/overcooked food??? The fries were raw. My 2 year old was disgusted because they were wet and crunching. I didnt believe her til i tried them myself. The calamari and shrimp were like rubber. I had to spit out the calamari because it would not break up in my mouth no matter how hard i chewed. All it did was let out oil in my mouth. The lobster rolls to be fair had a heaping portion of lobster, but why was the bread hard?? Is this how its supposed to be? Ive had lobster rolls before and the bread has never been this dry and almost stale like. The crab cakes were also soaked in oil. Every bite, all i could taste is oil.

He pulled similar nonsense with me when I needed to get a reservation I'd made through a 3rd party site updated to include my travel companion's name when I couldn't make the trip.  At no point did I ask that the reservation get cancelled.  HE was the one who overroad the No Cancel so we could immediately rebook with my friends name.  Again, this was all Brian's idea.  Both my friend and I ended up getting charged for the room and Brian blamed me and blamed the 3rd party site while being quite confrontational.  ""This all should have worked but I've already put too much time into researching this so I'm not going to give a refund.""  I guess if I were in my mid-50's and stuck managing a run down, bed bug infested dump for as long as he has I'd be bitter at the world too.

Another excuse that keeps coming up in the reviews is that ""our system won't allow us to make that change"".  You know what?  GET A BETTER SYSTEM!  Not that difficult.  

Thankfully the 3rd party site was ethical about it and issued me a refund, but not until after they'd tried to work out the refund with Brian.

Within 24 hours of purchase (125 Miles on the ODO) the infotainment system (Radio) in the NEW truck stopped working.  I took it to this dealership because they are closest to me.  When I arrived at Sloan, I was told by the person checking me in, within the garage, that I needed to take it back to the original dealership, then the service manager told me I would need to take it to the original dealer and if I didn't and SLOAN had to fix it, then I would have to wait a week (7 days) for an appointment and they would potentially not pay for the rental car.  After my protest, he actually asked me what i expected, for them to shut down the dealership to deal with my issue?  Sad.  When I asked to escalate to the GM they sent the used car manager out and he told me  I would have to wait a week (7 days) for an appointment and they would potentially not pay for the rental car, that would be up to the original dealership and Toyota.  

After spending more than an hour at the dealership arguing with them, being told by the used car manager that he is going to make some calls and get back to me later, and then leaving, calling the original dealer and having them  call the GM at Sloan, I went back and they finally agreed to repair the NEW truck, gave me a Corolla as a loaner (new truck versus BS OLD and dirty Corolla) and were able to fix the NEW TRUCK within 5 hours.  

Bottom Line, I hate that I am a 20 Year Exclusive Toyota auto guy, but THAT ENDED TODAY.  Side note, I'm pissed that I got rid of a Toyota Camry and bought my mother in law a Rav4 less than a month ago.  I was a loyal customer! 

I don't like it, but I would not recommend using this dealership.  In fact, in the future I am going to look at Infinity or Honda instead of Toyota. 

If all else fails, TriCounty Toyota has treated me nice in the past, but they are 40 minutes from me.

I'm a chronic over orderer and usually end up with a ton of leftovers. This time, however, as I sit here mouth breathing trying to muster another bite, I can't bring myself to packing the food up later. Its just too good!

Hawaiian spring rolls have a perfectly crisp shell, filled with faintly smokey pork. The pork has a familiar taste, with a delicious pacific island flair.

The HEFTT is option you can feel good about eating. The rice, beef, scallion pancake and sauce will leave you satisfied without feeling like you need to avoid food and spend the next week in the gym. 

The wings are awesome! Crisp, tender, juicy, fall off the bone kinda perfect. No extra sauces needed; eat as they are. Mild kick.

The Hangry Hawaiian is the best burger I have had in a really long time! And I am always on the lookout for great burgers. I had beef, topped with pork, bacon, jalepenos and pineapple. Its an amazing combo of balanced, sweet heat. I loved it! (The fries were also really good)

The haupia was a sweet, unexpected addition also. Its a buttery, graham cracker crust, layered with sweetened, purple sweet potato, the another layer of a coconut milk pudding.

We placed an order in October, they couldn't deliver and install until December and they asked me to fix a few things which meant removal of my only heat source before they installed. Then they called me 2 nights before, to let me know it would be an additional week or two before they could come. Amy was rude and condescending and as I explained I had to no heat with kids in the home, she proceeded to tell me the law in NV (I live in CA, Amy‍). AND, the irony, we're a family of attorneys but she felt very empowered in that moment, so we let her have her moment....The manager at this point was somewhat helpful and gave me a unit off his showroom floor, which was completely different then what we ordered and paid for but I needed heat and didn't care anymore. He said he wasn't aware we did not have any heat, even through that was expressed to Amy numerous times!! Clearly the message wasn't relayed, but she was protecting the law in her mind so again we can laugh that off. A week after install, it stopped working. It would only get to 64 degrees to begin with and for a supposedly 40,000 BTU unit that's odd. Called them and good ole Amy said I could wait 2 additional weeks for service, again with no heat. She was annoyed I called right when they opened and that they had not had a chance to get settled in yet...After numerous phone calls about their defective product, the manager Bryan (he's a real treat) finally calls me toward the end of the day and was zero assistance. He was rude, short, and acted as if it was my fault their product wasn't working!!! And how dare I be upset with his staff . THEN, after Amy said she would make sure to reimburse us the difference from my original order, she STILL CHARGED US FOR THE ORIGINAL ONE!!!!!!!!! They are unprofessional and rude.

TLDR: will go back to try more of their dishes and definitely churros, but make sure to go at an off-hour. 

-Popcorn chicken - by far the best dish they have here. Soft yet slightly crispy with a light herb flavor that can be eaten by itself completely (no sauce needed!) 

-Magonada - I really liked their mangonadas because they are super refreshing drink with chunks of mango on top. But it is an acquired taste because it's a combination of sweet, sour, and slightly saltiness all in one.

-pho - I was pleasantly surprised at how good their pho is. It tastes like an authentic pho with the beef broth and herbs. 

-shaken beef was alright for me -- the beef chunks are flavorful for tender, but nothing that's super amazing. It's good by itself, but I'd go directly for the pho and the popcorn chicken next time. 

A couple of tips:

-they are having a 20% discount on all orders because it's their grand opening weekend.

-parking is a pain on a Friday night in that plaza. Not their fault, but the Anthony's pizza next door does curbside pickup and there's a line of cars that just blocks the driveway so it's VERY hard to even get into that plaza to find parking.

-a LOT of people are in there ordering -- their place only has about 6-8 tables inside but they have two tables on the outside in the front as well as a couple tables on the outside in the back. Even with all that, it is very hard to find seating. 

-if you do go, make sure to go on an off hour (definitely not lunch or dinner hours) or you will have to do take out.

-services is really nice and they really cater to your needs. BUT because this is their grand opening weekend and how many people are already there, be prepared to wait for your food.",2021-01-09 02:24:49,389,1846,

With the deer statues sitting on the corner, it definitely catches your eye. Well, I finally made it and as an added bonus, I caught there world famous Jingle Rails exhibit. The Eiteljorg Museum is a well organized and clean museum located next to White River Park. Total disclosure, I went on a day that they were giving free admission. But, it is normally only $15 for adults and $8 for kids. They are taking COVID very seriously and have a few safeguards in place. Before you enter, you are required to take a temperature check and use some hand sanitizer. And of course masks are required.

They validate parking, when available, if you park in the White River Park underground parking garage. It has signs that point you in the right direction and an elevator that lets out right at the front door of the museum. The entire staff there is very courteous, helpful and friendly. 

I am not a huge art fan, but this museum kept me engaged for a bit.  Due to COVID, most of the museum's inactive exhibits were closed.  With that being said, the little ones were not entertained very much. However, they loved the Jingle Rails exhibit. The details on some of the displays in that exhibit were amazing, including Lucas Oil Stadium, the Indianapolis Speedway (with moving cars), and Monument Circle. And the trains going by all around was like wow.  Kudos to who ever puts that displays together every year.  This attraction is definitely worth the add on.

On the first floor is Jingle Rails, the Western Art Gallery, the cafe, and the gift shop. The second floor has the Mihtohseenionki (the People's Place) exhibit, a Native American, Western expansion exhibit featuring pictures, sculptures and artifacts from that era.  The second floor is also the home to my favorite exhibit, the Michael Naranjo exhibit, full of wonderful sculptures that goes against all museum etiquette and ask that you touch them. I just had to do it, because it is rare that you are able to touch any art in a museum.

The place is surprisingly big. It has two floors of exhibits and a on-site cafe. I spent a little over an hour there.  FYI, this museum is located by many other museums, as well as the zoo (all within walking distance) and could be part of a larger itinerary or package to maximize your day.",2021-01-19 01:01:44,494,2401,

We sat outside, but unfortunately, it was quite windy that day and it cooled off a bit.  Luckily, they are well equipped to handle it and instructed you to use items on the table to keep your menus from blowing away.  They also have plenty of outdoor heaters to keep you warm in the winter.

The staff seemed to follow face masks and COVID-19 protocols well.

We had a couple of appetizers, the buffalo shrimp and a flatbread which I believe was a special.  The buffalo shrimp were typical.  The flatbread was quite nice. For my entree, I had the recommended special of the evening which was scallops served on squid ink pasta with lump crap meat.  It was quite tasty.  

They have a massive drink selection.  So many drinks that it's hard to pick one.  I asked the waitress what she liked, but she could only tell me that they were all good.  With that many choices, it's hard to pick.  They had a lot of tropical style drinks with their take on thinks like pina colada and rum punches.  They had a number of rums available, but I honestly thought they would have more.

Overall I would say it was a good experience.  Depending on where you sit, it can put you pretty far away from the kitchen / bar which means sometimes it takes a while for your wait staff to get back to you.  Just paying up took a bit longer than i preferred.  Overall, a good experience though and I would go back.

If you want to make a reservation, currently you can only do it by calling.  If you are looking for a time on the weekend, you better do it in advance.  Getting a reservation same day is not going to happen.",2021-01-31 20:06:12,350,1656,

I found a photo online and asked the woman doing my pedicure if she had acrylic for my toes. She replied with ""You don't need acrylic on your toe, you have nice nail bed."" She continued and continued and i explained to her that THAT was what i and my boyfriend wanted. She followed with "" We no have acrylic for your toe"" and she INSISTED i pay extra and get gel instead on my toes. 

Personally, i don't choose to get gel on my toes bc my toes never chip as is so i would rather not pay extra (to avoid something that rarely ever happens anyway). Therefore, that was out of the question. 

Once, i realized i wasn't getting anywhere with her, i wasn't going to get what i asked for, and i didn't really see a color i liked enough to put on my toes. I told her to give me a basic pedi and and leave my toes unpainted. Which is something i would NEVER do. 

Just based off body language and tone, i could tell she was pissed off. 

I called two days later asking if they had acrylic for the toes and the ""manager"" said yes. And i proceeded to explain the issue i had with one of his employees, also explaining to him that i paid 85$ for the service and even tipped the women $10 who was aggressive, pushy, and rude and how i genuinely was not satisfied. 

That was the a big mistake. Because this MANAGER got loud with me, would not let me fully talk (without being interrupted by him) and he had the nerve to make sure i couldn't speak to the woman who did my nails. When she came up to the counter; he told her to go to the back. 

Never in my life have i ever experienced customer service like this.This manager even had other customers in the store that day (once i went to the store) trying to side with him. He never once offered the service that i was asking for. He just argued and embarrassed me in-front of everyone receiving service that day.

This pizza house has been open just a few weeks, the only staffer here to take my order & answer questions (which he couldn't) has been on staff just three days, the WINGS WERE VERY GOOD, & I'm choosing to be optimistic that everything will improve in time. (With all the small businesses lost to Covid restrictions, I'd like this one to have a chance; it takes some time before the wrinkles to be ironed out.)

Currently, new customers save 10%, but you'll need to request the savings. (I learned late.) If you want to Pick Up, you can get a Large Cheese Pizza for $9.99. Local delivery is offered w/ a $15 minimum order. The delivery charge is $1.99; delivery ends 30 minutes prior to closing. Visa, Mastercard, Discover, & American Express are accepted. 

What's on the menu @ this business that's open Tuesday thru Sunday? Nine weekly specials, as well as nine flavors of WINGS; my Garlic Butter variety (SEE PIC) was definitely DELICIOUS. (Wings range in price from $6.99 to 100 for $94.99.) However, mine were received w/ blue cheese, but not w/ the celery sticks listed on the menu. (The young man who took my order said there were no celery sticks available.) 

Also on the menu are 11 APPETIZERS @ $2.99 to $8.99; 6 SALADS ($3.49 to $9.99); 7 types of STROMBOLI @ $14.25 to $15.45; it serves 2-3 people; 5 CALZONES @ $9.99 to $14.99; 10 PASTAS w/ Garlic Knots ($8.50 to $10.50), & 1 Kids's Spaghetti @ $5.99. There are also 4 COLD SUBS ($8.49); 5 HOT SUBS ($8.49); 4 GYROS offerings @ $6.99 to $7.99; 3 BURGERS @ $6.99 to $8.99; & 7 DESSERTS ($3.99 to $5.99).

Lots of pizzas are available here! The menu states the following: ""Our dough is hand-tossed and fresh. Pies cooked directly on brick stove oven."" There are 6 WHITE PIZZAS (12"", 16"" & 18"" @ $12.99 to $21.99); NY STYLE PIZZA @ $8.99 to $13.99; & 11 GOURMET PIZZAS ($12.99 to $21.99).

I was not overly impressed w/ my 12"" Cheese pizza w/ extra sauce & extra cheese (although I was charged extra for neither). Not only was there very little sauce on my pie, but the sauce really lacked flavor. There was definitely extra cheese on my pie, & it was good-- just not great. Overall, my pie lacked the flavor I would expect from traditional NY Style pizza. After some researching, I now know that a ""brick stove oven"" uses coal. Artisan pizzas are often cooked in a brick oven, which uses wood. However, the crust was not an issue for me. Due to the sauce, I'm unsure if I'll try another pizza on my next visit. 

But I'll definitely return to reorder WINGS, which are offered in these flavors: traditional Mild, Medium, & Hot; Teriyaki; Lemon Pepper; Hot Garlic; Butter Garlic; Fresh Garlic Parm; & Volcano.

The dining room offered just 4 metal tables (due to social distancing). It was sparse, but clean. Napkins were available on each table. At this time, all beverages are in cans & bottles in a floor refrigerator-- see pic. There are NO alcoholic beverages sold here.

I wish the owners of this new business well, & I will return to reorder wings, try a burger, & eventually order a pasta, gyros, & a dessert. Still debating if I'll order another pizza.",2021-01-28 22:22:43,738,3134,

First and foremost, came here twice before once for happy hour and then again for dinner. Was so happy with it decided to try again. What they should have on their website is that they're not doing happy hour during covid as this was why my friends and I chose this place.

Despite that, still stayed and just ordered an assortment of appetizers because we were hungry. While we were waiting for food staff was actively waving a fly swatter to kill bugs. An electric one that zapped. 1)I wouldn't do that in front of customers. Not only is it not sanitary but it's off putting prior to eating. I initially let it slide because they were being proactive. 2) Is that professional? 

I really should have left after seeing that because the booth we were at had also had about 3 fruit flies on the wall. They were off putting but still negligible. 

As the wine came, more fruit flies came though. Then the food came and We were surrounded. We had to wait to get the servers attention for several minutes but were not able to as he was speaking to another worker who was drinking wine at the bar. (This is not allowed with covid)

We moved seats but the fruit flies or gnats  followed us so we wrapped it up and asked for our check. We had had enough. Although the sever was apologetic, there was no former apology from the manager. I lost my appetite, didn't finish my food, and was left embarrassed.

I had suggested this place to friends as my experiences prior were great but I will not be returning.",2021-01-05 23:46:26,348,1668,

experience.  We were hungry and excited so we arrived prior to the restaurant opening and we waited twenty minutes until it opened at 2 pm.  We were the first customers to arrive and the first customers to be seated at a hibachi table.  The table had ten chairs and we sat in the chairs facing the front of the grill.  The hostess advised us rudely that we needed to move to the side of the table just in case other customers arrive so she could fill up the table.  We moved over but we wondered why the restaurant would not be practicing ""social distancing"" because the chairs are very close.  We were served soup and salads and sodas.  About ten minutes after we arrived, ten customers were seated at a second hibachi table.  Only two hibachi tables had Customers in the entire restaurant.  Around 2:20 a hibachi chef started cooking at the table that arrived ten minutes after us.  At 2:30 pm our table still had no hibachi chef.  Our one and three year olds were hungry and getting inpatient.  We advised the hostess that we have been waiting for a hibachi chef for a half hour and we wanted to know what time someone would start cooking at out table.  We were shocked when we were told we had to wait until the chef was done cooking at the table that arrived after us and that likely the chef would not start cooking for us  until 3 pm.  This was very upsetting for us that we would need to wait an hour especially when we were the first and only customers at 2 pm when they opened.  We were not offered an apology nor an explanation except that the restaurant wants to fill the seats at the table.  This was a poor policy on a day when there were no other customers there for a hibachi table except for us and the second table.  Of course we left without service and still hungry.  Sakura in Sicklerville has poor customer service at the front door given by their rude hostess.  We will not return to this restaurant and we do not recommend going there.  They did not care that we had a hungry one and three year old.  This restaurant does not even deserve one star.  Very poor service!",2021-01-02 10:13:52,436,2199,

We ordered the sampler appetizer. Chicken tenders, mozzarella sticks, and toasted raviolis. They were decent. Not knock your socks off great but average. Typical frozen appetizers. The bread on the table was very dry. 
My husband ordered the chicken spiddini and he said it was great. 
My friend and I both ordered the fried chicken. We took a bite of the chicken breasts and it was cold. Both of our chicken breasts were ice cold. 
We returned them to the kitchen. 20 minutes later the manager returned with our plates. Some of my friend's chicken pieces were on my plate and the pieces we had eaten off of were on the plates. When we asked the manager if they just microwaved them he said they microwave it and then put it back in the fryer. ""That is what we do""
So, they took the chicken we had eaten off of and put it back in the fryer...that does not seem very sanitary. 
The table next to us left and I watched the staff one had plates and the other had a towel. The one with the towel wiped off half the table and the other out the plates down. There is salt and pepper shakers on the table that were not wiped off along with the olive oil bottles.

In my 4-5 visits to this location, since moving back to Indy 6 weeks ago I'd have to say I've been disappointed.

With each bad experience I made up an excuse for them.  ""Maybe it's because I got take out"" ""maybe it's because of covid"" ""maybe they're stressed out & understaffed"" ""maybe the ownership changed""

Yesterday after bragging about ""the best wings in town"" to 2 friends of mine, we stopped by to dine in.

What we endured would probably be my last visit to this location.  I'll have to see if the mass ave location has an issue with People of color.

The waitress seemed like she didn't want to serve us.  When we asked for beer recommendations we weren't really given any.  When we asked for a taster we had to remind her several times to bring it.  When we asked for water we had to remind her servers times to bring it.  When we did order a drink or beer (you guessed it) we had to remind her several times.

One of my friends even joked ""we're having to flag her down like a cab in New York"". It wasn't like the place was busy.  But we did notice the level of service her other tables (white folks) who were getting way better service & attention.

When our food finally came it was cold.  At this point we didn't feel like sending it back or complaining.  We just preferred to enjoy our convo & drinks that finally arrived.

I hope that the management and ownership will look into this & do better.  I'm done making excuses for a place that I don't own or make money off of.

I'm done spending my money at this place or bragging about their wings.

Hopefully the mass ave location is still A+ with service & treats ALL customers with respect.

It really sucks that in 2021, with the climate of our nation, & the stereotypes when it comes to fishers & racism that the management/ownership would even want to give ANY guest ammo to bury their business. 

If it was my business, I would be going out my way, especially in a pandemic to insure EVERY CUSTOMER had a memorable experience.

While it doesn't have everything nailed down in terms of consistency of flavor and presentation, it makes a strong statement for traditional Szechuan cuisine. They recently reopened after a lengthy renovation, and although the vibe is the same, it does appear cleaner on the dining room floor and likely in the kitchen, too. 

While food from Chengdu and Chongqing is more common here these days than it was decades ago, it remains an acquired taste for most consumers with its heavy hot chili spice and oil content. It is nothing like the sweeter Cantonese offerings found in Chinese American joints across the continent. For me the shift to preferring the numbing black peppercorns and flaming small red chillies over General Tso and the rest, came from my prolonged exposure to the kitchen heat during eight years I spent working and exploring the Middle Kingdom, primarily in Szechuan and Yunnan provinces. For me, eating this style food brings me back to the adventurous days when I became acculturated to this cooking, and loved life there. 

I would never say this is the best representation of Szechuanese cuisine in the western world, but it is damn good and satisfying. Yes, part of its attraction for me is reminiscing about the past, and they do need to use more peppercorns to capture the numbing elements of what I like most, but unless I want to travel to China to satisfy my yearnings, Szechuan House is about as good as it gets for the gestalt I seek.

My payment for my claim should arrive within 30 days.  From my conversation with Lane, he acts as a liaison for the warranty company in a sense.  He was wonderful to work with and extremely helpful! 

I purchased a home that came with a 90 day warranty with Residential Warranty Services as part of my home inspection.  Of course, this came with the opportunity to purchase a longer warranty as well.  

I had a major issue a few weeks after taking possession of the home with  what turned out to be a broken sewer line but I have been unable to get anywhere with WRS so I can get this issue fixed.  

They last emailed me for additional information on my claim on 1/2/21. I emailed them back with questions regarding the information they were looking for on 1/5/21.  I emailed again on 1/11/21 to follow up and then another email that same day sending them what I thought was what they wanted.  I followed up again on 1/15/21 via email and also called and was able to get a receptionist that transferred me to a manager, which ultimately dumped me right into their voicemail.  I have tried to call on many occasions since filing the claim only to sit on hold for way too long or to enter in my number for a call back to not get a call back or have a missed call many hours later with no voicemail (not that it would help since it's impossible to call them back anyway).

Menjiro Ramen 
2920 Calgary Trail NW

I don't know anything about Japanese cuisine. I didn't try my first piece of sushi until I was in my mid-twenties.

As a child, my knowledge of Japanese culture was limited to The Karate Kid Part II and former WWF champion Yokozuna, who wasn't even Japanese - he was Samoan. And there was this film that I've mostly forgotten, Showdown in Little Tokyo, starring Ivan Drago and Eric Draven.

As the years progressed, I found myself taking Karate classes in grade 8, earning a yellow belt before giving up because the cardio killed my fat ass. I also discovered Hentai, which never appealed to me. I prefer my pornography to be live action, with white women over the age of forty fornicating with young black men.

When adulthood came, I immersed myself in the films of auteurs Akira Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu, Seijun Suzuki, and Takashi Miike. And ever since I witnessed NJPW's trilogy of matches between Kazuchika Okada and Kenny Omega, I've wanted to visit Tokyo and attend their annual wrestling extravaganza, WrestleKingdom.

But my knowledge of Japanese cuisine and local Japanese restaurants is limited. The last time I had a Japanese dish was at Dorinku on Whyte, with my brother-in-law. It was right after a Jay-Z gig and we were inebriated. I don't vividly recall how Dorinku's food tasted, but I know we went to my childhood home afterwards and took drunken B-Boy photos next to the Nativity scene on the lawn - it was around Christmas time.

Lately, I've been eating a lot of Ramen to ease myself into Japanese cuisine. Menjiro's Goma Tan-Tan is my gateway dish as I enter the realm of Japanese food. It consists of a delicious umami-packed combination of ground pork, ground beef, and pork shoulder with egg, cabbage, and wheat noodles in a fiery broth that burns my tongue and makes my stomach rumble like Mount St. Helens, resulting in horrific craps and farts you don't want me to describe - they're just nasty.

KEY TAKEAWAYS

- FOOD- 
---The YUKATAN SHRIMP are A MUST!!  These delicious peel and eat shrimp DONE RIGHT. You can get 1/2 or a full lb (15.95/28.95 - 1/2 lb is surprisingly enough to share between 2 people) of their shrimp (large & shell on) cooked in this delicious butter/garlic/lemon sauce with a kick. Sauce is good enough to drink and there is plenty for dipping (bread provided with this dish). I asked for more bread to sop up all of the saucy goodness. 

---NE CLAM CHOWDER- Good but not great. Was nice on a cold day but probably wouldn't get this again. A small cup was 4.95. 

---GROUPER TACOS - These were on special and while I didn't try them, they looked delicious and my friend really enjoyed them with some sweet potato fries.  

---Prices were overall decent considering there is a premium for the ambiance and location. 

- LIVE MUSIC - Outside every Saturday - one guy with a great voice - soft rock-ish vibe but sang everything from backstreet boys to Ed Sheerin to Oasis. He was awesome and said he's there every Saturday. 

- COVID- All staff wearing masks but people were PACKED IN to tables inside and upper level outside so beware!  We asked to be moved from upper level outside (where your chair is inches from the next table behind you) to sit on the lower level, where tables were more spread out and live music was playing.  It was brunch on a Saturday, but I really do wish they reduced capacity and spread tables out a bit more.",2021-01-10 00:02:20,317,1550,

Can't say enough good things about their food. Single-handedly some of the best nachos we've had anywhere. I'm referring to the traditional nachos on tortilla chips, mind you - not their separate offering of the Idaho nachos on potatoes (which also sounded tasty). The platter of nachos we received was HUGE, definitely enough of an appetizer for easily 4-6 people. The chips themselves were thin, crispy, and quite flavorful. They definitely weren't bland, boring, bagged tortillas just thrown on the plate! The chicken ""tinga"" pieces were insanely good, packed with flavor, and sliced super thin. SO TASTY. They also had a delicious crema and some of the most fresh/flavorful veggies we've had topping our nachos. Could have used just a tiny bit more cheese, but even without - still some of the best nachos we could ask for anywhere. Our main entrée of the Chicken Toscana was excellent also! Super tender, flavorful and seasoned chicken breasts coated in a buttery, white wine sauce paired with delicious string beans and garlic mashed potatoes. YURM. We left SO full.

Service was top notch too! Our server (Ashleigh, I think) was awesome and came around just enough to check on us, but not too much that we felt hounded and not too little that we felt abandoned. Super willing to help and wanted us to enjoy our experience.

Price points are better than Five Guys because they have 1) $2.99 combo that adds fries/drink (for some reason not on the menu, but the master chef shared this with me) and 2) the regular fry price is several $s cheaper, but still more fries than one individual can finish 

Fries: Excellent...made fresh for my visit, so piping hot...and so good I spent the first five minutes just eating fries before getting into the burger.  Did I say HUGE portion!  The price of $2.29 is higher than what shows on the one menu picture in Yelp, but is way worth it for the amount of fries two could easily share and be happy...

Burger:
I had the single, which is similar in size to Five Guys.  Lot of condiment choices.  Three cheese (American, provolone & pepper jack) to choose from for an extra 50 cents.  Above average for a fast food establishment.

Drink machine is open and offers many Coca Cola choices; along with Gold Peak tea 

Plenty of seating; including a umbrella covered picnic table outside.  Big TV inside that was playing Netflix with subtitles....and the current music on the quality speakers was perfect.

This place opened in August 2020 and you should really try it.  I walked almost a mile round trip for lunch and it didn't disappoint.

I may be mistaken, but it seemed like Smoke was closed through some of the hell-fire that was 2020, but we figured out recently that they were open for take-out again and immediately put them at the top of our list for weekly-takeaway. 

Ladies and gents, switching to take-out hasn't marred the perfection that is Smoke BBQ one bit. EVERYTHING was delicious. 

In lieu of mac & cheese we opted to try some chicken nachos. Now I am a skeptic about ordering nachos outside of a bar or a Mexican restaurant. Honestly, these were only ok for me: the sauces and chips were delightful, but the chicken was lacking in substance a bit. The rest of the meal was so dang good though, I can't let the my tough nacho-judging ways knock a star from this review. 

Last year I was unable to try the chicken wings as they were sold-out on the evening we went, and now I know why. OH MY GOODNESS. These jumbo, meaty, finger-licking glories are delightful. I went with the hot rub/sauce at the recommendation of the kind man who took my order and it was not a regret. The sauce was a nice slow-burn, but not enough to make you regret everything. 

My partner went back to his beloved brisket with a side of slaw and cornbread, and was happy to report that it was perfect yet again. They are offering sauce to go, and he opted for the classic espresso sauce we highlighted in my last post and the new ghost pepper sauce.  He was surprised by how much he enjoyed the ghost pepper sauce, with it being a formidable peppery flavor. Luckily, like my hot wings, it wasn't too much to cause pain. 

Let me tell you, our food was ready and hot in 10 minutes. TEN MINUTES. My partner ran in to pick it up for us, and the first words out of his mouth when he came back to the car::

So first off, my husband and I love us some pizza that we normally get it once a week.  Our go to favorite pizza is in St. Pete and we have been on the hunt to find one by our house and Bro's is our go to now!  We don't even order from any other pizza place and thankfully this is not only semi close to our house but also is on the way home when hubby leaves work at the hospital.  Bro's has been out solid choice for over a year now & we keep coming back for more.  So on with the food review...

If you need a little appetizer to go with your pizza then you have got to order the GARLIC KNOTS! In fact, if you don't order garlic knots with your pizza something might be wrong with you...but it's never too late to start!  Garlic knots are 5/5 and the size of them is enough for one but you'll eat two...maybe even three because that's how good they are.  Don't want to load up on carbs before you eat pizza?  No problem, we have also tried the stuffed mushrooms and the meatballs and again 5/5.  

Now pizza...Bro's Special!  This is the first ""supreme"" type pizza where we don't have to substitute any toppings.  Perfect combo of toppings to give you a little taste of everything.  We have passed down our pizza taste buds to our daughter who is a lover of the pie as well.  You can't go wrong with their classic cheese.  Now one pizza I would have never ordered myself but was able to try it when we actually ate in with family was their Philly Cheese Steak pizza.  SO GOOD!! Everyone in our party actually ended up eating it and agreed it was a nice surprise.  I did think it needed some kind of dressing or sauce with it (we love to do Italian dressing or oil and vinegar over our steak subs which is what I thought would have been the cherry on top for the pizza for me) but I was the only one out of party of 6 that thought so. 

If you dine in, the parking lot is pretty small if you are going during dinner hours however, they are located next to a smaller sized strip mall that has additional parking.  My next items which we are going to order tonight for dinner is the steak and cheese sub and hopefully I can convince hubby to try the white pizza with me.  Based on how we've liked everything else from here, I am pretty sure we will be happy with these options as well.",2021-01-30 23:28:06,529,2429,

There is no veterinary care quite like that which your pet will receive at 2nd Street. For several months we've been trying to figure out the cause of mysterious symptoms in my very small, deaf, mini-lop rabbit. 2nd Street not only figured it out immediately but they are also the world's sweetest, calmest and most caring staff of nurses, administrators and doctors. 

Now for the real sign that the nursing and administrative staff are human angels: This morning I arrived to drop off my rabbit for surgery. Upon leaving, a man was frantically running down the street carrying a dog. While screaming ""my dog is dying"" and crying, knocking on the door the nurses ran over to assist him while still trying to follow their office's Covid policies (no entry). They took in the dog, locked the door, and let the owner watch through the glass as they dislodged a stick from the bleeding dog's mouth, as if it was effortless. They saw us trying to keep the man calm so they did the same for the dog then gave him back to the owner with the following sentiment: ""your dog is okay! She's calm now and we just want to make sure you're okay; we are so sorry for yelling but we just wanted to make sure the dog didn't dart out of the door because she was scared. You're all going to be okay."" They saved the dog's life FOR FREE, and this man's. He was on his knees, hysterical, (as anyone would be) and 2nd Street revived him. I am so grateful for these amazing women and I don't think an argument exists for a better vet.

My husband and son love chick-fil-a. I'm a fan too, but never a big enough one to drive to pick it up. The closest chick-fil-a is about a 15 minute drive, which is about 10 minutes too long for me to get fast food. My husband called the other day and asked if I wanted anything because, like always, him and the toddler were picking up chick-fil-a. I asked for a small, vanilla iced coffee not thinking much of it. 

Yes, they have coffee. This was surprising to almost everyone I spoke with.

Fast forward and after eating most of my son's fries and chicken nuggets (which is why I never have to order anything), I was drinking my iced coffee and realized it was delicious. They have it without the vanilla flavor, but I really liked the added spin. It's a bit more expensive (like $1) than other fast food coffee, but I think it is worth it. 

The next day I was craving this coffee so I decided that I would drive myself to get it. It was 2:30 p.m. so who is getting food then anyways? Apparently the world. Ok, I exaggerate, but the line of cars was wrapped twice around the building. 

I called my husband, enraged, that he didn't warn me that the line would be so long. I just drove 15 minutes to sit in a line to get an iced coffee? My husband assured me that the line actually moves really quickly. 

There were two people walking down the line taking orders. One was taking payment and the other you paid when you got closer. There were also people walking to deliver the orders to cars. It was incredible to see. I love organization and efficiency and this was really impressive. 

I go to Dunkin Donuts where there are four cars in front and it probably takes longer than it took to make it fifteen cars deep. Don't be deterred by the long line.

The only reason I'm docking a star is the second coffee was a lot weaker than the first one. It tasted a bit watered down. I'm glad or else I'd be driving 15 minutes for iced coffee.",2021-01-05 18:19:58,438,2015,

Their employee who answered my call looked up my dog's chart and stated that since he didn't need any other inoculations or medications until March, I could simply bring him in for the rabies injection only, and the price would be $30.00. She very helpfully provided me with an appointment for this for the very next day, yesterday, January 5, 2021, at 3:30 PM. I did not take note of this employee's name, as I didn't think that making a vet appointment warranted that much drama - oh, how wrong I was! At the 1/5 appointment, their tech took my dog into their building, and brought him back to our car no more than 6 minutes later. She then presented me with a bill for over $101.00! I expressed shock and dismay at this, telling her that I had been quoted $30.00 the previous day; she informed me that it is their policy that in order to give a pet any kind of medication or inoculation, the pet must have had a check-up by their office within the past THREE months (despite the fact that the state law only requires the pet to have been seen within the past YEAR). She offered to have the office manager call me; after waiting about 5 minutes for this call, my husband and I decided to leave and just mail a check. I later called them to let them know I'd be mailing a check for the amount I was quoted. The same tech happened to answer the phone and stated to me that the office manager had been on his/her way outside to speak with me, but we ""peeled out"" before he/she could get our attention. I take extreme offense to this accusation; my husband, an insurance claims adjuster for over 35 years, was driving, and he never, ever, ""peels out"" of anywhere. Further, he paused at the end of their driveway to wave to a pedestrian he knows. I find this entire experience unacceptable, unprofessional, and quite possibly illegal.

When we first moved in things were great our ac went out a couple of times but was fixed fairly quickly and they explained to us it was just Bc the ac hadn't been turned on in a while due to them remodeling the unit. then we noticed the washing machine leaked when we tried to run it with cold water so we put in another work order, it took 6 months and 3 different maintenance people just for the last guy to tell us not to use the cold water Bc he doesn't know how to fix it. Not only do our clothes sometimes shrink but we are located above the model unit and the first two maintenance guys told us that this has a good chance of flooding the model unit if not fixed soon. I don't know why this doesn't cause concern to them but that's besides the point. Recently ever since we signed our renewal lease more and more issues have arose. Our dishwasher has been broken for 4 months I have put in multiple work orders and called numerous times, I know a dishwasher is not an emergency maintenance issue and I really try to be respectful to them being busy since I too work in customer service but I don't think it should take 4 months to fix or at least come look at it. On New Year's Eve morning our ac went out and I called to put in the work order instead of doing it on the computer like I usually do. Because it was higher than 86 degrees outside the order was classified as an emergency, it's been 4 days now and I haven't heard anything yet. Our apartment has been at 80 degrees the whole time and I am losing my mind. I have two dogs who are miserable Bc of the heat and I also deal with extreme anxiety and claustrophobia and between the heat and the stress of everything breaking it is causing me to have a mental breakdown. I recently logged into the residential portal to see an update on my work orders when I saw they have marked my dishwasher orders as being completed. I work from home so I know no one has stopped by and it is in fact still broken. I am at a complete loss of words as if I put another work order in for the dishwasher it will be put at the bottom again. I have talked to office staff and they seem very nice I think the issue is maintenance. I see maintenance drive around on their golf carts all day long but never see them do any work. They play around racing golf carts and while walking my dogs through the children's playground one of the maintenance golf carts comes driving through full speed running over kids toys that were laying near the swings. When u do actually get maintenance to stop by your apartment most of the time they don't know how to fix the issue.

Is the service good? Above and beyond - friendly staff, always very helpful, and they care about the community.

What's up with the kielbasy? AMAZING - they have a great variety of options, from smoked, to garlic, to jalapeno popper. They get creative, and the quality is always there. 

Is it only sausage? Nope - great spot to snag some homemade pierogies, or any other traditional polish fixings like sauerkraut or spicy mustard.

The environment wasn't inviting and poorly lit with horrible light rock 90's music playing in the background. Could barely see the menu. Now, the food. I will give them that the Scottish eggs were on point and very good. That's the end of good. My entire entree of Bangers & Mash was served COLD. The peas weren't cooked or flavored. The sausages looked like Eckrich Farms store bought, cold and tasteless just sitting on the plate looking sad. The mashed potatoes had no flavor, parts were crunchy, hard and lumpy with congealed cold gravy plopped on top. Literally, looked like gel and tasted worse. Seeing the theme here cold and tasteless. I called the waitress to tell her the entire dish was cold and not eatable. I asked for a different entree. No apology or concern just took it and said ok. I ordered the meatloaf. Mistake! Same disgusting potatoes, barely cooked, flavorless veg medley. Oh but, I did get a tiny pat of butter that wouldn't melt on the cold veggies. The meatloaf was smothered in some kind of watered down ketchup sauce, which I scraped off because there was too much and gross. The meatloaf was mushy, sliced thinly, zero flavor and lukewarm at best. If there was pork, turkey and beef in it, as described, I could taste none. My friend had fish and chips.

I have been to St Al's urgent care on Emerald and they are good, but nothing compares to the care that I received on Parkcenter. Over the past couple of holiday weekends, I had some concerns. I was trying to follow up with my problem at St Luke's, but they were closed for New Years. They took pretty good care of me. The next closest clinic was either Primary Health (who I hate) and St Al's. 
In my history with St Al's in Boise I have always been in great hands. They have taken care of me in the emergency room on Eagle and in their urgent care facilities. So, we have a pretty good relationship. So, why should I be reluctant to contact the one here? 
I called and they said that they were closing soon, but eveidently she was listening and asked more questions and said that the nurse will need to contact me or I can come over. I decided to go since I didn't want to feel stressed out until Monday. These guys have such a positive and patient attitude. When I arrived I called and she said, yes I can see you come on in. 
I got to speak with the nurse who instantly put me at ease. Then Dr. Weese came in and he was just as awesome. These two are such a great duo. In fact, I have never had this type of treatment before and it was really relieiving. 
The nurse made a huge effort to get me a scrip even though the pharmacies were closed. Also, Dr. Weese provided the best reason why I should have a primary health care provider. I would have someone that I could trust to go to. Since my visit St Al's called me and got me set up with a referal. Again, nobody has ever done this for me before! Yes, yes, I will talk to this primary doctor. 
I have never liked going to any doctors because I am typically treated like my concerns do not matter. Here, my concerns mattered a great deal.

I have two sets of tires for my 2013 Camaro: one performance set for summer, and an all season tires for the rest of the year. Both sets are exact manufacturer recommended size, both mounted on two identical OEM recommended wheels. The set is staggered -- 10 in wheels in the front, 11 in wheels in the back. Tires are the same size on both axles. 

The all season tires are about 2 years old, and I maybe have 15k miles on them. They were fine when I removed them in June this year. Since it's the fall again, I swapped the sets about a month ago to all season tires, obviously, and felt a small vibration on the steering wheel in the range of 55-75 mph speeds on a highway. I thought that the wheels needed a little balancing, so I stopped by Pep Boys and dropped off the car. 

About 45 minutes later I get a call from PB, saying they couldn't balance the wheels. I was told that the wheels were so bad, they couldn't balance them at all without multiple ounces of weights. Hm, I thought, it shouldn't be that bad, but perhaps I really do need to replace the tires, who knows. But whatever, I'll come and pick up the car, and then we'll see. 

About 10 minutes later I get another call from PB telling me the front wheel locked up ton the brake caliper. What? That shouldn't happen, after all I drove the car normally to the PB. The guy told me they will investigate what's happening. 

Another 15 minutes later I receive one more call, -- and I was told that to Pep Boys' surprise they have learnt that my wheels are in different size! So they installed a wider rear wheel to the front axle, and of course it didn't fit there. But who cares, right? They even tried to drive the car this way! So yes, naturally they have scratched a coilover, and chipped a brake caliper. Yup, they had no idea that the wheels were staggered, even though I specified my exact car model in their database. Apparently their car database does not contain this information, so I wonder what else they do not know about your cars? 

Oh, and also they scratched up the inner part of the rim while installing a ton of weights but I'll get to that later. 

A technician then spent about 15 minutes over the phone arguing with me that I have the wrong size wheels and tires on my car, even though I know for a fact that it's 100% exact OEM wheel size and the only recommended tire size for both axles. At some point I just gave up and decided to pick up the car, and solve this issue somewhere else. 

But on the way home I immediately felt that the car has become completely undriveable above 40miles -- huge vibration in the steering wheel first and then the whole car would shake like crazy. Honestly I wasn't sure I'd make it home even though it's less than 5 miles from Pep Boys. 

But luckily I've made it home, took off the front wheel, removed the weights installed by Pep Boys, and installed my own eights in the spots where previous weight were - boom, the car is back to some minor vibration on highway speeds. Thanks for making things worse, Pep Boys! Hey, at least they didn't charge me for this BS. Nevermind the scratched wheel, caliper and a coilover, of course. 

And as a cherry on top of that when I got home I couldn't find a security lug nut key in my console. At first I thought Pep Boys forgot to put it back in the car, but it's actually worse! They left the lug nut secret key in the nut on a wheel, and didn't tell me about it! So I drove home with it in the wheel, and it's just a miracle it wasn't lost, and stayed in the nut. Otherwise it would be another adventure to remove it and buy another set of lug nuts. 

So yes, thanks for nothing and for making things worse, Pep Boys. I gave you a chance to show you are worth considering as a service, and you blew it so hard, that I will stay away from Pep Boys forever. And it was just a simple wheel balancing procedure, I can't even imagine how you can screw up anything bigger than that.",2021-01-02 21:04:50,891,4060,

 I have just visited your place and it seems we both share a fond liking for unique sweet treats.  My forte is normally a cake but from today on...when I want ice cream, I will put you in my top spot!  

First things first, I've never been to your establishment and I mistakenly got into the pick up line and not the drive thru line. For a newbie, maybe I should've read the Yelp reviews for instruction (but I didn't want to be swayed both others opinions) so I blindly got in ""line"".  Could the front door have a neon sign tell us new folks the process please??

Secondly, upon driving up, our kind attendant was lovely. He told us the process and more than made up for our failed blunder!  He let us know the flavors and even gave us a few recommendations.  We drove around to our spot for pick up thinking about how nice he was!  Our choices: fruity pebbles ice cream sandwich with strawberry cheesecake ice cream and brownie milkshake with brownie pieces.  HELLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOO. HOW YOU DOIN? This was like I got slapped in the face with goodness. 

My item was the fruity pebbles ice cream sandwich.  Why God why haven't I made rice crispy treats with fruity pebbles?? TeeJay, you are a genius. The strawberry cheesecake ice cream had chunks of cheesecake and strawberries. (Eh hem..not little baby pieces but recognizable yummy bits). I tried to take a bite while driving home and decided to pull over and finish my delightful sandwich. The sweetness fruit flavor of the fruity pebbles and the fruity ice cream complimented one another perfectly. I would definitely order that again. 

The brownie milkshake was my daughter's. It was chocolatey and had nice (again) CHUNKS of brownies in it. We talked about how they probably bake brownies and chop them up to add. While I am not sure this actually happens, they were fresh and awesome.  She chose to have the brownie pieces mixed and topped. The straw they provide is a great tube to ensure each sip is rewarded. 

So in closing, TeeJay, I am thankful for your sweet tooth.  We will be back to explore your other treats!  Thank you!",2021-01-04 01:18:19,433,2102,

Ask not what your Country can do for you, but what you can do for your country - I can eat. That's what I can do. I get my lashes done bi weekly nearby and I came today under the assumption that I was going to try Chinese. I lied. I left my appointment and saw this cute little place so I decided to try Curbside Takeout. 

The online ordering experience was nice. No complaints here, but if I was to offer a word of feedback I would add the ability to add an extra kabob, because obviously I'm a glutton and I need my grilled chicken gains.

It was still warm when I got home (4 miles) and rushed past my kids with my contraband takeout while they had to eat food from home because that's just who I am as a parent. Also they're teenagers with their own jobs and money and I don't see them bringing me anything home from Burger King so I don't feel any guilt. 

My. Kabobs. Were. Awesome. I got the combo with steak and chicken. The chicken was moist and flavorful. I got some tzatziki (I don't know how to spell it, sorry), rice and pita with it. Total price was like $15 after tax. A bit pricey but I feel great after eating it unlike most takeout so I'm considering this a win. I will absolutely be back, probably bi weekly and will just work this into my lashes budget. I'm already planning on trying some hummus and lemon cookie next time.",2021-01-26 23:48:46,354,1569,

After getting a number of bids I chose East Fork Roofing because of their fair bid and efficiency with getting their bid to me -- which as others have noted was very detailed. 
 I chose a September date (at the cost of an additional fee) in an effort to avoid any problems that the faulty materials might cause as fall and winter weather approached.  Unfortunately, my HOA insisted that I chose a more ""elegant"" roofing material and the date ended up being pushed to November due to a need to obtain a ""blessing""  from the HOA before getting a building permit.  I ended up with a shingle that was substantially more expensive -- but at NO TIME did East Fork and their representatives try to upsell me.  It was quite the opposite, they even provided additional documentation to my HOA in an attempt to demonstrate that the original shingle I chose met all of their criteria.    
When the day to install my roof approached so did our Northern Nevada wonderful wet and windy weather. East Fork was careful to only remove part of the roof as the first rain/wind event approached.  They were unable to work for several days due to high winds -- but still came out to make sure that everything remained covered.  Once the weather calmed down they worked steadily to make sure my roof went on in a timely manner.  Each day all debris was picked up and discarded in the trailer that they parked in my driveway.  East Fork kept me updated with constant reports and photos of the progress.  
Remember the additional fee that I had agreed to so my  project could start in September? East Fork waived that fee (I ended up spending the money on a couple of upgrades -- again my choice not theirs).  The roof looks fabulous and I cannot say enough nice things about the entire team, their professionalism and attention to detail.  
So, the roof has been completed for almost two months. I have paid my bill and been in contact with the company regarding a warranty claim I made about the original faulty materials. Again, East Fork has been more than helpful as I try to reclaim part of my loss  as the original roof was supposed to be a 40 year shingle.  Today they sent a quality inspector to make sure that everything they installed is working as it should. 
This is a company that not only takes pride in their work but is also concerned about customer satisfaction.  I would highly recommend them for any of your roofing needs.",2021-01-08 04:13:35,497,2559,

Management and staff did not seem to care  AT ALL. In fact, a manager actually tripped over me in a crowd of people and knocked me into a Christmas tree and then kept walking. 

Our room was lovely and appeared clean upon check in. However, despite opting in to housekeeping services, we hardly received it. Our first full day, I inquired around 3:20 to see if housekeeping would be coming because we wanted to make sure we weren't the room, and they hadn't come yet. I was told someone would check on it but heard nothing back. They knocked on our door at 6pm and told us that we had to leave so that they could clean our room. The lobby and hotel bars were completely full, so we waited by the pool for about 30 minutes even though it was frigid out. Came back to our room - no housekeeping had been done, and they did not come back. Second day we left our room around 3pm and they had not been by, but when we returned that evening there had been a quick tidy and bed making. Our last day they knocked on the door around 9am to inquire if we wanted the room cleaned - even though we were checking out at 12.

Would love to have grabbed a drink from the Sazerac, even to go, but the entire time we were there, there was a massive line to get in. Again, most of those people were not hotel guests. It would have been really nice if they had prioritized actual hotel guests. 

The one good thing was that we got to spend some nice time in the hot tub, which was our main reason for coming. Unfortunately on our second day, the hot tub had been drained and was half empty. We tried coming back later in the day and although the water was higher, the hot tub wasn't functioning. We were able to get back in later that night, although the water was still low. 

Plus - the housekeeping staff was incredibly pleasant. Every time we passed them in the halls, they greeted us warmly. 

Seriously though, there appeared to be absolutely zero care given to hotel guests with regard to Covid safety or the ability to actual enjoy hotel amenities.",2021-01-01 00:03:21,490,2339,

So here it is the good and the bad. First, our server was a little disorganized and sometimes not available but was pleasant and hard working and the food was good both the sushi and the small plates were flavorful. I missed them not having a small ginger salad on the menu though and they would not make one.They also were not good at altering their menu as I asked for a couple of changes to my order and it came out basically the way it was on the menu minus one of the changes I requested. I asked for simple changes like dressing on the side which they did not execute and I didn't bother to correct it as I didn't want to wait again for my order. Things also arrived from the kitchen in a spastic order with no real rhyme or reason. In addition,the outdoor seating is appreciated but it can be loud and there may be a homeless person or two roaming around and asking for assistance as you eat. Nothing is done when this happens and with covid it can be a problem if you or the other person are outside and not masked. They were not masked. If you have more than 6 in your party the policy and training issues surface. If more than six you will pay upfront a $100 deposit for the privilege of getting a secured reservation or you can show up and wait if you don't want to pay up. I might consider this to be o.k. if it was a high end restaurant but I would consider this a casual bar setting at best and other restaurants like BellaBrava in the area do not charge for a reservation so it's really not customary or normal for the area. The deposit will come off your bill but often they are too busy to make the reservation over the phone and it may take multiple calls to get the job done as some of the employees don't understand their policies and how to handle making the reservation. This also means that if you have some separate checks in your slightly larger than 6 party all of you will pay the mandatory 20% gratuity even if you receive less than stellar service. It can add up quick as the prices are fairly expensive for a lot of items and when you are eating sushi etc. So if you have a $450 bill for 3 checks everyone will be paying $30 for tip whether the service is good or not and the server knows that going in. In the case of good service, I am not opposed, but I still like having the ability to make my own decision about the quality of the service I receive and how to reward it. We had trouble with parking as you always do downtown and we were about 7-8 minutes late for the reservation and they were already calling us to find out where we were as well. So to sum it up the food is consistent and good, some of the policies and employee training are not customer friendly, and the prices were well above my tab at other sushi restaurants in the area with equally good food (probably around $65 higher with the 20% tip) but maybe a day with a good special might be a good choice for you. If their were a 3.5 star rating that's where it would land for me taking everything into consideration.",2021-01-05 17:46:11,630,3032,

I had eyebrows waxed and manicure with paint. She was very nice and wonderful conversation, nails were great. My eyebrows were okay, not much shape was added, but that also could be because I asked for a clean up. The next morning I woke up with extremely swollen, puffy eyes and NEVER had a reaction like this before from eyebrow wax. I DID NOT do anything different to my face that day either, my eyes were like this for 2 whole days. I reached out to her to let her know and also asking could it be an allergic reaction from the wax or the moisturizer, maybe it was something in the ingredients or what. NO response. She was quick to let me know that my venmo payment wasn't received though (which was related to having to reconnect my bank account then it was paid on same day of service). I waited days as it was the weekend then I asked again 5 days later, still no response. I would have liked to at least been acknowledged for what happened or given direction in what I could do to help with my reaction, but yet nothing. Will not return. Didn't think that was appropriate. Hope this helps.



Update: Sorry to hear you had a family emergency. It was not about a refund and it was not about making a negative review either. I understand this reaction can be normal for some, but it was of severe degree for me.  I completed the review due to my concern for my reaction and the lack of response for days. I wish you well in your practice. 
This is the response I recieved in text: ""I am going to refund your Groupon payment. I do not wish to have you come to see me again thank you."" And I did receive a reimbursement for the price of Groupon, thanks.",2021-01-08 04:54:17,379,1765,

I tend to get the southwest cobb or the kietzke sandwich, both are amazing. I've tried other menu items as well, and they are always so good! Even when I try something that I tend to stay away from, The Urban Deli reminds me to question my tastebuds every time with every experience being so pleasant and flavorful!! One outstanding service experience I had here related to a request I had called back in on a cobb salad I had ordered: I got busy at work and was unable to return for lunch for well over a month; when I did return, I didn't say anything or bring it up, was just happy to come back in for great food. Management remembered me though!! (Even from just a friendly phone call, *attention to the customers needs and wants*) And comp'd my whole meal in return. I even tried to pay, reminiscing in the fact that I'd gladly pay for their tasty meals, but they were glad to right the wrong. This has been such a treat and I, as I've always been, will be a happy returning customer. More businesses need to uphold their customer service values to these standards; it truly shows they care about their customers and their food. Genuine dedication to serving their community and making it a better one! Please give your local restaurants a try such as this one and keep their doors open! 5 stars all around!

I would not recommend Bob's to anyone!!! If I could give 0 stars, I would!

On 12/19/2020 we made our purchase of a dinning room set which included 4 chairs, a bench and a table. We really wanted the set before Christmas so we were willing to pick it up, however we were told we could not pick it up and that it had to be delivered so we were forced to pay $59.99 for a delivery fee. We scheduled for delivery on 12/31/2020 which was the soonest it could be delivered.

On the morning of 12/31/2020 I received a voicemail from a woman named Anna stating that the delivery would be here however the chairs would not be delivered. I called customer service to see what was going on with the chairs. I spoke to a man named Chris who informed me that there must have been a mistake for the phone call because everything including the chairs would be delivered. After getting off the phone with Chris I still wasn't 100% confident that the set would be delivered in full so I called back. I spoke to Angie who also said not to worry - everything will be delivered together. Well, Our delivery came and the team did not have the chairs. I then called customer service yet again. After being on the phone for an hour and speaking to an associate and a supervisor (Michaela) I was told that there was nothing that could be done about it but I request would be put in for it to be delivered on 1/2/2021 I was told it should not be a problem because it is not an entire sectional it is just chairs and the bench that they are replacing because it was damaged. I was told that if it could not be delivered today the soonest delivery would be 1/7/2021. They told me I would be notified first thing in the morning and yet I never got a call confirming when the new delivery will be. I called customer service and spoke to a supervisor who was a woman named Michelle she informed me that there's nothing they can do about it it will not be delivered today and it will be delivered on the 7th. I told her that I need to return the whole thing because we have four children which now we can't eat at the table together or at all two of the children are doing virtual school and sit at the kitchen table to do their schoolwork. Now what are we supposed to do sit on the floor? This was not even our first choice the first choice of the dining room set that we really liked would not be available until mid/late January according to the sales associate (Todd) so we went with our second choice. Now we have no chairs,a damaged bench and a table that is not doing us any good since we can't even sit at it. I told the supervisor Michelle I would like to just return everything so that I can purchase something else that will be useful to me and my family that I would be able to take home today and have set up for the kids for school and for our family to have meals at and she gave me an attitude saying ""if you look on the back of your receipt you will see once the delivery is made all sales are final and no returnable"". I'm totally disappointed in Bob's and will NEVER order from them again.

So this review is not for the actual tea itself, but the establishment.  The hubs looked this place up and said it was supposedly the ""best"" -rated  boba shop in Santa Barbara, or at least State St.  I don't know about that.  Maybe State St, and because boba is such a scarcity in these parts, it's the only boba shop on State St. Can you really call it the best if it's the only game in town? So after biking 4 miles from the hotel to the wharf, past some hat shops, and finally up to  this boba place, we went in. There are electronic kiosks to order your drink in addition to the walk-up counter. Definitely no social distancing going on or any enforcement of this, and there were greasy fingerprints all over the kiosk touchpad screens. Not sure how often they disinfect the kiosks, if at all, being that they are high-touch surfaces.The walls are painted turquoise.  They have all kinds of local art on the walls.  I asked what kind of  tea they used in the house milk tea, which is always my measure of a solid tea house. The bleached blonde surfer kid at the counter gave me a blank stare....""Uhhh what kinda tea?  Uhhmm.. I'm not sure let me check....Hey, what kinda tea is in the house milk tea?"" he shouted out, to I assume, a co-worker?   Crickets. So he disappeared into the kitchen and 5 minutes later, re-emerged with the tea. He shoved the bag in my face and said ""This one. This is the tea we use.""  It said ""Dragon golden tea"" on the bag. Ok, I get that they trained you to use the cash register and not to know the product or even how to make the tea. But this has that grassy herby flavor that is totally not my cup of tea. Pun intended.  I usually prefer Assam or oolong as the black tea, which they did not have, and so I didn't order. Maybe next time.",2021-01-14 23:31:37,409,1824,

I'd still opt out of the satay hotpot option as it lacks flavor, but here are some other good dishes:

Korean Army Stew - Based on the ingredients, I thought this stew seemed too simple to spend money on eating out, but when it comes to a rainy day after classes and you just can't seem to find the energy to cook anything... This Korean Army Stew is a godsend. The portion is quite big (I shared it with someone else). The spicy Korean soup and the oozing cheese go so well together. The thick noodles were made for slurping. Overall a great comfort meal!
Chicken Cheese - I'd like to commend whoever discovered the combination of meat and cheese. This thick, sweet-and-spicy chicken sizzling plate was delicious! We ate it with hot jasmine rice.
Beef Sizzling Plate - The sizzling plate reminds me of Sizzling Lunch or Pepper Lunch but with more variety. I loved the corn and broccoli. The amount of sauce they give mixes very well with the rice. I ended up with a rice stir-fry of sorts. They also give an egg yolk.
Szechuan Hotpot - This is the flavor that I'd go for with hotpot here. It's spicy but not overly so that your entire mouth feels numb. It warms you up and the amount of toppings is great. I think all the meat options go well with it.

All in all, I'm happy that Uniboil is here to stay in SB. It's convenient that the store connects to a boba shop. In a place where Asian food and flavors are so hard to come by, Uniboil offers a variety of flavors and exciting options!",2021-01-17 06:05:25,347,1624,

We decided to give this place a try. At first, they looked like they could be open or closed. Not sure which, and different online sites conflicted as well. There weren't many cars in the lot and not much light was visible from outside. To be honest, we suspected the parked cars were from patrons across the street. Also, there were coverings all on the outdoor furniture.  That gave us the impression they might really be closed during COVID.

So, in we went to see for ourselves. They were, in fact, open and there was absolutely no wait!  It's a good thing too for we were famished. The place looked nice outside (albeit at night) and inside too. The service was just fine. Prices were on par for the area and cuisine, maaaaybe just a little higher. Now let's talk about food details.  The food looked pretty nice, but the actual taste was...well, I'll give you details. The red salsas offered with the chips had a strong tomato sauce taste to them.  I had the Carne asada chimichanga (Not combo). The amount of guacamole and sour cream on the plate was tiny. The guacamole had large chunks of tomato and maybe other stuff too, and lacked avocado flavor, for my liking.  The steak inside was cut up into very small pieces, cooked quit Well done, and it seemed a small ratio of meat to tortilla, in my opinion. On a plus side, the meat was not tough to chew due to its small size and had absolutely no gristle or fat in it.  The tortilla was quite nice and fresh tasting.  The pico de gallo served on the side was okay as well.  My husband had the Carne asada burrito combo platter. He felt his meat portion was appropriate. It did not come with guacamole or sour cream, just rice and beans, which he said were ""average"".  

Overall, we feel the food, while definitely good enough to eat, but comparatively, just average.  On the flip side of that statement, I would never be afraid to go there again.  I would definitely be willing to give it 1-2 more tries to improve my opinion.",2021-01-11 04:44:03,455,2127,

Our son had been cooped up in the house the entire pandemic and we wanted to make his birthday special for he and his friends. We reserved a birthday package with a birthday host a week ahead of time. The big day finally comes. We arrived 15 minutes early to ensure that all waivers were signed ahead of the time of our party. Our hostess pointed us in the direction of our party room and she didn't direct us any further. Our hostess never walked us back to the room, she said that she would be late (because she was hosting another party), and did not give us any other instructions. The party was supposed to start at 3:30 pm and she said that was unavailable until 4:00 pm. At 4:10 pm, we still did not have a hostess so I went to customer service to ask for assistance. I explained the entire situation, I even told the manager that I didn't know when everything was going to begin, when we would receive assistance, or when we would receive our food. The manager took our food order, again,  (even though we already reserved our food order prior to the event) and he stated that the food would come at 4:30 pm, and we would be called over the intercom. That never happened. The hostess came back at 4:30 pm to ask me if we knew that we should be seated, I told her no, so I went to gather everyone, we never received an intercom announcement. The hostess was non engaging, not friendly, didn't wish my son a happy birthday. She only passed out the pizza and poured drinks. She left the room and never came back until 5:15 pm. to tell us that the room closed at 5:30 pm and to ask us if we paid our bill in full. Our party didn't begin on time. The hostess and staff weren't warm. The hostess only joined us when it was time to serve and never came back but to tell us when we had to leave.

My engine light had come on last week and, after getting the code readout from AutoZone, they were able to fix that with a new part within a day of me dropping it off at a fair price. The next day the engine light came on again and when I got the readout at AutoZone it was a slightly different code this time and Zach told me to just drop it off to them again. Turns out it was another issue that cropped up in the same system as the previous one so they replaced the whole canister--this time for free! I was shocked, needless to say, as I didn't expect that extra work and parts to be free of charge. 

While it was a tumultuous time with my car going back and forth, it was only because one never expects to be without their car. It would've been the same at another mechanics or the Dealership, it would've probably taken longer and DEFINITELY would've cost more money. Zach and his crew were very nice, gave me rides back to my house when needed, told me what was going on in layman's talk and NOT condescend to me just because I'm not a mechanic myself, told me how much it was expected to be before actually doing the work and getting the approval of me first, and I really appreciated all of it!

Easy to find on corner of two main streets. Some parking street side and plenty of parking behind the complex.

We were greeted and seated right away, socially distanced. Drink orders were taken while we perused the menu. My wife opted to try the Buffalo Cauliflower Bites and Buffalo Chicken sandwich. The Bites came hot and crunchy, but with little heat. Buffalo Chicken sandwich was huge and very tasty.

Since there was a $1 each special on Steamed Oysters, how could I not try six. They were nice sized, perfectly shucked and no grit. Fabulous! My only complaint was the tray did not come with horseradish. Hmmm. That was always a given I thought? However it quickly came when requested.

And because there was also a special on an Oyster Platter, no choice but to get that, although there were several great choices on the menu. The fried oysters came, hot & crispy, in a huge stack. I did need to request tartare sauce, another given? Oysters were a bit disappointing. Though the batter was tasty, there was just too much of it. The oysters were lost in all the breading. If I order in the future I will definitely ask for light dusting and flash frying.

Now, the hit of the meal was definitely the French Fries! Large cuts snd perfectly fried. These were absolutely the BEST Fries I have EVER tasted. So hot and crispy outside and moist and tender inside. I hesitated to share with my wife but did so, just so she could enjoy also.

Waitress was excellent, I would just advise checking for desired condiments when your food is delivered to prevent having to delay delivery.

We'd dined on the patio before and enjoyed it, but it was too crowded for our comfort level, so this time we called in an order to go.  We were told our order would be ready in 20 minutes.  We arrived to pick it up.  Once we finally could track down someone to ask where to pick up orders (how about a host area?), they returned several minutes later and told us it would be another 10 minutes.  No apology.  She took my credit card.  Despite the bad service, I included a tip for the to-go order.  Ok, I think--they're new, and obviously not well staffed and made an inaccurate estimate for when the food would be ready.  So instead of a 20 minute wait, it looked like it was going to be a 30 minute wait.  I can be forgiving. 

I'm waiting outside in the cold (not prepared with a jacket I was just picking up a to-go order), watching lots of people coming in, seeing them wander around inside and out for where to check-in, the lobby inside is getting pretty full of people standing around, without the required distancing.  30 minutes comes and goes, and I'm trying to find someone to check on my long-overdue to-go order.  Finally, I find a server who goes to check on it, tells me it will be a few more minutes.  I was clearly not happy, as servers came and went by me, knowing I had been waiting outside a long time.  Finally, a guy rushes by and I catch his eye.  ""How you doing?"" he asks me.  He's the manager.  ""Not well,"" I reply and explain how long I've been waiting: the 20 minute promise, the additional 10 minute promise, and the fact that I've been waiting another 15 minutes after that.  He seems irritated at me and says he'll go find my food.  

5 minutes later he comes back with my food, again no apology.  I told him it was not an acceptable wait time (25+ minutes after the 20 minutes they told me).  A good manager of a restaurant would say something like ""I'm so sorry.  We're new and obviously not prepared.  We're understaffed and our team must have given you a wildly inaccurate estimate.  I'm so sorry for the very long wait.  We'll get better and hope you'll give us another chance.  What can I do to make it up to you and leave you with a better experience?""  

This, however, was not a good manager.  Instead of an apology or any sense of understanding, the Locale manager shrugged and told me.  ""It's Friday night.  I don't know what else to tell you.""  Hmmmm.  This is the best response he could offer?  This is what I get for ordering from them on a Friday night, like it's to be expected to have a restaurant screw up and make me wait while I'm trying to support a new local restaurant?  

I won't be going back anytime soon.  I'll wait it out for a long while and hope they get better staff and better customer service.  Oh, and two of the three dishes we ordered were cold in the 4 minutes it took us to get home.",2021-01-17 01:55:38,648,2888,

Anyway... upon meeting his new friends, he went fucking wild! He was chasing them vigorously. They found they could nearly hide between the heater and the glass or between the filter tubes and the glass, but Waldo was ruthless.

He ate one of the tetras within 3 minutes. It was like the shark scene in the little mermaid. On the drive home from PetSmart, I was okay w the potential of these three, rather inexpensive, fish dying instantly, but by the time they were in the tank escaping the bloodbath, I felt very responsible for their lives.

I promptly removed the (now well fed) turtle from the tank and had my wife babysit him while I fished the remaining fish out of the tank.

To my wife, ""watching"" Waldo meant getting herself, Waldo, and our dog into a selfie. Somehow this led to Bella (the dog) getting bit!

I got the fish out. Got them safely in a Tupperware, got Waldo back in his tank, and took off to PetSmart, hoping they'd be put back in the safety of professionals. Surprisingly, PetSmart refunded all the fish (even the dead on!!). Yay customer service.

When I got home, he'd eaten all of his plants! Fucking asshole turtle.

Anyway, I'm now slightly proud, slightly scared, very intrigued by my game of thrones level turtle.

On an unrelated note. Two trips to PetSmart in one day has sparked an interest in parakeets! They're super cute, very charismatic! Anyone here fuck with birds at all? Anyone here have a killer turtle story?",2021-01-22 21:00:54,495,2293,

I had heard wonderful reviews from friends about the Woodhouse Day Spa so I was excited to experience it first hand. The changing room at this location is a little small, with only one toilet. A lot of customers used the toilet as a changing room as well so it was a little annoying how long you needed to wait at times to be able to use it. I also noticed there was one shower which would have been nice to use after treatments but did not notice any towels and the attendant when showing me how to use the lockers didn't mention the shower. Maybe they are hoping guests won't currently use it due to COVID. After changing into the warm robe there are two relaxation rooms you can wait in before and between treatments. They offer water or hot cinnamon tea which is a nice touch. They do have signs asking people to leave their cell phones out of this room for relaxation so I was a bit annoyed when another guest had her phone in the room texting with people and the sound was turned on. This of course is no fault to the spa, some people just can't seem to break away from their phones. 

The spa was offering some holiday promotions so I booked one of their packages that included a hot stone massage, a facial and pedicure to end the day. Loved all three treatments. I had to keep my mask on during the massage which was a bit uncomfortable when laying face down on the table. During the facial you are able to have your mask off the entire time which makes sense as they are working on your face, but I wish I could have taken it off when laying face down for my massage. Normally I wouldn't have picked a pedicure at a salon like this, but as it was a part of the package it was a nice treatment. 

The service was great and I'll be back as I have a few more gift cards. I also purchase the $100 in cards to receive a $20 bonus, but was informed while there that each bonus card can only be used once per person per day. While I would have liked to have known this when purchasing the cards, I am looking forward to booking at least 5 more treatments to use all of my bonus cards.",2021-01-04 17:11:14,453,2157,

My boyfriend wanted a nice steak dinner for his birthday and I let him choose the spot this time. When we pulled up to a Motel, to say that I was a bit floored was an understatement but I kept my mouth shut because it was his birthday pick. Up until we got through the front door, I wasn't convinced. However, as soon as we stepped through the door, I was thrilled. 

You walk in and it's like you've gone back in time to sounds of Frank Sinatra, a tasteful mirrored wall and a bartender in a vest. It was a welcome surprise for sure. The hostess was not present when we first walked in but the bartender was willing to seat us and was extremely pleasant. We were seated in a back corner that was intimate and perfect. 

On to the food! The warm bread and rosemary, garlic butter was literally out of this world. We ordered calamari to start and I wish we went with the mussels. The breading on the calamari was bland but they were warm, as was the marinara. I ordered the crab scampi and the portion size was a bit small (perhaps it was so good I just wanted more) but the quantity and quality of crab was the best that I've ever had. It was not shredded up and hidden in the sauce. They were true jumbo chunks that were delicious. 

My bf had the surf and turf with the garlic topping and the bacon jam on the side. The steak was perfectly medium rare, seared to perfection. The bacon jam was the most unique thing I've ever tasted. It was like breakfast on steak. Not my jazz at all but A+ for creativity. My boyfriend loved it. The lobster was slightly disappointing in comparison. The lobster was huge which was a plus and wonderfully cooked, tender and not dry but it was very bland. It was almost like the water it was boiled in sucked out the flavor - perhaps just a bit a salt in the water could have helped. Lastly, the bananas foster was a delight. It was made table side with a massive flame and it was perfect. 

The service we received was terrific. Our waiter was warm and attentive and the owner (I presume) greeted us, which was so pleasant and rarely happens these days. Everyone who was working or not seated had a mask. The vibe at this restaurant is one that is sorely missed. I love the authenticity. It was nice to have dinner at a nice spot that isn't a chain. I do have to note that one set patrons loudly expressed their opinions about the recent elections. As off putting the comments were, the owner who was conversing with them, reacted in a neutral way that I respected and really was a deciding factor on if I would return. Kudos to my boyfriend for finding this hidden gem!",2021-01-22 17:23:41,572,2680,

I'll start with the positives: it's BYOB (but make sure you bring enough wine -- it might make the rest of the experience tolerable). The oysters were excellent. Unfortunately, that's about the extent of the positives at this place. 

A group of 5 of us went and each of us left unhappy. It was a Wednesday night with only a handful of other tables in the entire restaurant. One would think with it being a slow night that things would go smoothly, right? 

We were greeted by the host and while midway walking us to our table decided to leave and help another customer. We were left standing awkward in the middle of the dining room. Normally I wouldn't care, but the guy didn't even come back. We had to ask someone else to figure out where the table was. 

We got to our table and a few moments later the waiter approaches --- it was the host! I guess he was assuming both roles for the night. He told us briefly about the menu and the several items they were out of (their menu is small to begin with, but being a pandemic I can understand). We placed our order and then continued on with the evening. 

Now onto the entrees. The first thing the waiter came out with was the branzino which he began fileting table side. About a minute later another waiter came out with  our pasta dishes. Someone in my party ordered scallops, but she was brought pasta . The waiter acknowledged it was his mistake and that he ""couldn't read his writing. ""  Her pasta was taken away and only three of the five of us had our entrees in front of us. Being polite, we were waiting to eat until everyone had their food. The waiter continued trying to filet the branzino table side for what felt like an eternity. I don't know if it was his first day, but this was unbelievable. It probably took at least ten minutes for him to finish. By that point the entrees on the table were cold and there was still no scallops to be seen. Four of the five of us decided to go ahead and eat. The food was subpar at best. We all finished our food before the other person in the party even got her scallops. They eventually came and those too were disappointing. 

The portions sizes were very small and since we were all still hungry we decided to press our luck with dessert. We all had our eyes on burnt marshmallow budino. But guess what? They don't have it anymore! They replaced it with a banana pudding thing that did not sound appetizing at all. We picked something else and the desserts came out. The waiter decided to bring us the banana dessert to try it out.  It was dreadful. 

It was one of the worst meals I have had in a very long time. I'm just glad I was wasted for most of it.",2021-01-29 01:26:14,574,2704,

I was able to get a reservation the same day, but when I arrived the lobby was slammed and crowded with a party of 11 waiting to be seated, so when I was told it would be a 5-10 minute wait, I did so outside. They offered us to eat at the bar or patio but it was crowded. There is a clearly marked sign informing customers masked are required. After 25 minutes we were seated. As we walked to the tepan table it was crowded inside. The sushi bar was closed. As I was seated my party of two shared a table with a family of three, across from us were full tables on either side; the customers were not 6 feet away and most customers removed their masks once seated. I can't say if there was social distancing in the bar, but the outside space had a few people ( it was a cold January at 7pm) without signs to ensure distancing. My dinner experience was super, as always. My sushi was very good and the tepan table was a delight. However, it was a crowded dining experience for me.  I can't help but think for the staff it's business as usual. My night was filled with loud entertainment, just how I remembered from past evenings before 2020. With three empty seats between me and the other family at our table, there was no change between tepan tables, all were up and running filled with customers.  
   The lack of social distancing I was very aware of. No hand sanitizer that I noticed and the initial check in was clumsy, with no assurance from the hostess we weren't forgotten. I wore my mask except to eat then put it back on. I perhaps I should have held off going till when Arizona's Corona Virus cases went down.  I was uncomfortable.",2021-01-16 13:05:50,367,1727,

Here's a short version..started my pool dig in June...now it's February basically and still have not had anyone come out to fix issues we've told them about since August. Pool finish has discoloration, my pavers are uneven, cracked and not flush, took them 3 months to fix our fence and no actual representative from Olympus has actually been to my residence since July or August just contractors that leave oil stains in my street. I've contacted who I believe is the owner ""James"" who in short just said we are finding things to complain about. Honestly he seemed like he could give 2 shits. WTF?  I spent $72k on the pool, $13k for pavers that look like my 15 year old did them. All we asked was for someone to come and see in person but they want us to send them pictures. I've tried taking pics showing the pavers  it not sure how to show that the pavers are not level etc. 

In short this company does not care about the customer they will take your money then hound you to keep paying them even before the work is done. We financed through Lyon financial and even they tried for months to get issues resolved and couldn't get ahold of anyone from Olympus. 

Again I can go in forever. All I can say is if you decide to use these unprofessional imbeciles then you deserve the crap your going to deal with. Don't just read my review but look up the company and the multiple negative reviews from numerous people. I only picked them because a neighbor had used them and didn't have any issues. Not sure what happened from the time they did my neighbors pool to mine but DONT USE OLYMPUS!!!

There have been a lot of people also filing with the BBB which is my next step. At this point I have months of emails text messages etc showing their negligence and the dozens of times they said they would be at my house to fix issues and never showed up. Keeping in mind the money I lost by taking unpaid days off work. Luckily I have a home security system that I can show and disprove any date they try to lie and say they went to my house.

Very cute and thought out decor that makes you feel like you're in a vacation Greek spot rather than Tampa. Very diverse menu even though they specialize in baked goods and breads. Make a reservation for the weekend! Our server was very friendly and there was a very diverse crowd with the restaurants between customers and servers very LGBT friendly which was nice to see. The back of the restaurant patio is a nice space for event and just sitting. Their lattes are good sourced from bandit coffee and standard coffee art. The baklava simple was unique as well as the two different kinds of cookies served with each of the latte's. The normal latte came with an apple sesame cookie that was weird at first bite but then was pleasantly delicious. The baklava latte came with a twisted looking cinnamon shortbread cookie that was very good as well. They do a great job with their presentation and baked goods here. The tables are set with glassware and silverware on small plates with a paper place setting when you are seated with a napkin that says their name on it. The lox bagel sandwich is pretty epic! Not the easiest to eat but full of flavor and beautifully presented. The eggs Benedict is served with their biscuit which is more like a bread but absolutely delicious and different than anything I've had before as well as their ""homemade"" bacon which is very thick sliced pork a little bit on the fattier side and topped with a white sauce rather than a Hollandaise sauce. It was a very unique and delicious take on the classic eggs benedict also perfectly paired with a side mixed greens salad perfectly tossed in some sort of light vinaigrette.

After hearing the hype about Sprinkles cupcakes for years I couldn't wait to try one for myself! 

There was a large menu by the counter where you place your order describing each flavor (see photos), and it was one of the rare occasions where most of the items on the menu sounded good to me! I tried the dark chocolate and my daughter tried the red velvet (and gave her approval). The dark chocolate was good - it was moist and flavorful, but nothing out of this world that would make me drive all the way to Tampa for a cupcake. Maybe my expectations were set too high from all the hype. Would I eat a cupcake from Sprinkles again? Of course! I just didn't think it was a knock-your-socks-off, out of this world, amazing cupcake, that is worth a special trip to Hyde Park Village.  

The cupcakes were $3.99 which seemed reasonable. They offer some really unique flavors (some special cupcakes cost extra) and given their location and the quality of the cupcake, it was worth it. 

The restaurant had signs indicating customers needed to wear masks and that social distancing was enforced, which is reassuring. Overall the store was very clean, something that is always important to me when it comes to dining out. 

The coolest part of the store was actually outside - they had a Cupcake ATM! Yes, that's right, a CUPCAKE ATM! Craving a special Sprinkles cupcake at 2 am? You're in luck!

Upon arrival, there is no designated parking or garage, so you have to park in front of the building and have the car valeted. This seemed to be no problem, but upon arrival to the front desk we were greeted by several people including 2 managers, all who informed us that we would have to wait for the front desk receptionist to come back for assistance as they could not help us with the hotel side. (This location seems more concerned with their restaurant than their hotel). We waited for a while at the desk because apparently the front desk is the only person who can check you in, valet your car etc. after the receptionist finally arrived, she informed we could not check in 10 mins early and asked that we wait at the bar for the room to be ready. No problem, we grabbed a drink and waited while she went to park our vehicle. The valet service here is weird, because they don't allow you to know where they've parked your vehicle, so if you need anything from your vehicle they have to retrieve it for you (which is super inconvenient). We finally got checked into our room around 3:00. Upon arrival to the room, we thought the room to be nice. The only issue with the room is it's described as having a ""courtyard view."" The courtyard was just some AstroTurf and some old Christmas tree decorations they had yet to take down. No way to access said courtyard and the windows of the room were paper thin so you could hear all the activity on the street below which is busy with restaurants, bars, and shops. The bath tub and shower were nice, but there is literally no vent in the bathroom so all the condensation just piles up on the ceiling and looks wet the entire time (which I'm sure doesn't help with keeping mold away). We settled in for the night none the less. We decided a little later into the evening to order room service. Upon calling down to place the order the person who picked up advised we had to wait for the front desk person (again) to place our order so we waited for a call back. When we finally got a call back, I had questions about the menu. Any time I asked a question, instead of placing us on hold, the receptionist hung up to go ask (3x this happened mind you) and then called us back to inform. Finally got the order in and it was delivered to our room with not too much of a wait. The food was okay, the salad just tastes of weird pepper instead of vinaigrette. It was also strange that during a pandemic the woman insisted on coming into our room to provide the food/cart (mind you we were in bath robes and uncomfortable). Overall, the stay was sub par at best, and I expected better seeing as though the hotel is so small, that they cater to fewer guests, so I was under the impression the service would be more attentive than it was. We will more than likely not be returning to this property. The hotel has great potential, if only they valued the hotel more than their restaurant.",2021-01-15 18:12:00,652,3095,

I got there at 3 on a drizzly afternoon. There were already a couple of people waiting for their order. Besides the birria tacos, they have guacamole and chips. Very friendly and welcoming. My order was ready probably in 10 minutes. Much faster than the other popular birria tacos food truck several blocks away.

The tacos have two layers of crispy tortilla with caramelized melted cheese adding umami to the tacos. It automatically comes with cheese so if you don't want cheese I recommend that you tell them when you place the order. The cheese are evenly distributed and melts on  tortilla perfectly, not too much to create a glob of cheese. The tacos are filled with good amount of tender beef with finely chopped onions. The tortilla is completely soaking the flavor of the consommé already drizzled on it during the cooking process. The moment of truth: the consommé flavor. It's amazing, balanced flavor with a subtle heat, very refreshing, and don't forget to squirt the lime. I keep on dunking the tacos in it. If you like more heat to your tacos, they have it covered by providing creamy chipotle sauce in the bag. There's also some shredded beef in the consommé. Not too greasy, I don't want to waste any of it. Maybe make a ramen with the leftover consommé. I saw an Instagram post of ramen with birria consommé.

Guacamole is fresh with enough heat from the chopped jalapeño with chopped tomato and red onion. It comes in a paper coffee cup with a lid.

What I like about this truck is the consommé and the guacamole are not in a styrofoam cup. The tacos and the chips are in styrofoam container. I hope they can change it to more environmentally friendly container.",2021-01-03 22:13:46,377,1874,

First impressions- great location for IUPUI and the hospitals right by there. I love this area, and the outside seating will be wonderful when warmer. I picked up three different bowls- the short rib philly, chicken parmesan and buffalo blue. Absolutely loved the short rib bowl! It was interesting with the short rib but in a delicious way. I added jalapenos and extra mushrooms which really added a kick.  The buffalo blue was ""ok"" per my husband. He added more hot sauce, which I'm sure they could add if requested. The chicken parmesan... neither my son or husband cared for. I was told it didn't taste good and it never was eaten. Honestly not sure how it could be that bad, so I will chalk it up to it maybe not being made correctly. Once again, it was just opening so there was learning on the job. My biggest complaint was one of the people being trained was working the cash register or walking around with her mask not covering her nose. I know it's not a big thing, but when somebody is handling food or cash, and a mask is mandated it should be worn properly. I did say something to the manager, but during the time I was there it was never corrected and the same employee left the mask where it was. Right now during this health crisis, everybody needs to pitch in and do things correctly. Especially employees at a restaurant who are handling food for customers.

I would definitely return here, maybe in the spring when I can sit outside and enjoy the weather. It's worth giving it another try when everyone is trained and things are running smoothly. For now, I would say it was an average experience. It was a little expensive for a very average bowl of pasta.",2021-01-23 22:22:36,360,1747,

And why would want to eat at  that place when you can get it from your neighborhood (made with love )Chinese restaurant. They have no problems making it spicy or adjusting anything else on the menu. You can definitely taste the love in every dish that is made here. I would name many more of the dishes but it's hard to pick a favorite when I love everything on the menu. The great thing about this place is that they also have a traditional Chinese menu as well for those who want to eat more Authentic. You would be doing injustice to your stomach if you didn't try this place out. Like I mention I am a chef and been cooking for over 30 years and this is my go to place for Chinese food. Stop in sample the food made with love and introduce yourself to Jung. Tell her Chef Rich sent you . I promise you won't be disappointed.",2021-01-30 00:25:33,310,1469,

You can find one at East Side. Trust me on this. 

The storefront is well located on East Main St. There are a few parking spots out front (shared with a well known sushi spot next door), and more side street parking available. 

Their COVID precautions are solid. 100% masked staff (yes, over the nose AND the mouth).

The menu is posted prominently, I went with the roast pork Banh Mi, added a ""crispy pork stick"", and a cup of Vietnamese iced coffee.

The coffee was tasty, and not cloyingly sweet like it can be; OTOH, the cup had more than a few too many grounds in the drink. I'm not sure that I'd order it again; it was pretty gritty. 

The pork stick was a hot crispy treat; ground pork and spices wrapped in a light fried wrapper. Like the best egg roll ever, without the useless cabbage filler :-)

The banh mi was larger than others I've had around town. True, it was more expensive, but for the size (and the quality of the ingredients) it was very reasonably priced. 

The bread was great; I have always disliked the dry, cotton like crumb of most banh mi baguettes. This one had a properly crispy crust, but the bread had more tooth (and flavor; might have been whole wheat or even sourdough?).

The ingredients were fresh and very high quality. The pork shoulder was tender, flavorful, and plentiful.  I got it without jalapeños; next time I might chance them (I've found that the ratio of burning hot jalapeño ribs and seeds to filling can vary widely!). 

All in, with tip, I spent about $20. Totally worth it. I tore into the food so fast that I forgot to take pics; that's how much I liked it. I will definitely be back.

Very highly recommended for delicious Banh Mi sammies in East Nasty!",2021-01-26 01:23:24,413,1846,

I take back everything I said in my previous review. The company as a whole has a horrible policy when it comes to canceling a deceased member's account. I was ready to pay my mother's final bill when I showed up that day with the death certificate to cancel it. They said I didn't have to pay it at all. Well, guess what? I received another bill but this time they added a late fee. I tried calling the toll free customer service line. I explained what happened and they said there's nothing they can do about it per PHI. I would have to go back to the store that canceled it. I called this local store and the manager said to ignore the bill. What???? They said that eventually the system would see the reason why it was canceled due to death. Are you kidding me?

Long story short, I ended up paying the bill online with my credit card (including the fee). This wouldn't have happened had they let me pay at the store the first time I presented the death certificate. Thanks for nothing! I will never get an AT&T account because of this. This should have been an easy process, but instead they made it worse on the family member reporting the death. Change your policy so that this doesn't happen again to anyone else. Do not bill if you see that an account was closed due to death (if this is truly a rule) or simply don't tell the customer that payment is not needed. This happened in October 2020 and I'm still upset about it.

**** Previous review below:

Great customer service! I had to cancel my deceased mother's account. I'd been told over the phone by customer service that this could be done at any AT&T location, but that was not true. I went to their Valrico location where she opened her account, but was told that they are retail and not corporate. He told me to go to the corporate location which happens to be this store in Brandon. It's the one on Brandon Blvd in the Outback Steakhouse strip mall.

I walked in and was immediately greeted. She was super friendly and I wish I could remember her name. They had many people waiting for service. All the consultation tables were spaced out by 6 feet or more, and were already occupied. Everyone was wearing a mask.

I didn't have to wait too long. In fact, they came over with sincerest sympathy and took care of me right away. I showed them the death certificate. They have to physically see it in person before closing the account. The transaction was done within a matter of minutes. I didn't even need to pay the last bill.

They made it as painless as possible. I was totally impressed. I would go back to this store in the future if I ever find myself needing a new mobile provider. Thanks again for being so friendly and compassionate.",2021-01-16 13:45:05,585,2723,

 I arrive at the low store in Plymouth Meeting at approximately 6:45 a.m. I had the call button in appliances finally around 7 o'clock I go to the customer service people. Where I am asked to meet someone in the hardware all. So I do that this employ was very pleasant although I knew or employee and did not know how to handle the situation together we go back to the customer service desk. This is when they discover that I cannot make this purchase in store I'm the return because I need to bring the hot water heater with me. 

 I explained that I simply can't get i 50 gallon water heater in my car and even if I could that I don't Know the 1st thing of how to uninstall a gas water heater safely. I am told that I can bring in the plaque unfortunately I can't do that either because it's a sticker that seems to tear when being removed explain this to them.  I'm told they cannot help me that I have to call a phone number when I get home to set up for Install and purchase. I call the number when I get home. This is apparently a phone number for installation of flooring make a not help me.I do some additional search on my end at home and find out there's another number I can call so I call that one. 

 This time I am told I need to purchase the hot water heater a front and the install and that the installer will know what to do with the hot water heater that is being returned by this point I am skeptical. They send me the documents and I refused to sign it because nowhere on there does it say that the water heater needs to be returned to the store the are main number is also not on the dockusign I call back And I speak to the people again and I tell them that I know for a fact that if I sign this document that this water heater is going to go missing and that I'm not gonna get my refund so I insist 5 times that I need the are a number on the Documents. I further request the day please put on there that the instructions are that the water heater needs to go back to the lowes store in Plymouth meeting. The 2nd time I get the document line it still says that the installer can dispose off the hot water heater. However we have made progress that the RMA number is on the documents . So I signed the documents because I need hot water in my house.


12/28/20 

The next morning we get a call my husband goes round and round with the installer they come out the install the hot water heater when they're leaving my husband tells him the RMA and that he needs to take it back to the Plymouth Meeting store at which the installer says I don't know anything about that I can dispose of it for you luckily my husband is smart he does not let the installer take the water heater the installer said I can take it back to the store but you have to come with me. My husband was working and unable to leave so he kept the hot water heater and it stayed in our driveway overnight. When I get home I called the store saying what the heck is happening I was promised that the installer would know what to do with the water heater which is precisely why I wanted that on the documents I am told we will pick it up tomorrow.

 At this point I have no faith in anyone in this company to get this water heater back under the army number so I paint with nail Polish on the hot water heater the army number so that even if You are not especially dependable there should be no Room for error.


12/29/20

 The hot water heater is picked up success. I call that evening to ensure that it was returned to the store I wonder why I doubt that it was? I am told they will not receive it until the 30th


12/30/20

 I call back to ensure that it was returned I am told it was sure enough. Hallelujah I am told I should get my refund within approximately 24 hours.


12/31/20

 I call back because they do not see a refund I am told oh know, unless you paid cash you won't see that money for 15 days .  so I think OK I have to be a little patient But, I also request an itemized receipt.  I am told that a customer service person can print a receipt but has no way of getting it to me unless I drive a 1/2 hour for it which I can't do I said can you email it sure I can E mail that tomorrow Morning.great! 


Throughout all of thisThe person who was of the most help with Matt at the Plymouth Meeting store.

I have been in customer service for over 20 years made never given such poor customer service to anyone. I wonder why it costs almost double to have a hot   What are heater installed as it does to by the said water heater,  And yet for double that money the installer doesn't know how return works.

When it comes in comparison with other places, however, there are some room for improvement.  Actually, I am sad this didn't quite hit the spot for us! It was decent, but nothing that wowed me. To me, it appears to have some similar dishes you would find in Chinese restaurants and a some Vietnamese dishes too.

In the past, we have tried the Beef and Broccoli and Chicken with Black Bean Sauce (if I remember right). We also have had the pan-fried crispy noodles, which were unique! Very crispy! Since having Vietnamese food more and traveling, for this visit, we wanted to get some different menu items. We ordered the Chicken Rice Hot Pot (Com Tay Cam Ga), Rice Flour Crepes with Char-Broiled Pork (Bahn Cuon Thit Nuong), and Chicken With Soft Noodles (Mia Xao Don Ga). 

This trip was  also take out during the pandemic. I will say the Rice Hot Pot with Chicken was great! They plated it perfectly where the bottom stayed crispy. The flavor of the chicken and veggies themselves were a bit bland, but overall hot, crispy, and good. The soft noodles were not too bad and probably my favorite of the three dishes but still lacking a little bit of flavor.  The Pork in the Flour Crepe was delicious! It was marinated with excellent flavor and was another great part of our meal.

I haven't been go karting in awhile, so I decided to try it out. My boyfriend and I went for a date night on a Saturday around 9:30, and it wasn't too busy thankfully. For covid, everyone is wearing masks and sanitize consistently, and there are only about 8 people allowed per race. It was about $50 for 2 people ($20 per race, $6 annual membership per person). The head socks are all new and you get to keep them. The course was a little smaller than I expected, but you get 14 laps and I'd say that's a good deal. I was satisfied at the end of the race and felt safe. There was no gas smell, but my helmet visor did fall off in the middle of the race though lol. 

The only thing I'd recommend is that the people at the front desk be a little more welcoming. We were standing there for almost a minute and all 3 people there glanced at us, but not one hello or smile. It didn't ruin our experience, just felt a little hostile. The people running the course seemed more friendly though. At the end, you go to the front desk to get your race results. Also, definitely check in at least 30 minutes prior. We were signed up for the 9:30pm and got there at 9pm, and they started us at 9:20pm, so don't miss your slot! Also also, wear contacts if you can! I didn't bring any and had to force my glasses into my helmet. 

Mini golf course and VR looked interesting. I don't know if I'd recommend the VR during Covid because I didn't see anyone use or sanitize it, but I wouldn't know. The black light mini golf course was small, but for $6 a person, I'm sure you can have fun with friends or a date.",2021-01-12 05:28:02,383,1663,

My server was Alex and she was training another server (can't remember her name but sweet girl) and the service wasn't horrible but I do have to mention my loss for stars. First, we had a reservation and were sat outside on the patio, no biggie I'm easy to please but the fans were on so we asked for them to turn the one over our head off which would've made our visit a bit more relaxing but the fan remained turned on the entire time (burrrrr). Secondly, my food was delicious but my date didn't really enjoy his meal as much and he isn't really one to complain so he wasn't going to say anything but when we did end up wanting to make a switch I would've expected the server to make some sort of recommendations but she simply handed him a menu to look for something else so he just ended up getting some wings to take home... As a trainer, I felt she should've been a lot more assertive if not for us definitely for her trainee. And my only other complaint was that our table was hardly pre-bussed which I know from working in the service industry is a big deal. I'm not here to get anyone in trouble but this is more of a constructive criticism review as I feel it's necessary to critique the trainers performance as much as they do the trainees.

To be honest, the first time I came here I was rather disappointed, but subsequent visits made me fell in love with this place! Located on Callowhill and a rather easy place to get to with ample parking around, it's easy to drive or walk there. They have an indoor area and most recently a larger outdoor area (given COVID), though I would say still rather limited compared to bigger restaurants. They serve personal sized circular pan pizzas (pretty big for 1 person) or large (very large, don't take it for granted; 1 can feed 3-4 people decently) pan pizzas. Again, one of the best tasting pizzas in the city; they make their own dough and cook it in a brick oven. I highly recommend short rib (seasonal! so get it while it lasts), spinach, and fennel sausage pizzas; they are delicious! In terms of appetizers, the Rotolo is pretty popular; however, it is small and good as a personal appetizer, but not really a group appetizer. They do serve drinks as well, with many signature cocktails and wine choices. They also have a good selection of beer. Price for everything is moderate, and I would expect to spend ~$20 (not including drinks) here. Service is also exceptional, with very well-versed servers. Highly recommend!

It's solid westernized Thai food (chocolate sauce on mango coconut rice, why) and there are definitely better Thai offerings in the area.  Case in point is the Pad Siew, it should be so good, yet very average the last few times we had it.  Same with the Pad Thai, very meh and uninspired, really missing the layers of flavour, the citrus and chilies. Mostly I taste tomato paste and sugar. 
More than a few times I've had clumpy undercooked noodles. 

There is also a limited selection of meats (mainly chicken, beef or tofu) and dishes relative to other local Thai places like Boualouang. What I wouldn't give for some duck, or more fish options. A person avoiding pork, however, would appreciate this menu.  One dish that is consistently excellent is Lahp Sinn, I could eat that all day. The Tohm Yum Gai had a ton of chicken in it, very generous, but it's not as spicy and sour as I would like, or even as I would make myself.

Customer service is lacking at times. The last time we ordered pickup during Chinatown Dining Week, the staff was very short on the phone, and I had to interrupt twice so I could continue my order without being hung up on.  They also don't tend to ask about spice level, and honestly the choice is appreciated. When I've gone to the restaurant to pick up, however, everything is ready and perfectly packaged, and the service has been polite.

BEWARE if you order online, you'll end up having to pick up from their Calgary Trail location. Best to call the downtown location directly if you plan to pick up.

Average Thai food, all the way. Good luck to them in their Calgary Trail location. I hope they will maintain their downtown location and not let the quality slip.",2021-01-23 04:23:54,394,1866,

But.

They said it would take two hours.  It took three hours.

After they told me it would take three hours, I came back almost exactly two hours later, and saw my car parked right where I had left it.  They had not even started.  I asked the guy about it.  He said it would be 20 minutes.  I sat outside to wait.  A few minutes later one of the guys pulled my car into the repair bay.  Great.  20 minutes later he pulls it out.  I asked if it was done.  He said they still needed to check the alignment.  I sat and waited as my car remained parked there for about 20 more minutes.  Finally they pulled it in to another bay, and after another 10 minutes they came to get my authorization to fix the alignment, and then it was done in about another 15 minutes.

The name of the place is ""Big Brand TIRE and Service"".  Their main job is putting on tires and checking alignment, all day, every day.  I don't understand how when someone comes in and asks you to do the main, normal, exact thing you do dozens of times a day, with no custom requirements, you can be so wrong about how long it's going to take.  Note that I don't really care how long it takes.  If it takes three hours that's fine.  But what is going through the person's mind when they say ""it will be ready at 4:20, or 4:30 at the latest"" and it isn't ready until 5:30?  How can they not know how long it's going to take when they do it over and over again every single day?  How can they not know that they need to add a cushion on top of their time estimate so they won't be an hour off?

Anyway that's my little ranty review.  If you don't care about accurate time estimates, come here and you'll probably be satisfied.  My feedback to the business owners is to KEEP TRACK of how long it ACTUALLY TAKES for you to do your tasks and use that information to give accurate estimates to your customers.  I will be trying other places in the future.  If they're just as bad I may come back here but this is kind of a pet peeve for me.",2021-01-07 03:30:42,463,2076,

It was suppose to be replaced and when the replacement came it was damaged and was told I had to call to arrange yet another replacement. In the mean time I went into the store and the manager was rude and asked me to leave cause I was upset and didn't get any help.

Was given a time 12-5 but got a call at 8:15am that they were on their way because they were told 8-5 was my window. Yup another issues. New refrigerator makes a humming sound and the freezer door sticks. Called again and talked to about 4 reps to get a repair person. A week later they come but it's a delivery truck not the repair people so again they apologize and tell me someone will call me to arrange the repair.  Well they didn't call I had to call AGAIN!!! I'm losing count on how many times I call and the reps I talked to because it's way to many. Finally got a person with a brain and set appointment(January now)  with Geek Squad to come and again 8-5p. I waited all day and at 6:30p I called and again it took several times calling and this time I was getting hung up on. I had to ask why no one showed up for my appt that was confirmed the prior day. I was told the appt was cancelled but they don't know why and couldn't tell me who cancelled. So guess what I wasted an entire day waiting for NOTHING!!! 
I've given up trying to get help and now I have to live with a shitty refrigerator (Insignia) since they don't care.  I would never ever ever buy anything from Beat Buy again! Their customer service absolutely sucks

Well we'll this is easily becoming one of my favorite spots to eat at . Let's start with the beef short rib this was my least favorite thing I had today but still solid . The meat was pretty tender although I expected more fat for a short rib and it had a slightly sweet sauce 7/10 
Eel Skewer freaking delish like the beef skewer it had a slightly sweet sauce and was charred just right on the top , so you get some crispy texture followed by the buttery mouthfeel eel gives 10/10. 
Pork belly skewer - pretty damn good , the pork belly was cooked well but like the short rib I was expecting just a bit more fat to shine through . I did have the thin sliced pork belly over the rice before and it was more tender than this one but maybe the thick cut and longer cooking time of the skewer had something to do with that 8/10. 
The shishito dumplings were great , these came with a sweet chili sauce that I could not get enough of 9/10. Last but not least we have the brusse sprouts . Personally I like when it's cooked just a tad more so the insides are almost flaky but the outside had that , they were lightly salted with a slightly sweet sauce 7/10. Service impeccable I mean the waiters make you feel good answered my many questions because quite frankly I'm a curious guy . The restaurant has a relatively small dining area but the decor and feel is very Japanese like .

We arrived a few minutes early for our 7pm-9pm time block. We walked up the steps to the hostess stand and our waitress was standing with a sign that read ""John's Bachelor Party"". She greeted us and took us to our bays.

We got settled in and she showed us around the area we had for our party. She then started on food and drink orders for us. A floor manager was then also around to greet us, help us get ourselves set up to golf and made small talk. They took an interest in the fact I was getting married, congratulated me and were downright friendly and welcoming.

Once we all got signed in on the computer, we started golfing. The concept is really cool and the technology was pretty impressive. As you hit the ball, it's tracked all the way out, it interacts with the system and gives you immediate stats. Distance, speed and other things. In addition, there are different games you can play that interact with the ball. We played an ""Angry Birds"" game that was actually pretty fun. You hit the golf ball and it translates to throwing the bird to knock down the structures. Since we were 6 people in 2 bays, we all got plenty of playing time. The two-hour window was more than enough time.

The food and drink was excellent as well. We had $175 food and drink credit with our reservation. We ordered some pitchers of beer, appetizers and a few other food items. The pretzel bites were hot and fresh, came with two dipping sauces and were lightly salted. Really liked those. The mac and cheese bites were also excellent. A little kick to them. Slightly crunchy on the outside and hot and cheesy on the inside. We also had chicken nachos and a steak flatbread. All the food was really good and we easily hit our $175.

Our waitress was around quite often to check us. She was super friendly and made sure our evening was perfect.

No more than 5 feet from trailer door. Absolutely NO employees were working the front desk or phone despite an earlier call detailing when we'd be in that morning to settle our bill.  This Inbred had absolutely zero customer service skills, he started our conversation with hostility and just continually escalated what could have been a quick fix situation. Instead he began cursing and demanding my removal from the property. My mother was called a ""bitch"" multiple times by this cowardly man, I was threatened and almost assaulted. 

I've been in contact with Triple A, who this ""business"" mainly does contract work for. A complaint has been filed, and their Company has been removed entirely as an option for Future triple A services involving my families membership. The Bordentown and Hamilton township non emergency numbers were contacted about this incident and complaints have been filed.  The Better business burrow has also been contacted and a online complaint has been received by them as well.  I suggest whoever else who has been victimized by this establishment follows suit. & whoever has been lucky enough to avoid this business, unless your into potential junkyard brawls I suggest finding another company. 

This is not a business. This is not how a successful business is ran. Your employees are ruining your company's reputation and your families name is being directly dragged through the mud. You proudly employee workers who verbally abuse women. Never again!",2021-01-29 19:29:53,407,2153,

I've eaten at several locations and the taste has been consistently good when it comes to the food. I prefer cooked sushi, so this is my go-to place whenever I'm craving it. I was excited when I found out that Nashville now had a location, and I've eaten inside and ordered from this location 4 times now.

Each time I go inside, I'm always a bit disappointed with the service. After my first time dining alone at the bar here, I decided I would just order my sushi to-go because the staff is not very friendly. I'd rather eat at home than be around people who aren't nice or barely acknowledges me. I only go back because I like the food.

This past weekend, I placed a pickup order and once I went inside I saw a crowd of people waiting at the door. There was no hostess so one of the guys standing there told me how he had been waiting for his pickup order for over 30 minutes. I waited for almost 10 minutes at the door before the hostess even acknowledged me, and when she did she was very nonchalant and didn't apologize for the wait.

I finally got my food and left, and luckily the food was good..minus the fact that one of the orders I asked for no jalapeños and of course there were jalapeños on top. I ordered the Thriller roll and the Heart roll, which are my two favorites. My boyfriend, who isn't a sushi fan, thoroughly enjoyed the heart roll and was shocked that he was full off of the meal.

Either way, this location has consistently disappointed me on the service, but the sushi is good.",2021-01-25 03:30:41,340,1586,

Even Pre Covid this place is really busy especially on Friday nights.  Now at 1/2 capacity makes it even more challenging so glad we booked this 3 weeks in advance. Before anything else I have to mention that what made this place special was our sever Matthew B he was so awesome and we were all so impressed...we did have a delay on our reservation due to people lingering longer than they should.  

Immediately after being seated Matthew came by apologized for the inconvenience and let us know he put in a complimentary order of their fried asparagus fries which I will tell you if you come here get this or your missing out. Perfect shareable appetizer that is lightly breaded served with homemade ranch dipping sauce. We also had an order of their house made chips served with their version of frie sauce which is basically mayonnaise and ketchup but this one is a whole new level homemade from scratch with fresh tomatoes and veggies. 

For dinner you can see the pics and everything was super delicious and everyone raved how their food tasted. I personally had the Huli Huli roasted chicken. This is a 1/2 organic chicken that is house bribed then slow roasted to perfection. It is served over brown butter mashed potatoes, roasted baby carrots and Huli Huli pan sauce.  I don't what is in the Huli Huli pan sauce put it is and so delicious.  This dish is probably one of the best chicken dishes I have ever had. All the flavors were so good I polished off everything even the carrots lol...

They pinnacle of dinner was and what my son in law loves to come here for us the Forks's signature warm butter cake. It is served with Cloverleaf vanilla ice cream and fresh Oregon fruit. This dessert is so amazing I only wished I saved more room for  sharing. If you are a local Boise resident and haven't been here you are missing out on a piece of life. If you are visiting then don't miss out on this special treat and ask to sit in Matthews section you won't be disappointed.",2021-01-26 20:50:07,410,2084,

The lobby looks nice at Christmas, but that being said, people from everywhere jam the lobby taking their Christmas pictures, so it more resembles Grand Central Station at rush hour. We had a standard queen room, that frankly was so small you could hardly function in it. A queen size bed barely fit into it, in fact, one side of the bed was shoved up against the wall. In practical terms that means that there were no nightstands in the room. If you wanted to put your phone or some water next to your bed, forget it. The best you could do was put them on the floor and hang off the bed. No nightstands also means no light. There was one desk lamp for the entire room. They had one overhead light over the TV that was so dim you could only use it as a night light. There were no other lights in the room. Do you like to read in bed? No way as there is no light on one side of the room. Want to get something out of the closet? You'd better wait until morning because you can't see into the closet at night. That is the disadvantage of being in a hotel that is in a very old building. Now on to the windows. They looked original to the building and were paper thin. Every street noise imaginable was audible in that room, and we were on the 11th floor. Walls were also thin. I can't imagine what was going on above us, but sounds of moving furniture were distributing. Also, I couldn't see out of the windows because of the condensation that was on the INSIDE of the windows. That's right, the inside. I've never seen that before. The windows on the inside were dripping wet, and there were puddles of water on the sill. The bathroom was so cramped it was difficult to function. The bed and the pillows were so uncomfortable I woke up with back and neck pain every day. On top of everything the digital key wouldn't work for the elevator, apparently they had been having continuous trouble with it, so we had to wait on an endless line, (only one person working at reception), to get a regular key so we could get up to our room. As you can imagine, we were counting the days until we could leave. Do yourself a favor and skip this hotel.

When I walked in, I was impressed by the cleanliness and quietness.  There were a few other diners there for lunch but the place wasn't noisy which is important to me.  They had correct distancing  between tables.
I looked at the menu and was overwhelmed.  There are so many items on there - Thai, Vietnamese and Chinese and I saw a lot of favorites and wanted to try them all.  The prices were surprisingly low.
The waiter came over - very pleasant young man and asked if we were ready to order.  We said no, but did tell him we'd like an order a pan fried dumplings to start.  The dumplings were delicious.  They came with a nicely salted sauce and I could have made a meal out of the dumplings alone.
Friend and I both ordered a Bun bowl with shrimp and pork.  I've never had Bun before but friend recommended it so I went with it.  The bowl was good sized and contained a generous amount of vermicelli noodles, bean sprouts, thinly sliced cucumber, lettuce, sizzlingly hot shrimp and pork.  A liquid dressing was served with it, to pour over the contents in the bowl.
I've never liked cold noodles and had I realized the noodles would be served cold, I wouldn't have ordered Bun.  I am now a fan of Bun cold noodles!  I have nothing to compare this Bun bowl to because I've never had it before.  But just on it's own, it was really good.  I finished off the whole bowl as did my friend. The flavors were clean and crisp and seasoned perfectly (for me). I looked at other dishes being served to other customers and they looked really good - every person's plate/bowl/dish was completely eaten, leaving nothing on the plates.
Friend and I usually sit for a few hours and catch up on each other's lives.  the staff didn't bother us; just left us alone.

Every office can have an off day. However, after being sent there again today, LabCorp should be embarrassed and should truly get to the bottom of how bad of a facility this is. 

The first time I went I was made to feel like I was stupid and incompetent.  I have a chronic disorder that I need to get blood work checking up on a few times a year, therefore I am use to going to LabCorp. The lady working was rude, not helpful, and laughed at me the entire check in experience because my doctor did not send me with a lab slip. (We are doing virtual appointments) after the terrible check in, I was guided to a room where another patient was getting their labs done. Finally, I was given wrong information about my payment and had a hold on their services for over a month even though my insurance pay for it. 

The time today was even worse. I had the same rude lady, who again did not help or assist with trying to find my lap slip. Again ""they couldn't find it"" because my appointment was again virtual, and my doctor both times had put it in the system. She told me I didn't have a card and should just leave- when I had a copy of my insurance card faxed to the office. Then I had a man who was extremely rude when I said they were about to close and I would just try another place. ""Why do you keep bringing up we are closing? If you have something else to do say that again"" 

Both encounters there were workers everywhere not wearing their masks correctly, on their phones, and even with their feet up who didn't even blink an eye with patients being in and out.

They claim they don't do any refunds and they charge ~ $20 a session for SEVEN minutes in what they call a level 4 bed. It was so basic it would've been considered entry-level at any other salon. Garbage beds I have not seen in YEARS in other states. No ventilation or temperature control. No control over face lamps... oh, and staff doesn't wear face masks or require them for entry.

At this point I realize they either don't have my room ready or a room
Available at all. Finally they come out and the associate tells me They have another room available, not the one I Booked originally, a pool view which they could
Put me in but it would be 25$ extra up charge. I
Ofcourse was like Im not paying extra for a different room for an issue that clearly wasn't my fault. He then tells me to hold on he's going to talk to his manager again. After another wait the manager comes Out and tells me the room I booked is open but it's not cleaned so I would
Need to wait. He apologized and I was ok with this thinking it wouldn't take long to clean the room.

Late check out and it's first come first serve the morning of check out. Weird right? It's like a game) so then he goes yeah we can do that. So I had to ASK FOR THIS, it wasn't offered to
Me for the inconveniences. Then I get to my room, it's now almost 9pm.

I honestly was sorely disappointed as I was at the salon for SEVEN (7) HOURS.  Again, this wasn't a pre-scheduled 7hrs, it was the result of her being behind and doing other clients in between trying to achieve my desired cut and hair color.  In the end, the color was well short of what I wanted but I was honestly exhausted and had forsaken other matters that needed doing because my time was monopolized by her during this time.  The cut was also misshapen and uneven which I realized once I combed through my hair after leaving.  I was HOT to say the least.  To add insult to injury, she asked me if I wanted to leave a tip which was jarring especially after having been there for 7hrs.  I called her to express my dismay and she advised that she would call me back.  A week passed, she didn't make contact, and I renewed my interest in speaking with her.  She advised that she forgot but would call me but instead texted her response.  I can't support unprofessionalism.

Here is my recent bait and switch experience this week (1/18/21) when signing up for a member ship.
If you had a similar experience report it to Contact@fitnessintl.com as i did 
Hopefully it will prevent others from being scammed and or lied too. 

Below is a complaint letter I sent, explaining and naming those involved.  

Greetings customer service,

I am writing to bring to your attention a membership scam that is going on in one for your clubs. (St Petersburg, FL @4th St North)
This scam is being conducted at the GM and Assistant GM level.  

On tuesday Jan 18th, 2021 I was baited in with a below corporate pricing rate by your Assistant Manager Rose.  I was promised a rate of $300 for a National Signature Club membership.  I purchased 2, 1 for myself and 1 for my wife. ($600 total).  

Your GM Taylor sat with Rose and I to write this membership. He helped her with navigating through your system as she gave the impression as being a new hire. 
As we got to the totals I pointed out a ""balance owed"" that showed up on the screen.  They both assured me they would be overwriting it that same evening (1/18/21).  In addition, Rose said ""YOU HAVE MY WORD"" and explained she would follow up with me by 10am the next day (1/19/21) to illustrate the balance would go away.  

1-2 hours later that same night (1/18/21), I got a strange call from Sabrina, the Operations Manager questioning my balance.  I explained the above, I was told Taylor was going to overwrite it""  She began to rant about how Rose was going to pay my balance and how that having her pay the balance is not right so my memberships will have to be canceled.  
NOTE - Having anyone pay any balance was never discussed to me.  I was told Taylor would overwrite it. Thats is.  

There are more details (more misleading/lies when initiating my complaint) but I wanted to keep this fist email to share the main underlying issues.  

This is your GM and Assistant Manager
Who knows how many other cases where they have been successful in stealing money from LA fitness and or ripping off its customers in fraudulent agreements. 

Words cannot describe the disgust in lack of business & human ethics your senior managing employees are generating.  

I was told by ""Mathew I"" at your customer service headquarters that District Vice President Todd knew of this incident.  

On 1/20/21 I finally got a call from Todd  and he flat out lied to me as he stated "" I was on the phone with Rose when she was signing you up and you knew you'd have a balance due""   
It appears Todd the District VP condones and or participates in this misconduct.  What a disgusting culture.

I'm writing to you and will continue to go up the chain of command in hopes to find someone of integrity that can take ownership and reprimand such malpractice.  

For the record I have the text thread exposing the Assistant GM Rose baiting me in a ""paid in full"" rate they would later not honor and lie about.  
see attached.  So far no one from LA Fitness wants to own up to this..till they do you can enjoy the truth and be informed about how management of LA Fitness on 4th street in St Pete, FL operate. 

I hope to hear from high level Regional VP or higher that wants to make right.",2021-01-22 21:27:13,673,3324,

Their towing company has left a towing notice on multiple cars for no reason and when I called and asked, there was no answer.

Well they never moved them back so now instead of sharing a dumpster with 4 buildings, I'm sharing one with 8 buildings.

From delicious Benedict's to scrumptious pancakes and huevos rancheros, they got it all and it's all done well!  If you go on the weekend expect a wait, but it's worth it. From there coffee to their service, all too notch!  My husband and I recently had a Friday off so we thought we would go and have some breakfast before the weekend rush began. We eat here at least once a month and I am sorry I haven't written a review before, but everything is so amazing I get lost on food euphoria!  (My husbands also has been better at reminding me to get my reviews done, so kudos to him). This particular outing I tried the classic huevos rancheros and also a Pineapple Express pancake. My husband ordered the Eggs & a pancake combo and chose the pecan roll pancake. Our waitress was fantastic and kept the coffee cups filled with piping hot coffee ( they also supply French vanilla creamer which I appreciate). The meal came out quickly and OMG!  Drool worthy!  The huevos rancheros came with two tostadas, refried black beans, eggs cooked to order, cheese, red Chile sauce, green tomatillo sauce, pico de Gallo, queso fresco and avocado and a side of hash browns. I know it sounds like to much, but it all went so well together. I felt like Emi in Ratatouille.  They flavors are all great alone but together create a symphony on my tongue. My only criticism would be that they overlapped the two tostadas and piled everything in that overlapping center. So when I split the two, sometimes I got bites with everything's bd sometimes I did not. But it was still delicious. That would be the only thing I would change. Serve them as two separate tostadas so you can get all the saucy, flavorful ingredients in every bite. The pineapple pancake was to die for!  Pockets of orange, brown sugar and pineapple chunks made me feel like I was cheating and having cake for breakfast. It was topped with a vanilla bean cream cheese sauce and dollop of whipped cream. It came with syrup but didn't need the added sweetness.  It was perfect as is. My husbands pecan roll pancake taste just as the name implies. Candied pagans as well as cinnamon and vanilla were the complimenting flavors of a fluffy buttermilk pancake. Also served with the vanilla bean cream cheese sauce and whipped cream. I will always be back and next time I go I will get one of their famous Benedict's!  That's usually what I get but thought I'd go off book this time and try one of their other offerings.

One of their employees asked me if I was ready and as I sat down they said I had to redo my dip set. This isn't my typical nail salon I normally go to but I never had had to remove all my set to get a ""fill"" for dip nails. I told them that I have never had to do that before. She asked me what they normally do. I am not a nail artist so I don't have instructions. They then told me that another customer that walked in was in front of me and I had to wait longer (even after the fact of me sitting in front of them on the chair ready). I asked them why did I have to wait and they said that the other customer asked if they could grab coffee and come back. Being NYE I don't have any other choice but to wait. They will not be able to do my dip powder. She said she could only do acrylic at this time since I have reservations at 1PM. I told them I need to leave by 12:30PM. 

I originally asked for white nails but they told me that I basically had to go with the glitter. At that point I just told them to do whatever they needed to do to give me a fill and out right away.

I'm very disappointed at the service. I am happy they were able to at least make my nails look decent, yet this is not what I asked for.

Will not be coming back.

Also, Another lady had also came in and said she had an appointment and they told her that they didn't have her down. Had her check the time she called etc etc. 

You shouldn't overbook people if you can't do the service in time. I would have been more happy if they told me they didn't have any availability. I was in at 1110AM & out at 1245PM.",2021-01-01 00:43:23,431,1881,

I only recently started going to A&W again. After the drive-in closed, it kind of lost its appeal for me. Then I moved to Sparks and it was too far to drive for fast food. However, I had grown tired of the fast food options near my workplace so I started going to this location for a change of pace. 
My favorite is the mushroom swiss burger with onion rings. As far as fast food onion rings go I think A&W has the best! Crispy, tasty, served hot. No sauce or ketchup needed. I have recently discovered cheese curds and will definitely add these little delights to my normal order. They are like smaller mozzarella cheese sticks...only better! Again, no sauce needed and they reheat well too. 
The staff is always super friendly. One young lady in particular (I don't know her name, but I believe she is from The Philippines) makes my day with her cheerful attitude, happy tone of voice, and big smile! Sometimes the line can be long, but they do a pretty good job of getting everyone through the line as quick as possible. The food is always hot and fresh as if they took it off the grill, wrapped it up, and immediately handed the food out the window. I have not had the opportunity to dine inside at this location yet. The staff does wear masks and gloves right now to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Highly recommend checking A&W out next time you are looking for a different fast food place to visit!",2021-01-25 02:43:31,375,1748,

After that warranty ended, on 8/18/2020 I entered into a maintenance agreement with them for three years at a cost of $660.00. The agreement form which was dated 7/6/2020 was confirmed by them as a ""binding contract"" with their 8/18/2020 email, and did not require signature or made any reference to the fee as being non-refundable. Once they received my payment on 8/18/2020, however, they issued another agreement stating that the fee is ""non-refundable""!
On December 14, 2020 a new technician came to conduct the very first service. He climbed to my roof where the unit is located and after a few short minutes, he came with some pictures of the Heat Pump's exterior which were of no substance and gave me an estimate of $1,000.00 for required repairs covering replacement of the Condenser Motor and for injecting the HVAC Unit with A/C Renew. Because of the very short time this man stayed on the roof, during which he could not possibly have performed any of the eleven tasks listed in our agreement (i.e. checking the air flow, filter, safety controls, etc.), I called BreezeWays office to complain and requested that they send an experienced technician to perform these required functions.
Unfortunately, there was no satisfactory response and I decided to call another recommended Air Conditioning & Heating Co. to conduct an independent diagnosis of the unit without letting them know of what transpired earlier. Two of their technicians, with 20 years of experience on Heat Pumps, came and worked for 45 minutes. At the end, they concluded that there was nothing wrong with my unit; it was working normally and there was no need to replace the Condenser Motor or to inject the HVAC with any Renew!
In view of the above revelation and the overall unprofessional service I received from BreezeWays, I sent them a letter on 12/23/2020 stating that I now consider our agreement terminated for not fulfilling their obligations and requested reimbursement of my maintenance fee. Regrettably, they never responded and I had to submit my complain to BBB. BreezeWays continued to be stonewalling by incorrectly referring to their second agreement as a binding contract and making bogus claims. At the end, they offered to reimburse me only a small fraction of the fee, which was totally unacceptable. 
SO, BEWARE OF THEIR DECEIVING PRACTICE!",2021-01-28 17:10:55,471,2533,

My experience there, however, was less than ideal. First of all, this is a craft distillery, and I was looked at as if I was an alien for trying to order a tasting flight so that I could taste spirits and imfomatively purchase a bottle on the spot. I was offered to purchase one of their high end whisky flights (3 half oz pours of their schoonover whiskies) for 35 dollars!! That is equivalent of one shot for 35 bucks. On other hand was refused to purchase flight of other spirits (vodka, rum, gin, bourbon, Irish whiskey, peanut butter whiskey, coconut rum, cinnamon vodka). As a craft distillery officionado, who collects bottles in my bar at home, it is extremely extremely rare to be refused ability to obtain opportunity to sample (especially by purchase) the spirits. Furthermore, I had visited Bloomingtons Big Woods a year or so ago and purchased tasting flight no problem! Just odd. I ended up paying 14 dollars for a neat pour of there bourbon (not high end). Bourbon fairly smooth. As a future garage visitor weekly at minimum, will likely be back and am open to modify review in future, but as of now, certainly worst experience from distillery I have had in quite some time. To craft spirit lovers, if you want to visit a place excited to share their craft, visit others (west fork, 8th day, hotel tango, 1205, wilderland) who off flights to excitedly share the taste of their craft!",2021-01-12 02:33:08,323,1550,

My non-vegan sister actually recommended this place and said it's one of her favorite place to go for drinks & small plates. We got a ton of food and here are my reviews:

Zucchini crab cake sliders: One of the best ""crab cake"" sliders I've had! It looks like zucchini, but it actually has a great crabby flavor. The bun was super soft and I loved the old bay remoulade.

Potato Croquettes: Omg. So different and amazing! They look like tater tots but when you bite into one, it's like a soft pillowy cloud of potato. The chipotle aioli it comes with gives it a nice kick. You also get a lot in one order! Maybe about 10.

Roasted Brussels Sprouts: These were good! I like my brussels really soft so I wish these were cooked a little longer, but they had a fantastic smokey flavor and I love the sweetness that the cranberries added.

Wild Mushroom Toast: This seems fancy with all the different types of mushrooms. The bread got a little soggy during takeout, but the overall flavor was like a mushroom explosion in your mouth. It was pretty big and great to split between 2 people.

Eggplant Bao Buns: The crowd favorite of the night! The eggplant had almost a teriyaki flavor, the buns were so soft and fluffy, and the sweet hoisin sauce was perfect. There are 3 to an order. I wish I didn't have to share!

Everything ran us about $75 for delivery and was a good amount of food for 2 people. Overall, I'd highly recommend going here whether you are vegan or not! You won't be disappointed.",2021-01-20 17:33:49,340,1579,

However, once I found out I had my first cavity I was a bit concerned to get the filling done. Especially since anytime needles are involved I have a tendency to pass out. I have always had great dentists and I think that is part of why I have enjoyed going to the dentist, but at Mass Ave Family Dentistry you are not just getting a fantastic dentist--you are also getting a great team that works well together. 

Once I informed the dental hygienist, Amanda that I could pass out I was amazed at the extra steps that they took to ensure for both my safety and comfort. Shannon, who was shadowing for the day, and Amanda both did a fantastic job of keeping me talking and making sure that I was feeling ok.  Dr.So and Amanda did an amazing job on my filling, it is not noticeable at all and has not changed my bite or smile. 

I also needed to get part of my permanent retainer fixed and I appreciated that Dr.So and the receptionists let me know that it would likely be cheaper to get it done at my orthodontist's. I think it says a lot about the quality of healthcare professionals when a healthcare office lets you know that there might be cheaper alternatives for the same work! In the end, I decided to get my retainer fixed by Dr.So and Amanda instead of traveling to get it fixed at my orthodontist's office.

I'm actually shocked that I somehow haven't written a review. Complete blasphemy! Where do I even start? Their salads are a gift from the Heavens. The garden salad has preserved lemons and homemade ranch- so good. I'm not a big Caesar salad fan, but their's is beyond. But, the best salad there is asking them to mix the feta salad with the Caesar to create a dreamy, creamy, salty amazing beauty of a salad! I literally crave this salad on a weekly basis and order it every single time I visit.

Next up, the best burger I've ever tasted. The beef is divine, the crispy havarti cheese goes perfectly, and the garlic Mayo is superb. When I had my first bite, I about died at how good it was and literally told everyone I knew and now they are also obsessed. Their garlic parmesan fries are also crispy, garlicky perfection. I dip them in the garlic Mayo. Their lettuce wraps are the bomb and such a welcome lighter alternative for lunch with so much flavor!

For appetizers, I have had the crab meat in butter (insanely delicious), crab stuffed mushrooms, pork belly, and fried pickles and all are great! My fave would be the crab stuffed mushrooms if I had to choose one.

Now, onto dinner. I have had the ribeye several times and it is divine! Amazingly seasoned, perfectly marbled as a ribeye should be, and the seasoning is perfection. Cannot recommend it enough and it can easily be shared with two people. I highly recommend it. I have also had scallops here and they were also fantastic! You seriously can't go wrong.

Finally, their cocktails should not be missed. They have tiki cocktails including a painkiller that is so refreshing, delicious, and fun to look at! They also make a mean dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives and they have an entire menu dedicated to hand crafted cocktails.

For special occasions they bring out a chocolate torte and it is so luxurious and smooth. Such a nice and yummy touch. The service is always upstanding as well. We haven't been disappointed. If you can't tell, I highly recommend Moussalli's and I even recommend driving over from STL to have an amazing meal here!",2021-01-20 03:15:12,457,2221,

Meal: we had the fries for appetizer, first time for us and repeat for my friend. We liked... it was very good.

I ordered a sirloin, everyone s food came out great but my steak. It was stringy or grainy like fatty it was dry and mushy grainy if that makes any sense. It didn't taste like any sirloin I've gotten anywhere before. The manager comp that. We disnt ask for that, he offered. It was very nice of him. I enjoyed my sweet potato! I ordered a salad with extra egg (didn't get any egg at all) until the waiter brought it after asking. 

Waiter: He was decent at first. Up beat, funny. And then I don't know if we did something or offended him or what but his attitude just flipped. My friend asked for rolls to go... that took 15 mins. My husband asked for 2 more cokes (we received 2 more margaritas and then 1 coke) I'm like I'll take it its ok to me! My friend was like disnyou ask us if we wanted another? Because I don't remember (we did not ask him for one) he did however walk by our table and mumble yes 2 more margaritas and kept walking. We could not catch him. I thought that was weird. So we start on our 2nd margaritas! Then he comes over like starting small talk and tells us there is 75 people waiting to get into the restaurant some of them waiting 2.5 hours. My husband swore the dude was trying to get rid of us... I'm like no, he's just tell us. LOL. My husband ended up being correct. Waiter for got my friends rolls... my friend proceeded to ask he said yea bit tired on heels in the middle of talk and walked away. Tossed the box on the table and walked off. I'm like no. I said hey, hey, excise me, hello... he lifts up his right hand and proceeds to walk off..... 

I flagged down the manager we explained everything. That it was just straight up rude. Thats all. If he was mad because we were their to long or what I am still not sure. I will NOT be going back to southport. The manager was very nice! We had a good time other than that and that's all that matters...

After standing like a dear caught in head lights we noticed a cash register so we approached and waiting to be helped. Apparently our Yelp reservation was odd, but ok a online table set up that day could be odd.
So we ordered and that was no big deal. We thought we had set up our order for half of our food dine in and the other half to go, no big deal.
Well our fries showed up pretty fast, and they were great. We thought the rest of our order ( calzone and a pizza) would have followed shortly. 55mins later all of our food was dropped off at our table without any indication it was ours.
Well it was and our pizza was cold and so was our calzone, but a fresh batch of fries, togo was with the rest of our order. It appears our fries were delivered for dine in and the rest of our order was sat in the back, not sure why. Again maybe it's the way I ordered with half of our order to go and half dine in.
Fortunately our air fryer at home helped our cold calzone and well , some pizza is good cold. The fries again were awesome  , super crispy.
All in all, I bet if I hadn't ordered half to go ,half dine in maybe my all of my order would have been hot and fresh.
We'll definitely try a different location for a TOGO order only.
Maybe it was just me, maybe my ordering was different, who knows. Had high hopes for a good experience dining in but it just didn't happen.

Essentially the issue I had with them was in regards to a routine Tune-Up. I had a tune-up done while I was in the office and made sure to let them know verbally over the phone and I believe through the work order from my homeowners insurance that I would not be here. The Tech performed the tune-up and removed a previously dirty filter and never replaced it. The company claims it does not change filters, this is where the issue lies. I never received a phone call as the home owner, who again to mention was not there for this service request. They claimed the invoice said to change the filter. On the invoice which I have attached you can see where it says, ""Change Filter within 30-45 Days"". I have now spoken with numerous individuals and other fellow investors in the Bates-Hendricks and Fountain square area as well as a phenomenal Heating & Cooling company here locally. We all agree on that the statement essentially meaning ""We changed the filter and you need to change it within 30-45 Days"" That lack of communication verbally and the invoice miscommunication has caused some issues now. I have to pay out of pocket 375$ for a coil cleaning,  When I feel as though it could have been easily avoided. The tenant has a Husky and I can just wonder how the system looks since the filter was taken out 2 months ago. The ""AMADA"" furnace I have says to change the filter within 2-3 Months on their website according to the Model #. The owner did try to reach out for me which I am grateful for, the only issue was that the solution seemed redundant as he was charging me more than the competitor was, as if I was going to provide HRS more business... The only reason why I entertained it was I assumed it would be an act of good faith - In which would be interconnected to his apology about miscommunication and that he would charge me significantly less than competitors in an attempt to rectify the issue. Instead he wanted a written offer for a coil cleaning from this competitor and was willing to go 25$ Less. This issue does lie on the technician and HRS not having follow up calls. I nor other investors that I am associated with, with a total of 9 properties will never go through them again.

I have avoided eating here because...well, its a grocery store deli. If they had good food, they would be the 1st among grocery stores to pass this milestone. My wife says she loves the salads here, so I decided to go with her and give the give them ""A Go"".

Albertsons claim to fame here is their variety. Typically, when a place tries to take on this much variety, they don't do any of it very well. I walked in though with high hopes that I would find Albertsons to be the exception to the rule.

They offer Hamburgers, Sushi, Brick-oven Pizza, Gyros, BBQ and more. I ordered the, wait for it...... Hamburger. For those that know me, and my reviews, I review more hamburgers than anything else because I love me a good burger.

Specifically I had their Bulgogi Burger. It's touted as a unique Korean burger with Kimchi Mayo, Daikon, Gochujang and Rice Noodles. The 1st thing to note here is time. If you come here in the hopes of a quick lunch, think again. 

Each of their specialty places to eat are separate. Its like having several different restaurants under the same roof. A cool idea. I actually had an idea similar to this many years ago, but I did not have the funding to build it. 

The problem is that each of these places will only take and cook your order. This is the 1st line you have to contend with. Next you have to actually pay for your food. For this you have to walk to another area. When I came here for lunch, there was only 1 cashier working. This line was long. 

Imagine all these specialty food areas having to converge into 1 payment line. It creates a huge bottleneck like a 6-lane road merging into 1 lane. I timed how long it took from the time I placed my order until I paid for it. 25 minutes.

When I finally got my food, paid for it, and found a table to sit at, I opened up the box to eat. 

Fries
The fries were good and crispy but not fresh. On my 1 to 10 scale, I would give them a solid 6 mostly because they did not taste like they were from frozen.

Burger
Next, I came to the burger, which tasted like Korean BBQ. Tangy, sweet and sour at the same time. The patty was dry, which was from the person that cooked it smashing it on the grill with her spatula. Maybe she thought she was working at Smash Burger.

Why people smash their patties I am not sure. I used to do this mostly because it looks cool when the grease from the burger drips onto the charcoal and flames up. 

I finally came to realize that aside from the cool factor, the only thing smashing accomplishes is draining all the juices from your burger resulting in a dry and tasteless patty. 

In the words of the Red Queen; ""Off with its head.""

The burger was first cooked on a grill, and then transferred to flat top to finish it. Normally cooks use this Technique because the grill gives the patty that good smoky backyard BBQ burger, while the flat top allows building a nice crust on the patty. 

The way its supposed to work is the cook then puts a little Beef Broth on the flat top, and puts a lid over the patty to build up some steam melting the cheese over the meat and also further flavoring the patty. I watched the person cooking my patty and she did not do this.

On my 1 to 10 scale, I give the hamburger a 4, which is a pretty good rating for super market food.",2021-01-01 00:00:57,735,3385,

The drinks are really good, a tad pricey, but I like them a lot so that's cool with me. The atmosphere of the restaurant is amazing, love the decor and the layout and the ""feel"" of being there. The menu is a little... Idk it's expensive and some of the items are a little too funky. The Rasta far fries I've had a few times, sometimes I LOVE them and other times I regret buying them because they're not worth finishing (I love potatoes and I almost never think a potato dish isn't worth finishing). We went again last night and half the entire menu was  sold out. There were 4 of us, and 3 of us had to change our orders when we were told what was sold out (it was a Saturday night and we were told *after* we'd spent 10 minutes or so perusing the menu and had all decided what we wanted. Like, we already had our drinks before we were told that 4 of the main entrees and one of the sandwiches were sold out. Had We been told earlier, we probably wouldn't have been quite as disappointed). I enjoyed the night, but 2 out of 4 of our group said they wouldn't go back, so I took off 1 star. Also, I like the food generally, but there's nothing that I crave. So, I never think ""oooh let's go to Ella's!"" Oh and they had blankets to offer if you're sitting outside, which was awesome! But apparently the blankets are $2 (you get to keep them). We would have used the blankets even if we knew there was a charge, but I wish we would have been told of the charge ahead of time. Like, $2 is more than fair, but we would still like to know, you know? 

Other than being out of food, we had multiple dishes come out without the alterations requested. The fries had the sriracha on them instead of on the side (I love spicy, but other at my table can't eat it). One burger was wrong 2 times (first time asked for no relish, extra pickles, and it came with relish and no pickles and it had the wrong side. the second time it was literally just the meat and the bun, like no toppings on it). The third time it came out perfect, and it was cooked perfectly etc. so they did make it right. Unfortunately, this was one of the people who already had to change their order because the 2 items on the menu they actually wanted were sold out. So that person was extremely disappointed in their experience (to make it worse, they were the DD for the evening, so they didn't even get to enjoy the drinks). No manager came out to apologize. And I was told I was ""never allowed to pick the restaurant again"". So... now I'm gonna be stuck eating Hot Pot and Mongolian Grills with these friends in the future and those are not my favorite types of places, the restaurant lost a star just because they took away my voting rights when it comes to choosing restaurants  

Finally, covid precautions! 10/10 would recommend them for how seriously they take this pandemic. Spacing seating even outside. Sanitizer on the tables. The employees that I saw all were wearing properly fitting masks (no noses peaking out). I was thorough impressed by that! They definitely got an extra star because of this.  I'd heard their precautions were great, and that's why I chose to go there. Thank you for putting in the extra effort to keep your employees and your customers safe!!!",2021-01-17 16:31:27,749,3359,

To be honest, one of the reasons we wanted to go right away was we knew the food would be best (actually could also be a total bomb, but we took a risk that a chain restaurant would be more prepared for a grand opening, plus they'd been selling to-gos) on this day, and we were right. All the dishes were very fresh and very on point with the flavors.  Since we had a small group, we were able to sample a few dishes, I can't say I had anything bad or anything not great. My wife loves crab cakes, and upon hearing that they were filled with crab, and not fillers like most crab cakes, we ordered an order plus more. They were definitely great. The most memorable item I would order as an extra side dish next time was the Pan Fried Oysters. It was just fresh and--this is why it's memorable. It was GOOD, and you can pick your preferred doneness.  We asked for it to be fully cooked, and it came out just perfect. I love the taste of cooked (fried to be exact) oysters. I'm sure for most people who have never had fried oysters, it'll be an acquired texture. But, I can't say enough about the oysters. All in all, dinner was great. We will definitely be back. We just hope the restaurant keeps up the level of quality that so many restaurants around here fail to uphold after the grand opening excitement is over.

Ya, I was wrong. The person who helped me then didn't know a damn thing about Trusts. Good thing during my divorce I had it revoked and created a new one. But joke on me again. That attorney didn't create a Trust either, she made a simple will.  So in December, I wanted to make an investment and use my Trust to protect it.  That's when I discovered previous work wasn't correct. 

Attorneys were horribly expensive. And for years I have heard Lifeline Estate Services on KKOH. I called and made an appointment. 

My initial appointment was with John Rhoads, an owner. Allow two hours and come prepared with names, addresses and phone numbers.  John takes his time to walk you all the information of why a Trust is more important and necessary than a will. Bringing up concerns and questions I wasn't previously aware of. Then answering them all. My return appointment was a month later after a book of documents had been prepared for me specifically. Allow another couple of hours for this appointment too. As John went through each page to make sure they were correct and I understood what they would do for me. 

Lifeline created a document that can easily be amended in the future if necessary, where previous documents were not. Lifeline thought of provisions and circumstances I hadn't, and gave me the opportunity to cover all my bases now for the rest of my life.  Not only did I receive a book for my documents to take home, but they have an electronic copy in their office.  Cards for my wallet and car in case an accident renders me unable to make my choices known.  Again so very thorough. 

It was an investment well spent. I only wished I had used them 20 years ago. 

Plenty of parking. The entrance was a bit tricky the first visit. The building is in the very back on the north east corner. The entrance is on the south side, side entrance of the building.

Now for the review, and be warned I worked in hospitality for 20 years so I'm picky. 
To start with we ate at the bar which I hardly ever do because I'm 5'4"" and stools are hard for me cause I tend to slide off if there isn't a high enough foot rest, which they have. The 2 hosts were very warm and jovial. Someone had just left so they ran over and cleaned the seats and counter for us and joked with me about my challenges with stools since I told them not to laugh if I slide off the stool. Have to have some jocularity during COVID. 
I ordered the smoked salmon on the wheatberry toast. I asked for avocado instead of cream cheese. I chose the toast over the bagel hoping the toast was not a thick cut but it was. Next time I'll ask if they have other options for the toast. They had no problems accommodating my request. It was very good and I would give this a 5 star item on the menu. The coffee was too strong for me but I have that problem at most diners. 
My roommate had the short stack pancakes with bananas on the side. They arrived with the bananas in the pancake. Our server offered to take it back and have it remade but my roommate said it was ok. He regrets it now but he also agreed to it and he doesn't blame the restaurant for the choice he made. He did say the pancakes were very good and would order them again with the bananas on the side. 
He also thought the decaf coffee was a little too strong but he doesn't like a dark roasted coffee. The orange juice was good as well. 

Our server was very attentive. They all had masks on and their pastry case was full of individually wrapped pieces of fresh cake. We did not partake in the deserts

I called Fitgerald's and gave them the details of my cars age and mileage and was told my car was still under warranty as it was less than 4 years old and only had 78000 miles, I explained what part had failed and was told that part is covered under my warranty, so I booked it in for warranty repair. When I arrived I was told there was a $160 fee to diagnose the issue, I explained it had already been diagnosed and I had already been told it was covered under warranty. I was told this is a standard charge and as long as it was covered there would be no charge to me. A couple of hours later I received a call to say it was not covered under warranty and to replace the oil switch it was $220, I reminded the advisor that I had been told when I called in that it was covered and if they had told me it was not i would of had it repaired somewhere else. Now I am Trapped!!!! I either have to pay the diagnostic fee of $160 and then pay my local oil change center to replace it or pay the $220.
I think this is a very misleading practice, telling a customer on the phone the repair is covered by warranty and then entrapping them with a Diagnostic fee and then denying the claim on a part they original said was covered by warranty. I would never use them again, and have never experienced this bait and switch at the othey Hyundai Dealers  have used such as Crown Hyundai or the Coutesey Hyundai.",2021-01-13 22:52:31,333,1576,

Not a big beer drinker so it's nice to pay by the ounce and be able to get a little as I want per round and try more varieties of beer and not have to force to drink a 16 oz of beer that I'm not that into. Would have given this place five stars but service is very poor. Our server was good; no complaints about that aspect. But upon check in, we were quoted a time and as we walked away we got a text saying our table was ready so we went back to the host stand and we were told he just pressed the wrong button; no big deal. So we asked about the beer wall and we were told he had to wait for his ""friend""... which I personally feel they should be offering the beer wall right at check in, that's a money maker and people would literally not mind waiting if they had drinks... then, people that came in after us started getting sat before us because since we were texted 30 minutes prior that the table was ready(even though it wasn't) we were removed from the wait list; it was pretty frustrating. After getting our table, Our food was delivered to the wrong table and the runners just left it there without checking.

I met with Dr. Windl and he was phenomenal as well as all the techs that do the cleaning and the real hard work . They are pretty diligent in maintaining contact and working with any schedule. I've been attending for about a year. 

I am currently sitting in Dental Arts typing this because I'm struggling with the now two interactions I've had with this woman answering the phones. I called earlier to confirm and I spoke with her. She picks up, announces herself and I say, ""Hi! I'd like to confirm my appointment I can't remember if it's 2 or 2:30p."" Now I imagined as with all previous interactions I've had with literally anyone on the face of the planet I've talked to at a doctor's office...that she'd say something along the lines of ""ok great, can I have your name?"" Instead, I get a sarcastic, ""well your number says wireless caller so I'm going to need your name to figure that out."" Tone is a powerful thing and hers was not friendly. But I let it go and gave her my information. I figured who knows what kind of day this woman has had and I let it go. Fast forward and I come in and I am encountering this woman for a second time. Usually there's a check in to write your name on but I imagine they took it away due to COVID. so she's on the phone and I stand there until she's done so I can let her know I'm here. She gets off the phone. Can I help you? ""Yes, I'm checking in for my appointment."" Once AGAIN I get a sarcastic remark. How about SURE WHATS YOUR NAME? Like maybe it's me? Am I asking too much? Am I being to sensitive?! But when she walked away another young lady came up and did the EXACT THINGS I was expecting from the other lady!!!!!

This is not a large market (see interior pic), but it has a variety of fresh seafood offerings, standard pricing, & it offers excellent service. (Brent was really good.) Currently, due to Covid fears, only one customer may enter the market @ a time. There's a helpful marquee beside the front door; it lists all the latest fresh catches. 

Family-owned & operated Lockhart's has its own dock and boats, w/ most of the seafood self-supplied. (Salmon & one or two other seafood selections are shipped in from outside areas, but whenever quality local seafood is available, it's what you'll find here.) The only fish that was previously frozen is Cod. 

Along w/ different fishes, there was shrimp, clams, stone crab, & a fish spread available today. (The sushi-grade tuna looked divine!) I didn't see lobsters, snow crab, blue crab, conch, crayfish, octopus & oysters, but I know they are sold here whenever possible.  

There's also a wall freezer that is filled w/ seafood items such as chowders, etc (see pic) & shelves w/ a small offering of sauces & seasonings, etc. 

Brent answered questions thoroughly, explained the business, offered to let me buy just half of the Little Neck clams, & asked if I wanted ice to keep my fish & clams cold on the trip home. 

The Grouper Cheeks @ $11.99 lb were so fresh-- just excellent pieces. (If you've never eaten cheeks, you're missing out!) I paid $15.99 for 50 Littlenecks, which were delicious, & the sweet Red Grouper @ $20.99 lb was a
great catch. (No pun intended:)

Lockhart's ships its seafood. Wholesale options are available. Now that City Girl Seafood in Hudson is closed, this will most likely be my GO TO place whenever I'm craving fresh seafood or am having company. What I purchased today was just SOOO much better than what I've found elsewhere. Sometimes smaller is definitely better-- such a great little market!",2021-01-10 07:00:30,433,2049,

When the sleet started at 6:00p we were afraid they would cancel the remaining tours. We dressed appropriately and headed for our 7:00p tour. Due to the sleet, the 6:30 tour was postponed and a extremely long line was still waiting when we arrived. It was now only snow so the staff was salting the entire garden path for the guest's safety. The wait was enjoyable watching kids and families playing in the snow, children were throwing snowballs and little one's were mesmerized by the snow.

This year tickets were scanned outdoors and the tour began outdoors rather than going through the museum like 2019. It eliminated the personal  overheating while waiting in an indoor line like last year and I found this year easier overall. I hope they continue starting the tour outdoors since we're already dressed for winter conditions.

Imagine viewing a million lights in  90 minutes along the garden trails of Newfields while sipping your hot beverage (alcohol or non- alcohol). The lights were beyond phenomenal and every inch of the tour was spectacular. The highlight for us was the lights In front of the Lily House choreographed to music. We personally stayed through 4 or 5 cycles. Massive trees were entwined in gorgeous lights, several firepits were available to warm us up along the way, different colored lights accented the landscaping and a well thought out social distancing path worked nicely. There is a make your own S'mores area which was very popular as well as the drink stations throughout the tour. This year, due to the pandemic, the path to the Lily House was directional to maintain social distancing and it functioned well. Other directions of the tour changed this year in different locations than last year to keep social distancing safe. 

There were several obvious photo opportunities throughout the tour. People were taking full advantage of the arbors, arches and gorgeous locations for fun photos.

If you're just reading this, I hate to tell you the tickets are sold out for this season. Add this event to your calendar on November 2021 so your family can exeperience this unique experience first hand. We had a fabulous time, as always, and you will, too.",2021-01-01 00:42:33,448,2408,

Today I placed an online order for a 5:30 pick up. I got there a little early about 5:15. After waiting about 5 or more minutes I was asked for my name. A woman checked the warmer behind the register then the computer then walked back to the kitchen. After about 5 minutes she came out and said yours is up on the screen and should be about 5-10 minutes. As people who came in after me with later pick-up times picked theirs up I finally asked again after 15 more minutes. The food finally came out and I attempted to pay. I had 3 $5 gift cards and tried to use the first one. The girl made a mistake and ran it for $15 instead of $5 one at a time. She did something and said to run the 2nd of the 3 cards. It did not work. She said she wanted to wait for the manager (was told his name is Allan) who was on the phone and when he got off instead of addressing us who were waiting, he assisted a doordash customer. Then after taking care of her he attempted to take care of the next customer. I waved my hands in the air and said woah what about me, even the girl said no were waiting for you. I hand all 3 cards over, He attempts to run a card again it still would not work. I said I don't know whats happened all I know is that I have been ignored, the girl forgot to tell him she ran a card for the wrong dollar value, someone had an issue with their gift cards with red hair before me (who came in after me ) and the register girl had her run her card twice as well.  The manager says you'll need to possibly redeem them or call someone. I then explain how frustrated this entire experience has been and what can be done I need to get dinner home to my 7-year-old. He says to me ""I am not taking care of your food""! I thought what? I didn't ask for a free meal, I asked for a suggestion to make things right and at least apologize. I was so upset I said I no longer want your food I'll voice my opinion/experience online, stopped at Mcdonalds to get her a happy meal, and went home. There are too many other options (Milers, Magerks, Brickhouse) for this type of food to keep getting these results and this type of treatment.

Update- The manager that I dealt with last night called me today. He said he did not know why the $5 gift cards did not work and added the money back on and left them in the office. Had this happened last night things would have been different. It was nice to get an apology but they can keep the $15 as I do not see myself going back with my past experiences",2021-01-12 14:48:22,587,2655,

It's a quaint little place in an unassuming strip center that is under major construction and renovation. The only reason the 3 existing restaurants are still in business is because they are offering top notch food (but I'll save reviews of Panai Thai and Juicy Seafood for their own reviews).

After reading that the bread is delivered fresh from a local bakery every day and that the fries are handcut, I knew I'd found a gem. I order the Roo Roo Reuben on marbled rye and had the accompanying fries. Bitesquad estimated delivery: 45 minutes. Roo Roo's pickup: 10 minutes. I wanted hot and fresh!

Upon arrival (10 minutes later), I pulled up to Roo Roo's around 12:30pm on a Friday, and they had about 4-5 tables of customers in a rather small, olde country feel diner decked in reds and whites. The staff wore masks; the eating patrons did not. Not the best place for social distancing, but there were 2 small tables outside on the sidewalk.

The food was packed and ready (thankfully without all of the extra plasticware the is unnecessarily thrown into almost any bag for takeout). At $10, the price point was reasonable.

I decided to roll the dice and wait until I got home to open my food, ensuring warmth was retained on the ride home.

Wowwee! It was plum packed full of homemade hand cut fries beautifully browned and a gorgeous, melty and perfectly balanced reuben. This isn't a New York deli type of reuben with miles of meat, but the fillings were evenly portioned and spread amongst the two slices of local bread.

The food tasted as good as it looked. I did add some salt to the fries to meet my liking. I will definitely be back! (Looks like they throw a great punch for breakfast too!)

NOTE: This is a breakfast/lunch place, so make sure to order plenty before 2pm!",2021-01-15 19:24:08,412,1989,

There is so much to say about this restaurant. First, I am from Florida and we DINED OUTDOORS.... DURING WINTER!!!!  The outdoor dining setup is quite unique. Cattycorner to the restaurant is a brick paved sidewalk with arched entryways in the middle of 2nd street. The restaurant has commandeered a section of this sidewalk that provides for great al fresco dining (even in the dead of winter) and makes for an elegant space. They have heat lamps and clear plastic that blocks the cross-breeze and they also have a few pretty cool yurts! Never thought that I would witness a day where dining in yurts on a sidewalk to protect you from dangerous air is a thing but here we are! 

Now to walk you through my experience beginning with the reservation process. We booked a table for 3 the eve before new year's eve. So last minute, I know! We booked online and called to confirm. Joetta was great! She was so pleasant and despite all the mix-ups (my friend is weird and books online under a different surname.‍ I called and provided his real name and of course everyone was super confused!). 

Victor greeted us at our table. He too was pleasant and sent a hello from Joetta. He made note that he recalled from Joetta that we were Floridians (its the little things). Makenzie (not sure if I spelled that correctly) was our server for the evening. Despite the chill in the air, she made our dining experience so warm. She was almost always there when we needed and despite the ""full house"", her service was prompt.

Now I could drag on and on about the food but if you look at the pictures, there isn't much else to be said. Everything was beautifully plated. Despite the runners bringing food from across the street, each dish came out timely and hot. EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT!  The seared salmon and the filet mignon were perfectly served at medium, the brodetto had ample seafood galore and the risotto.... Risotto risotto ... I am still having dreams about the risotto.  We had so much food to eat and enough leftover to enjoy as a full meal. We ate and were served like kings and a queen on our NYE night in Philly.",2021-01-26 00:31:39,437,2131,

The first time I placed an order on the phone. I stood in line for. Few minutes looking at the people la cooking food with their masks around their chins, and one of the girls working the register with her mask around her chin. She was taking orders and helping to pack up the food. I contemplated my order for a minute and decided that I didnt want to take the risk of getting Covid from somebody who may not know they have it, and left.
Went back during the daytime amd everybody was wearing masks. 
Came back tonight and again, 2 girls taking orders with masks around their chins. And people cooking food with their masks pulled down. I placed my order and watched the whole 15 minutes it took for them to finish my order while they didnt put their masks up not once. I heard them making fun of one of the other workers masks. I really wanted the food but when it came out I just couldnt do it. I demanded a refund. To the girl who gave me the refund, she had her mask on the entire time, she's a champ and those 2 stars are for her only.
I wasnt very nice to her but she was very polite to me. I'm sorry I went Karen on you. You are not the problem here, the others without masks are.
Theu said the masks are only off for a moment when they are not handling food. But both times I watched them for 10 plus minutes cooking, handling food, and packaging it up for customers. That is not the case.
Here's the thing. I know people who got Covid 8 months ago and are still fatigued and exhausted. They still have headaches. Their senses of smell and taste have not returned. They cant exercise because their blood oxygen levels still have not returned to normal, not to mention the people who have just straight up died from it. You can have the virus for 2 weeks before you start showing symptoms. How many people are coming in and out of that resteraunt every day? How many people's food could you contaminate during that time? How many people will get sick and have some very serious long term side effects even after making a speedy recovery? Pretty cavalier to be ok with affecting other people's lives like that. This is highly unethical. My guess is that either management doesnt know, or management is the problem. This seems to be a night shift issue as I have been here during the day and not had the same issue. The owners of this resteraunt need to get their employees in order or let them go.

Well I can say now that I will NEVER return to this wing stop location. I will have a tl;dr at the end of this story but if you want an honest review stick around. So I got off of work (13 hour shift) and when I got home around 2200 I decided to order wing stop delivery (one to prevent any risk of exposure to covid either from me to the restaurant staff or vice versa.) My order was simple, 2 meals with fries and corn all with extra seasoning and well done and a drink. It took 55 minutes from the time I ordered till I received my food which was about 2300. When I looked at my food, I was literally shocked. I received the GROSSEST looking plain wings I have ever set my eyes on. To the point that the chicken didn't even look like salt and pepper were put on it, and this was with every single wing I ordered. The fries were so soggy for being well done they might as well had served me fries from the week before. The corn was undercooked and the kettles were so hard that it was pretty much raw corn and again no seasoning AT ALL. So much for my extra seasoning option. And to top it off, they didn't even supply a straw for the drink. All of this made me upset but none-the-less I told my self ,""Hey, it's Saturday night, I'll just call and see if I can get it refunded"" this is where it all starts. The first person I talk to is the ""assistant manager"". She puts me on hold which I oblige and end up waiting 15 minutes. I ended the call and called back. The assistant manager answers again and I explain I was on hold for 15 minutes and never got back to. She tells me ""Sir you were not waiting 15 minutes, I have customers in front of me and I can not talk, I will put you on hold for one minute and be right with you"" upset even more I oblige. 2 minutes later I hear the line pick up and I say hello over and over and then the line disconnects. Now I'm just pi**ed off. I call back for a 3rd time and get an associate who was actually very nice. I explain my story and she is sorry for the mistake to the food. She takes my name and number and says ,""the manager is currently busy but she will get back to you tomorrow"" I agree and hang the phone up. I get a call from wing stop 20 minutes later (about 2350 now) and it's the assistant manager again. She starts belittling me and saying my claims are ""false"" and they ""it's a saturday night, what do you expect?"" HA EXCUSE ME BUT I EXPECT TO RECEIVE THE RIGHT ORDER OF FOOD THAT I PAID ALMOST $50 FOR. She then just starts going on and on on how she's not giving me anything but she'll make me a new batch of corn if I come to the restaurant. LOL yea lemme drive 30 minutes round trip for $5 of corn at 2355 when I have work in the morning. I explain to her that It's not just the corn that's messed up, it's my entire meal and she says ""well thats what I can do"" I tell her to just have her manager call me tomorrow like the associate previously discussed. I start heading to bed and receive a call at 0005 and it's the manager. I explain to her my situation, she looks up the order and has the AUDACITY to say ,""Sir I cooked that order, I know it's right, so you can either bring the food here now and we'll refund you or I can do nothing and you can keep the food"" HAHAHAHAHAAHA. I literally laughed on the phone. I explained to her ,""so you want me to drive there now after midnight to fix a mistake On your end, absolutely not, one the unprofessionalism from this particular establishment is through the roof! I've been belittled by your AM and now you? The only person helpful there was an associate. I have work early in the morning and I'm not able to take the food back to you now or when you open tomorrow"" THIS MANAGER HAS THE BA**S TO HANG UP ON ME MID SENTENCE. I threw the food away and I will never ever ever return to this wing stop or probably any for a long time. The managers that work here act like kids and I'm sure they do this to many other people. Avoid this place like covid and you'll be good. tl;dr: Manager messed up my food but couldn't admit her faults, and then hung up on me instead of taking corrective action, AM acted like a kid and only thinks about corn, don't go here.",2021-01-11 17:19:31,984,4294,

I placed my order at their online site at 5:30pm.  It arrived AFTER 7:15. It was over an hour late, after several calls and arguing, being lied to, and after several requests to cancel and refund. On arrival, the order was wrong.

The longer version of the story. After placing my order at 5:30 an email came through at 5:31 stating the order had been recieved and accepted with an expected arrival time of 6:15. 

Having ordered several times from them before, I knew not to expect the order on time. Typically, orders from CJ Wok would arrive to me at aproximately the one hour mark. 

For the record, they are under 3 miles away.

At aproximately 6:30 I called the phone number in the email to inquire about arrival time and the call was routed to what sounded like a fax machine. I dialed back several times and to hear the same electronic noises.

I went online to the site I ordered from and called the *different* number that was on the site. The time of that call was 6:35.  

The person who answered the main number first told me the order was ""on the way"" and also that they had no way to check the status of online orders and that I should call another number. This was the number in the email. 

I explained that nobody had answered and that it sound like it had gone to what sounded like a fax. She argued with me that there was no fax machine on the other line.

I took her word for it that the order was on the way.

I tried the number that didn't answer a few more times at 6:40 and 6:48 when the order hadn't yet shown up.  They number either went to the fax or was busy.

At 6:50 I phoned the main number again. Again, they said my order was on the way.  I explained that i had called 15 minutes earlier and asked if they 'actually knew the order was on the way of if they were making things up?'

They again told me to call the other number and I again explained I had but that there was still no answer and that the phone was going to what sounded like a fax or busy. We argued again.  

***It was at this point I first asked to cancel the order and be refunded.***

I was told they couldn't cancel an online order and that is have to call the other number.

I AGAIN explained that number wasn't answering.

They told me they would have the boss call me.

I waited another 20 minutes and there was no delivery nor was there a call from ""the boss.""

I called the main number AGAIN at 7:10. I asked for the order to just be canceled and refunded. 

They again told me I would have to call the other number.

Between 7:11 and 7:16 I called a few more times and got the fax noise. At 7:16 someone finally answered. 

It was the SAME VOICE I'd been speaking to at the other number.

I gave the benefit of the doubt, explained my situation and asked for my order to be refunded.

They told me my order was on the way and that they couldn't refund an online order.  

I replied that I didn't believe them anymore and again asked how to get my order refunded.

While we argued the delivery showed up.

On opening the delivery, my hot food was cold, 2 items were the wrong size and two items were missing.

As an aside, I ask for utensils, sauce packets and the like not to be included in my orders. I expect that to me missed sometimes. My order contained those items and a rediculous number of fortune cookies that were, I guess, supposed to be some sort of apology?",2021-01-30 16:33:53,743,3454,

Absolutely disrespectful and rude. My mom's dog has been getting groom there for some time now because she is too aggressive to be groomed by a regular groomer. My mom gets charged $200 every time she goes in to have her Shih Tzu shaved from nose to tail with a 10. Last time she was done they did not shave her face out well. 3 weeks later the dog's eyes are overgrown and she can't see and she has big chunks of goo in her eyes because her eyes run. Talk to the vet dr. Payne and he said if she would like the eyes shaved out he would gladly do it for $200. I told him the problem is it's a lot of money for my mom to put out she doesn't have it. And that I was hoping that since it's only been 3 weeks and had her eyes been shave properly they wouldn't be gluing the dogs eyes shut. would he be able to just shave her eyes out without charging $200. He had first told me he wasn't there when the dog was getting groomed. And that he didn't see what she look like. then he told me he was there when the dog was getting groomed ... then he told me that if this is the way that I was going to act that he did not have to give my mom a discount. So I said you're threatening to charge my mom more money because I'm disagreeing with you because I want the dogs eyes to be shaved?

Montway transported my vehicle from NJ to GA, they delivered the car with a hood full of rock chips which can cost up to $8k to fix. The driver didn't pick up nor deliver the car on time, but I overlooked that. The Monday night when he was supposed to do the delivery, I had to call him around 10 PM when I didn't hear from him, that's when he informed me he would deliver the car the next day, Tuesday. When he delivered the car I didn't see the damage at first, because, there was dirt all over the area hiding what's underneath. It wasn't until after I had the car washed I discovered the damages, which was four days later, the Saturday of the same week, because, I am very busy with work, I parked the car in the garage and didn't use it. Now, they are hiding behind the fine print on their web site telling me I should have transported the car in an enclosed container, and according to the disclaimer on their web site, they are not responsible for rock chips. They refuse to take responsibility for the damage. I am caught between Montway and HK Transport LLC, the company they hired to transport the vehicle. I am going to report this to the BBB, I am also a YouTuber, I will post a video of the damages in the first week of February 2021, including pictures and email communications.",2021-01-30 18:00:02,301,1358,

Yesterday was my birthday and my husband had placed an order to be made. He told them that I wanted a Tiramisu cake. So on the day of my birthday, my husband went to go pick it up. He brought it home and as soon as I opened the box container it came in, I could already tell they did not make the right cake. A Tiramisu cake is not made with chocolate cake or butter cream. They honestly did not know how to make a Tiramisu cake. It was just a chocolate cake with 2 layers and in the middle of the layer was butter cream and the last layer as well was butter cream. Also you don't put chocolate shavings on top of a Tiramisu cake. I know how a Tiramisu cake is suppose to taste and look like and the cake they made was no where near a Tiramisu cake. The favoring on the cake was very light where there was hardly any taste to it and in the center of the cake it was dry. They really need to step up their game and look at how to make a real Tiramisu cake. If you are looking for a Tiramisu cake, do not come to this bakery for that cake. You will be disappointed. I know I was especially for my birthday since the cake was the thing I was looking the most forward to. My husband paid $32.00 for a 8 inch cake that was not Tiramisu but just a regular (DRY) chocolate cake with butter cream and chocolate shavings on top. But thankfully I have a wonderful husband who went to Olive Garden that was 30 mins out of his way to get the Tiramisu cake that is actually made the right way. If you want a Tiramisu cake I recommend you go to Olive Garden and order a tray of Tiramisu cake. They (Olive Garden) even gave me a discount for my birthday. So thanks for saying the day Olive Garden. Anyways as far as this bakery goes I will never come back here again or recommend anyone to come here. They also tried to avoid calling my husband back after he made a complaint about the cake. Just the worst bakery I have ever gone to in my life. Big Fat Zero for me!!! Btw I will show you in the video what a Tiramisu cake should look like and how the cake this bakery made. You will see the difference. The first picture is the cake this bakery made. The second one is a slice of the Tiramisu cake that I took out of the pan it came in. But that slice of Tiramisu cake is the one from Olive Garden.",2021-01-17 14:54:39,512,2336,

I entered the store and wow wow wow all the furniture and decor just made my heart sing. I rushed over to the drapery section and after a few minutes decided which one I wanted. I looked around the shop and saw no one that could help me find the size I needed. So I saw 2 west elm
Employees chatting and asked for some help. They were quite dismissive and told me they couldn't help me but someone else could and that they would get someone. So I waited and waited and waited and eventually someone came. The person that came to help looked annoyed and I could sense it. My excited heart just died in that moment knowing that I was most likely going to be disappointed. 

I asked her to help me find the size I was looking for and she said "" that's all we have left"" . I started thinking if she was psychic - because how did she know which curtains I was talking about it considering I never even showed her which one I wanted. Maybe she was..... anyway, I showed her and said "" are you sure"" ( thinking surely they would have some in storage or something) and she said nope that's all we have. But you can order online and pick it up here. So I thought to myself ...Maybe she doesn't work

You have a few parking options when visiting here.  You can park at one of the meters out front and pay $1/ hour. You can try to find one of the limited free spots in the back of the strip mall the restaurant is in, or you can park in the parking garage in the back that says the first hour is free, but the arms at the garage were stuck in the up position anyway so I do not think they were counting time the day I was there.

This restaurant is awesome. It is clean and the employees there are very enthusiastic, courteous and friendly.  They were extremely helpful and just enhanced my lunch experience. As for their COVID precautions, the tables are socially distanced and you must wear a mask until you are seated and eating/drinking (as you do with most restaurants).  They have an assortment of bowls and grilled cheese sandwiches on the menu.  And you can get a bowl as a sandwich and a designated sandwich as a bowl.  I went with the buffalo blue grilled cheese sandwich meal. It came with tater tots, a small side of tomato soap, a chewy marshmallow bar (aka rice crispy treat), and a drink. My meal was delicious and filling. The sandwich was packed with flavor.  I highly recommend it.

For those of you that cant make it there, they are linked into most food delivery services such as Post Mates, Uber Eats and Grub Hub, so you can order delivery from them, in addition to getting your food to go or eating inside like I did. T

We didn't have a reservation, we just walked over from our hotel. We were greeted right away and were told that the wait would be 35 to 40 minutes, longer if we wanted indoor seating since there was a college football game on. The estimate was accurate. We were seated right at the 35-minute mark.

We were pretty hungry so we ordered quite a few items:
Deep fried pretzels $9
Crispy calamari $12
Slow roasted stone-fired wings $14
Fun guy $12
Crispy grouper BLT $15
Skinny spicy margarita $7
Smoked oak fashioned $10

The wings, pretzels and calamari all came out first and in a timely manner. The kids each ordered a plate of wings. One thought it was spicy and the other thought it wasn't spicy enough but ate them anyway. The apps were great, we enjoyed them.

Our poor server was overwhelmed as was the entire staff. He would disappear for long periods of time. We were told they were out of the grouper. My husband tried to order another entree, but we were worried that he would have to wait a while so we decided we would just split my pizza... Although the server let us know that the back was working on my pizza, we waited and waited and waited. It was getting late and our little one was falling asleep at the table, so my husband decided to take her back to the hotel while my son and I continued to wait for my pizza. I finally just asked our server to have it to go. We waited at least 45 minutes from the time the apps were brought to our table. We ate the pizza at the hotel. It came with roasted cremini and oyster mushrooms, roasted garlic sauce, parmesan, savory herbs, truffle oil, arugula.

It was such an experience, sampling the wine, eating pizza, and the place used to offer a lot of wine events. That's actually how I got into wine before. So, now during the COVID you can't sample the wines like before, some of the food items aren't on the menu, and basically did some changes for the pandemic. I went there on New Year's Eve night, last Thursday of 2020. I remember it was a cold night 28°, very dead downtown, right next to a hotel I believe Conrad, and as far as accessible there's no stairs so easy for someone in a wheelchair, or using crutches to enter the building. They do offer takeaway, pickup, and delivery in the downtown area if you're in the 25 mile radius. You can sample some wines whatever they have open, buy a glass, or even buy the bottle of wine. For, NYE night I had a glass of champagne Bernard Remy Carte Blanche it was very delicious, bubbly of course, and that glass was $20.00. Lastly, I had the drink called The Beautiful which is warmed, Cognac, and Grand Marnier. That drink the Sommelier came out had the drink on the side of the water to warm it up, and break it down. So, when it's warm it's not a strong drink, will definitely clear your sinus up too.

I ordered the diet cola and it was excellent. I don't think I have ever had a home made soda but it was much better tasting than any branded cola. I also new I had to get the tenderloin. They are famous for the sandwich and had three different styles breaded, grilled, and blackened. I have never had a blackened tenderloin sandwich so I decided to go with that. The service was very quick and we didn't wait very long for the food. The sandwich was in the top tier of tenderloins I have had and the bread for the bun was better than most as it was a brioch bun and very fresh. They also have all the toppings pickles, onions, lettuce, and Mayo. The sandwich also came with a choice of the side which was easy when they said tater tots. The salad was excellent too. It had a lot of bacon in it that I really enjoyed. 

Finally the pie which I know is made at a nearby bakery just for the oasis. Having bought some of the bakeries other items I knew the pie was going to be excellent.

We are slightly (ok - very) obsessed with breakfast burritos and we have tried pretty much all the breakfast burritos / sandos that Santa Barbara has to offer.  After floating around maybe 10 different spots, Super Cuca's has hands-down been our favorite and is firmly our go-to morning ritual in the Mesa.  I call to order takeout during the morning dog walk and then pickup deliciousness en route home.   I appreciate that every time I call, the person taking my order always confirms I have the right Super Cucas location (of 2) which is just good thoroughness. Also it's one of the few restaurants open before 8am which is a boon for our schedule!  (However I've noticed some of the 3rd party app ordering only starts with 8am orders - but I'd rather call directly anyway!) 

The veggie breakfast burrito is incredible -- no soggy veggies here, it's packed with fluffy scrambled eggs and crisp fresh veggies.  My second fave is their Huevos Rancheros in burrito form.  Also simply great - Chile Relleno breakfast burrito and the Cucas burrito with eggs, potatoes, cheese beans and guacamole.  Their Pico de Gallo is so fresh, I can't help ask for extra each time.  

We've also tried their vegan burritos, one which has soy pastor and another with soy beef -- it was good and fun to try something different, although I think it might have been too potato heavy for me.

We started with the bread basket which was delicious, each bread and dip we were walked through. You can tell they bake there bread fresh everyday. For the first course I had the butter milk fried shrimp with grits. The grits were cooked perfect and rival some of the best grits I have had in Tennessee. The shrimp was breaded in a really fine breadcrumb that resulted a great crunch. My gf had the tuna tar tar, she absolutely loved it. It topped with a thin crispy rice paper that contrast the raw tuna and avocado very nicely. The tuna was incredibly fresh, it solidifies the farm to table concept. For the main I had the beef short ribs. They were very very tender, I loved the addition of horseradish in the whipped potatoes it helped balance the very rich short rib. My gf got the local harvest chicken. It was amazing as well and on par with everything else we got that night. To finish dinner off we split the bread pudding. The brioche bread is so buttery and the custard with the pralines put it over the top. The drinks here are also amazing I had the winter fashioned and espresso martini both were made perfect.

I ate the burrata cheese appetizer with the prosciutto and truffle oil upgrade,  it was good but lacked flavor and I had to ask for salt and pepper.  I also had a piece of pepperoni pizza and the crust was soggy and it had a strange sweet flavor.  I also had the bread with roasted tomato and feta cheese.  It was really good, probably my favorite thing because I love feta cheese and roasted tomatoes.  I ordered the Tagliatelle to go and it really didn't wow me either.

AcZMnPPQHDbqNouRcFEAgQ,W5o8Ww3HJi0qRuAPwmEW3Q,ynAOBtqwYT9U4Jg79etHbg,3,0,2,0,"I'm really torn about how to rate and review this place.  This will become clearer in my review.

First, and most importantly, ... the pizza.  The pizza here, though a little pricey, is excellent.  The high price is reflected in the freshness and quality of ingredients and the end product.  It is clear that Dave (the owner) takes pride in his work.

Cleanliness & Hygiene ... everytime I have been here, the restaurant has appeared to my eye to be kept clean.

Service ... Dave brings his experience of working in restaurants in Boston's Italian North End here smack here to our little piece  of the Delaware Valley.  We should be so lucky as to have more chefs and pizzaiolos from that particular neighborhood migrate to our region with their training, expertise and experience.  Service is decent enough for a small, busy pizzeria.  Nothing to complain about.  Everyone is nice and they'll chat if they aren't busy running around.  Also, pre-pandemic, you could always call ahead to ask them to reserve a couple balls of dough for you, in the event that they might run-out on a particular evening.  (They often do).

Gripe ... Here's where I have trouble really reviewing this place.  Dave, deservingly, takes great pride in his restaurant and product.  He has always been adamant about discouraging takeout because he feels his pizzas are made to be eaten immediately from oven to plate.  He does not feel they travel well.  In the past, when one has requested take-out, he has gone so far as to ask how far away you might live before even accepting your order.  

That being said, I live 5 minutes' drive time from the restaurant and there are times where I just want to pick-up a couple pizzas for my family on my way home from work.  While I'm well aware of his feelings, the pizza has always been excellent and we've never had a complaint.  Over time, though, on a couple occasions, I was suddenly flat-out refused service because I wanted take-out.  I could have played the b.s. game where I'd be seated at a table, ordered our pizzas and then immediately asked for boxes but really didn't want to go through a song-and-dance just to get what I wanted.  

My family has owned restaurants in the past.  Recognizing how difficult the restaurant business can be, I always make a point of being a decent customer and showing a little bit of understanding when I may not get exactly what I want; how I want it.  But this experience with owning and working in restaurants also taught me that, as a general principle, you want to do everything within your power to not have to say, ""No,"" to a customer.  Those couple occasions where I was just flat-out refused service were just really weird, awkward moments for me and made me feel uncomfortable on the spot.  Like I didn't really know how to react or what to say in the moment (especially considering that I had been allowed to do take-out in the past), aside from just walking-out, dumbfounded.   It has made me really unsure of whether or not I ever want to give this restaurant any business ever again.  Customers should not have to be made to feel like they're doing something wrong by trying to patronize your establishment.  Business is business.  Money is money.  Word-of-mouth goes a long way in the restaurant biz.  You don't want customers to leave unhappy. 

One can't get over the irony now in how Dave's had to suspend this draconian ""No Take-Out"" policy just to keep the restaurant afloat during this pandemic.  As much as I empathize with any restaurant owner now (having seen my family live that life), and as much as I loved the pizza and the staff here, those past experiences I mentioned above really shook-up my experience of being a customer here.  I don't want to see anyone have to close in this climate.  But I'm still really torn about whether or not we will ever want to give this place our business again.",2021-01-03 00:36:57,782,3887,

The issues include: They use high pressure sales techniques that make the lowest price only good for while they are there. The sales manager promised one bag of cement per post and two in the gate posts. They did not even put in a full bag into each post and no extra in the gate posts. Scheduling the installation was also an issue. They were scheduled to come out Wednesday morning (so I cleared my work schedule to be available), but called at 8:00am to say they would not be there until just after noon. I called at 1:30 only to find that they would be here closer to 3PM, but it would be complete that day. The person arrived at 3:45 and promptly told me that they would be dropping off the materials and coming back the following day (which was supposed to be the first day of my vacation). The person unloads the materials and puts in 3 posts, which each had less than a bag of cement. They actually only dropped off 15 bags of cement for 24 posts. The next day I approached the gentleman about the lack of concrete in the post holes and he would not even discuss it and blew up at me yelling about the cement. This was a horrible experience and should not happen to anyone paying almost $4500 for a small fence. I tried resolving this issue with Kyle the sales person and Rich the office manager, but neither of them were concerned with addressing the issue. I was not aware of this prior, but they did explain that they outsource all of the installations and that I could deal with the workers boss. This was ridiculous as I did not contract with the other company. I spoke with someone at the other company and he said that he would be here on Monday to address any issues, but never showed up. Since I could not speak to the person installing the fence civilly I decided to remove myself from that moment and just let him finish. After the work was completed, I tested each post by tapping the base of it with a stick and most of them had air pockets (which really concerns me for the longevity of the fence) in the dirt and minimal cement to be found. One of the gates also has damage as well as one of the pickets. I reached out to the teams (fence outlet manager and the subcontractor) today, but not to my surprise, no one responded.

If a maintenance repair needed to happen, I would call the office, and within 48 hours someone would be sent over to fix the problem. I spent nearly two years in one of their properties in Isla Vista, and upon moving in the unit was  a little outdated, but otherwise in pristine condition (clean, great plumbing, all appliances working, etc.). 

Deedy was the property manager and she was professional, friendly, and upfront about inspections, announcements involving the complex (e.g., people needing to move their bikes of the pathways), and any other property related occurrences. While workers were redoing the roof, they happened to drill a few tiny holes in my ceiling. I emailed her some images and explained what happened, and she informed me that I would not be charged, which I really appreciated! 

I never experienced any problems with their online portal in regards to paying rent and they're very straightforward about what is owed and why. 

Before moving out, I mentioned at their office that I was disappointed they didn't have other locations out of state, because I GENUINELY enjoyed renting through the company. Unfortunately, since I've moved, I haven't had as great of an experience with my current property management group, and I definitely miss Meridian!

I was not disappointed and we all had such a great time at Top Golf. Here is my review of the Mount Laurel location. 

Parking: we thought that by coming during the early afternoon on a Saturday that there would not be as many people, especially during the winter. Boy was I wrong. As soon as I made the turn into the parking lot, I saw that it was particularly busy. However, there is ample parking to accommodate all of the guests and more as there were plenty of spots available. 

Service: 4/5 - The people at the front desk were super friendly and very accommodating. Initially, I was nervous that I would not be able to get 2 bays right next to each other, however they saw my reservation and made sure that I got 2 bays next to each other so that my party did not have to separated. I really really appreciated that as it took some stress off my mind and let me fully enjoy the birthday celebration. The staff was very helpful in getting us set up to play and brought us our food very quickly. I was overall impressed at how smoothly things were running despite it being a busy Saturday. 

The Experience: I think I can speak for everyone when I say we had such a good time. I think there is something for everyone at Top Golf. If you do not like to golf, no worries as the venue is also a sports bar with great drinks and TV in each bay. Each bay was well heated so we did not even really feel the cold winter weather. The location was very clean and all of the equipment was clean and ready to use. I had a friend who golfs with his left hand and they gave him proper lefty friendly clubs immediately. 

In total, we stayed 3 hours. We laughed, we ate good food, and played golf. We had shared appetizers and loved the Mac and cheese bites and the pizza. The only downside is that Top Golf starts to become very expensive so I would keep that in mind when you go. The cost is the only reason why I give this place a 4/5 stars.  I also recommend making a reservation for a bay before you go so that you do not have to wait too long to start playing. Legit golfers might enjoy the driving range because of the cost, but if you're looking for a place to celebrate with golf, food, and sports, then this is your spot.",2021-01-26 21:04:38,501,2379,
aHhnhZqINVK4uin-uun9Sg,VhyMPBkWc1mcFpuu2CAAKw,w55VlTgAoRXPnqFte3j9ew,4,8,4,7,"So...I'm really regretful that I am writing this review after my second visit to Revolution Taco, because compared to my first meal there, this one was a relatively subpar experience. However, as I am fully aware that the extent of my disappointment was largely thr result of the mistakes I made in my approach to the business of eating the second meal, I am still rating Revolution Taco 4 stars overall.
So...the first, much better eating experience, was an order of vegetarian tacos. In the good old days when it was still safe to have reckless dine-in experiences at restaurants, I stopped in one day with two friends for lunch, and we each got our own order of tacos. I'm pretty sure I had gotten the mushroom tacos, and one of the friends got an order of  the BBQ cauliflower, so we were able to mix and match (not an option within a single order). I distinctly remember bright, exciting flavors, and two tacos were quite adequate for me as a lunch. I can't recall if I had any sauces on the side, but it's likely. Overall, for the quality, the quick service, and portion size, excellent prices too. So a really great first experience. 
The second experience, alas, not as wonderful as the first - that was the takeout on a Friday night that led to this review. But a number of reasons for the lesser experience, most of which were less shortcomings of the meal than of my own sequence of decisions:
1. I got a burrito. Clearly, if ""Taco"" is in the name, you figure that will be the superior option of the two, and in this case you would be correct. I really prefer burritos to tacos though, so I was hoping the  burrito would be as good as the tacos I remembered- not so much.
2. I didn't get any sauces on the side. Big mistake. My burrito selection, smoked mushroom, was filled with a lot of rice, chunks of smoked portobello mushroom, some beans, a tiny bit of crema and a tinier bit of tomato. So it ended up being REALLY dry. I hate getting the little to-go containers of sauce, but really, that would have made for a much better eating experience here.
3. In spite of realizing after a few bites in the extent of mistakes 1 and 2, I made no attempt to try for any of a range of options to improve the meal - say, to slice up one of the tomatoes i had at home to go with half the burrito- and instead, like a mindless glutton, I sat and ate the entire burrito in one sitting.
The dryness of the burrito was its own issue, and the smokiness of the mushrooms didn't really help with that. On the other hand, my partner got the chickpea veggie burger burrito and he was very happy with that, in spite of there also being a dry quality to his burrito too (no sauce for him either). 
So, lessons learned:
1. Don't pass on the sauces!
2. Chickpea veggie burrito instead of smoked mushroom.
3. Maybe skip burrito altogether and just get the excellent tacos.",2021-01-17 17:03:41,622,2861,

From the beginning I had a very rough start with this complex nothing is wrong with the apartments itself it's the way they manage and run things.
When I got approved for the apartment they said I will not have to put any deposit and then the next day they wanted a full months rent after I was told that I dint have to put anything down. (Was told that there was a miscommunication witch it wasn't) the. After me returning the apartment back to the complex I get a statement where I dint give them a spare key for the mailbox and the standard key for the apartment when I was never given a spare. Also they wanted to charge me for repainting the apartment when they was no damage done to the paint. And then I called about it they said it was an error? How do you charge someone for extra things on error.
The fun part was not receiving my deposit 6 months after I returned the apartment. 
There was another situation. My car got stolen from this complex I asked for the video camera on the time that my car was stolen and I was told that the manager dint have access to the cameras and I asked for 3 months and after that they finally were able to get their information to get to the cameras but weren't able to do anything cause everything gets deleted 30 days after it was recorded and that is with poor camera placements and lack of them. There is a total of maybe 5 cameras for a complex this big. I had nothing to use to find the person that stole my car and the place that I lived at couldn't even give me a video to try to get my property back. There is a homeless issue with them going into the property and asking for money and even sleeping on the balcony's of peoples apartment.

I ordered the lunch special flounder with ginger scallion sauce, with fried rice and hot & sour soup, and an order of shumai (wasabi pork, crispy). 
I've never had crispy shumai and I figured they'd be pan fried like a dumpling would be. Instead, they were battered and deep fried. I gave them a try; the deep fried part wasn't awful but they left a weird taste in my mouth, and didn't notice any wasabi flavor. I tried one and a half, and threw the rest out. 
The soup smelled great but was so thickened that it was extremely unappealingly gloppy. If you've ever seen the slime a hagfish produces, that's pretty much what it was like. I tried one spoonful and had to throw the rest out. It tasted great, but I couldn't overcome the consistency.
The fried rice that came with the lunch special was just rice and egg- no issue with that, and it tasted fine but bland. Ginger scallion 'sauce' was wokked ginger and scallion, which worked better with the fish than if it was a saucy sauce. Fish looked perfect and there was plenty of thin, quick-cooked pieces. Overall, the dish was very good! 
Again, I really want to like this place but the dishes are too inconsistent and when I end up throwing away most of the order (especially when I hoped to get at least two meals out of it), it doesn't make sense to keep trying the place.",2021-01-22 18:56:42,318,1450,
PsSrIt2thr7jFldBHDtl_g,U93MeObfT1H1pFDujYYyGg,8SlHynYA-QN3UYRpKvNDgA,2,1,0,0,"Never in my life have I been treated so rudely  at a restaurant. Our most recent visit may have been our last. Every New Year's Eve my wife and I go to BJs for dinner and drinks. This past New Year's Eve we continued the tradition.  Once  seated, our server Samantha informed us that the kitchen was running 45 minutes behind, to which was fine because we were in no particular rush. We ordered drinks and an appetizer to hold us over while we waited for our entrees. Two minutes later we decided that we should probably order our entrees due to the kitchen being behind. A minute later our server came back by and we said we would like to order since the wait was so long. She took our order and returned a couple minutes later with our appetizer. While in the middle of enjoying our pot stickers (of which we had two-and-a-half left to eat) a our  entrees cam out. This was 8 to 10 minutes after getting our appetizer. While this wasn't necessarily a big problem, it was a little frustrating considering we were told the kitchen was running 45 minutes behind which prompted our decision to order our entrees.  Samantha came out shortly after and said that she was so sorry and that our table was the first to receive entrees in under 30 minutes. I informed her that it was frustrating because we are now having to switch back and forth between our appetizer and entrees. She offered to put the food under the warmer in the kitchen and bring it out once we were done with the pot stickers. I told her I didn't want that because we had ordered steak and that would likely cook the steak beyond the temperature we wanted. She said that she would send the manager over to address our concerns. The assistant manager Nicholas came over and I explained the situation, to which he said ""I'm sorry. The problem is that we have a lot of take out orders which put the kitchen behind."" To which I responded, I understand how that could happen, but I also understand that management's job, is to manage the expectations of guest and ensure the restaurant is ran efficiently and that perhaps if he, or another manager communicated with servers that the kitchen was no longer behind, guests would not make a decision to order their food early based on the misinformation that their meals would take about 45 minutes to be prepared. Nicholas proceeded to escalate the situation by raising his voice at me and saying ""DONT TELL ME HOW TO DO MY JOB! I took care of your pot stickers, what more do you want?"" I said to him that I am not looking for anything else and I just wanted to bring to your attention the situation and communicate our expectations as a guest. He then went on to say ""We have 60+ take out orders to prepare and that's our moneymaker, so that's where I need to direct my attention."" I then replied ""so what you are implying in that statement is that your dine-in guest are not as important as your take-out patrons"". He then again raised his voice and said that he didn't say that...to which I replied ""I didn't say you said that, I said you implied it."" I further said that I would be taking this up with the general manager and corporate because ""...your treatment of us is highly unprofessional and I don't think you should be in management conducting yourself this way."" He then said ""I'm over here trying to make it better and you are attacking me. I am about to get married, and have a baby on the way, and you are attacking me and threatening me in this global pandemic we have going on."" I am not entirely sure what his personal situation has to do with us and why he informed us that he is about to get married and have a child. I said to Nicholas ""I am not sure what that has to do with this situation and asked who the general manager was."" He informed me it was a gentlemen named Yoo, and I said I would contact Yoo tomorrow. He then raised his voice at me a final time and said ""YOU KNOW WHAT? DONT EVER COME BACK TO THIS RESTURANT. YOU ARE NO LONGER WELCOME HERE!"" and he walked away. With my wife's and my jaw basically on the floor because of that treatment, I saw Yoo walk across the front of the restaurant. I asked Samantha to send him over. I explained the whole situation to him, to which he apologized and said that Nicholas should not have acted like that. I said to Yoo that ""we frequently visit this restaurant, and that I am not sure that we will come back based on Nicholas' behavior. Yoo took care of our meal that evening, which was nice. Our plans that night included having some friends to join us at BJs for drinks, but we were no longer enjoying ourselves in the restaurant. We ended up leaving with our meals unfinished as a result of losing our appetite and went to the restaurant next door to meet our friends for drinks and appetizers. The service and treatment at that restaurant, from the GM down, far exceeds the treatment we received at BJs. 
I hope that Nicholas' behavior gets addressed and this doesn't happen to another guest.",2021-01-02 20:05:27,1031,4977,

Scrambling to find somewhere to go and things to do while we were there (and that were still open) was definitely a large task. Once I settled on the location, I hit up my old friend, Yelp for some assistance. Then I asked my aunt who used to live in nearby Belle Aire for many years where she would recommend. The stars aligned with The Black Pearl.

I called and got a reservation a couple days out and planned around it. While we were still driving down after the nuptials, the Black Pearl called since they had a cancellation. The opening was right as we were due to arrive. I confirmed and smacked Waze around to get me to The Black Pearl!

First of all, they had just finished an interior remodel from what the staff told us so if it's been a while, you might like it more or less than last time. Outside? Not so much. It's pretty unassuming from the exterior and it's easy to overlook if you're not familiar with the location. We literally had to ask some people to move away from smoking in front of the door. Their response? Oh, there's a restaurant there? It just looks a little dated - but familiar to return guests so.... Back to the inside. Very clean and crisply elegant. It wasn't overly fancy, but it was visually obvious that, for most of us, it isn't your ""it's another Wednesday family meal"" location. Still, with us being in her wedding dress and me in my suit and tie, we were a little overdressed compared to most of the other diners.

The waiter sat us promptly and was very friendly throughout our dining experience. I had passed along that it was our wedding date when I made the original reservations and the whole staff made sure to mention their congratulations, check in on us, and just make everything was extra special for us both. We even had another couple send over two glasses of champagne and their congratulations.

Everything we ordered was delicious and amazing. Please check out my pics to see how appealing everything looked too.I will say that I was a little worried at first when they brought out a tiny appetizer (called an AMUSE BOUCHE) - JAMON SERRANO + COMPRESSED MELON. I'll admit that I was already contemplating a drive-thru on the way to the hotel. Well, it was deliciously small. I needn't have worried though since the meal items that followed were plentiful and equally amazing.

From the Starters, we got the ESCARGOT. It was an amazingly delicate puff pastry with a creamy escargot interior. We each had different salads but they were very good, although I think the Black Pearl Salad is the better one of the two. The Preserved Lemon Sorbet was a perfect palate cleanser and I loved the extra crunch.

For our entrees, I had the HEREFORD FILET MIGNON and she had the NEW ZEALAND RACK OF LAMB. Both were outstanding but, once again, I think the steak won the day. It was just seared to medium-rare perfection. I'm not much of a lamb person, but her dish was very flavorful.

What can I tell you? This place absolutely started us off on the right path to a great honeymoon and we'll always have fond memories of the Pearl. If you're looking for somewhere similar, make this a bookmark to hit up one day!",2021-01-26 20:46:52,673,3281,

I was most concerned with pneumonia since he had recently developed a cough.  First, I called ahead to let them know I was bringing him in and the woman over the phone told me I could check him in and leave him in the car.  I arrived and checked him in and then when called to register another woman told me I could not do it for him.  Ok, no problem so I went to get him. We were registered and then told to go back into the car and wait our turn.  We waited about 45-60 mins, no biggie I understand how busy facilities are right now.  I was not allowed in so I made sure to tell my husband to ask for a chest xray.  He waited almost another 60 mins for a Dr to come in to see him.  While waiting he heard the same Dr who saw him say something along the lines of he didn't want to see any more patients that day- it was about 11am.  He then went into my husbands room, did his assessment and said his lungs sounded good and he would do a chest xray ""to make your wife happy"".  My husband also proceeded to tell me how miserable and rude the xray technician was.  I understand, this is a pandemic and you're exposed everyday by covid positive patients but you don't know how bad these patients feel and how much your attitude is reflected.  I myself am a healthcare worker and would never think to be rude or miserable in front of my patients, no matter what kind of day it is. The Dr then looked at his chest xray in front of him and said it looked good.  We were sent home with a ""you just have to let it runs its course, there is nothing we can give you"".  Although, I felt relief I felt there was still something going on.  We got a call that same night that the radiologist read the chest xray and it showed ""the beginnings of pneumonia"".  We were prescribed an antibiotic and started that night. We actually ended up getting a telemed visit with his PCP and was placed on a different antibiotic and more meds.  The point of my review is, although on paper he looked good have some more compassion, Dr try your best to make sure nothing is wrong, especially during these times of covid. Instead, he was very dismissive and things could have taken a huge turn for the worst if he never did that chest xray.  I am so happy that he did it ""just to make me happy"".  Would not recommend this patient first again, maybe if you had a bump or scrape but nothing serious.",2021-01-10 01:12:16,546,2560,

I have been wanting to go here because i love barracuda on tchoup and the vibe seemed similar. We pre ordered online we got 2 fish tacos, grilled queso, and a Barbacoa quesadilla (which isn't a quesadilla but I'll get to that in a sec) 

The fish tacos are very small which a huge piece of beer battered fish don't get me wrong they were awesome, but the tortilla was way too small for that big of a piece of fish and it was $4. I do love how they used the blue corn tortillas it's a very cool take. 

The quesadilla is open faced so it's more like a pizza, what sucks about this is if you take it to-go or are eating outside when it's cooler, the cheese cools much faster and it's not gooey like you would normally expect. It had a great flavor but def not as good as a quesadilla that has two sides to it. And you def miss out on the cheese stretch.

Lastly the grilled queso--ehhh I wish they had chips and queso!!!  A lot of places serve both to satisfy both sets of customers. Just to emphasize it's like what people eat when they are on a keto diet just fried cheese, it's okay with the salsa verde but if you are someone that doesn't like super salty things do not get it.  

Margs and palomas are good! I would love to go back for happy hour to try the ribs, more tacos, some of their cocktails and chill outside.  

Like I said the food is good but not super impressive (besides the fish tacos) 

Maybe pair some suggestions for the top of the quesadilla (guac or beans maybe?)  or rename it? I know a lot of ppl would just see ""quesadilla"" and not read the description and be disappointed -which is on them but when people recognize a food they have a certain idea of it... 

Also maybe some toppings for the grilled queso  like ""make it loaded! Add beans, pico, and crema for 2.99) 

An offering of a mezcal tasting or even a flight  (when things open back up)  could also be super cool. They have super affordable pours which is great ! 

this review is not  to be reflective of staff they were nice and brought our order out COVID proof and all! 

Tl:dr -stick to the fish tacos and margs and you'll  be very satisfied! I would give more of a 3.5 if I could!!",2021-01-22 02:18:51,490,2235,

I was pleasantly surprised with the precautions they are taking for COVID-19 and the dining experience was great. The service was wonderful and the food came out very quickly. I ordered a grilled cheese that came with soup and I also had a cocktail.

The menu has a wide righty of options in something that will satisfy many different taste buds. The drink menu also has some good unique concoctions. 

The cocktail I had was the bees elbows knees & toes. It was light, refreshing, and not too sweet. It wasn't very busy tasting either so if you don't like your drinks to taste very strong this one is for you. 

The soup was delicious and had a little bit of a spicy kick to it which I enjoyed. It had a great combination of flavors in it and complemented The grilled cheese quite well. I'm always a sucker for a good Brie grilled cheese as they are so much better than a traditional grilled cheese. The only thing I would add is that over the time t me the grilled cheese started to get soggy so I would recommend eating it more quickly than slowly. Anyways, it was still great and crispy on the outside which I liked. I would also like to add that the beet chips that came with this dish were delicious. I truly appreciated how all three of these items on this dish complemented one another so beautifully. 

I would return to this restaurant in the future as the service was good, the drink was good, and the food was good. When all three of the above are good then you can't go wrong and should go back.",2021-01-28 21:45:31,330,1625,

I had my first date with my (now) husband here back in April 2015 and he introduced me to it. I loved the doggo photos everywhere! 

We would come back approximately on our anniversary every year for drinks and occasionally brought some trusted friends in for a burger. Love the wide beer selection.

He held my surprise birthday/engagement party here in January 2020. (Yes he made me wait five years.)  We had drinks and they held a cake for us in the fridge and sliced it up when we were ready. I love that the third floor is just open space to hang out for that.

We came to Good Dog for lunch after getting mani/pedis on our elopement day in July 2020 as they had just reopened outdoor dining. I had a lovely beet salad and some kind of lemonade cocktail. It was hot that day, but we had to make sure Good Dog was a part of it!

Now, on the one year anniversary of our engagement, we did takeout from Good Dog because I received a birthday treat reward from their rewards program - $20 off?! Woah. Best deal ever.

I ordered the brisket grilled cheese and hubby (I can say that now, aww) ordered the fried grouper po' boy. We also got 2 Something Hot cocktails to-go.

Those cocktails will warm you upppp. If it snows again, I plan to get another round and walk in the snow with it. Vibe.

The brisket grilled cheese was also quite comforting after a ridiculously long unnecessary Friday of remote working. I would say the brisket to cheese ratio was probably 3:1 so in my book I don't think it qualified as a grilled cheese but NO MATTER. It was perfect, whatever it was. That aioli (I think) that came with it was also divine. I would like a whole bottle please.

Bae loved his po' boy so much he finished it before I could take a picture. That sandwich was as big as my arm. It looked good from the few glimpses I caught of it before it was gone.

And shoe string type fries are always my fave. Nice touch.

Overall, always 5 stars and thanks for being part of literally every big moment in our relationship! 

I wish I had a dog to submit for the next photo contest, but alas - I am a cat lady. Maybe I'll get a picture of my brudder Champ in there some day.

ALSO: We aren't the type to do indoor or outdoor dining right now, but I did appreciate that Good Dog didn't create an ""indoor"" 3-sided structure outdoors. Their outdoor dining has plenty of airflow and is an open space with a roof to protect you from the elements. So if you're up for it, it seemed as safe as outdoor dining can get right now!

 Dr Wojtyna chairside manner needs work! Lots of it! That was the least of the problems I encountered in this office. I had to go in several times because my temporary implant kept falling out and what was supposed to be a two week wait for the permanent implant turned into 2 months. When I went in to get my permanent implant, the assistant tried to pull the wrong tooth. When I told her she was pulling on the wrong one, she argued with me! The last assistant who put in the notes, put in the wrong number tooth to extract and she was going to believe the note over the patient's word. I had to return after my permanent implant because it also fell out. The last straw for me was when I went in for my annual cleaning and was told by the front desk attendant that I HAD to have a deep cleaning and the regular cleaning wasn't an option. WHAT?!!! I understand a recommendation for what's best for the patient but to tell me I HAD to do this is unprofessional, like the other events I encountered in the office. On my way out, I had decided this was the last time I would be using this office for my dental needs. I asked to speak to a manger and was told she's not available and they would pass the message along. I NEVER received a call back. 

Was also told on my last visit I needed two cavities filled. I changed to a private practice where I immediately noticed a huge change in customer service and the dentist only found 1 cavity and said the rest of my teeth looked fine.

We were craving traditional Italian food and found Marra's on a ""Best of Philly"" list for chicken parm. Ordered delivery on a Friday night, and it was PHENOMENAL. Seriously. 

HUGE menu. Delivery was on time. Prices were great (better than a lot of comparable places). And exactly what we wanted: old school Italian. Yum. 

Fried Mozzarella: 5. OK, this was one of the reasons we ordered from Marra's - a lotta these joints don't have mozz sticks. Maybe not the MOST Italian dish ever, but we crave them. Marra's were GREAT - crispy, but soft & gooey in the middle. Yum. There was a fight over the last one (the daughter got it, of course). 

Caesar Salad: 4. Probably my least favorite of what we ordered (at least, what I got to taste!). Dressing was yummy, salad was... romaine & croutons, nothing too special. Still, hit the spot. 

Garlic Bread: 4. Good hot! Pretty tough the next day - but great flavor. (Now that we know the entrees come with free bread, we'll probably skip ordering this!) 

""Personal"" Sausage Pizza: 5. Stepdaughter was thrilled. Ate half Friday night; the other half Saturday for lunch. We didn't get a bite. 

Baked Ziti: 5. This was MY dish. Mine. All mine. I've had 3 dinners out of it so far (and a few snacky bites), and there's still a little left. And it is GOOD. Yes, there's ricotta baked in. It's yummy. Perfect amount of cheese and sauce, pasta is great. Really excellent!

ryQTEmPIHlV1HnwDEtLnlg,XuhTVQngwNMIdemX24kR1w,XfljJZE0XYjWyBbIDwRSRw,1,5,0,1,"*Lengthy - Worth the read before ordering countertops*
We ordered our new quartz kitchen countertops during Colonial Marble and Granite's (CMG) annual winter sale. We began the ordering process at the beginning of December 2020. Right out of the gate our experience was less than desirable. We were dealing with the Harrisburg location and they were next to impossible to reach on the phone and were very slow to respond to email communication. After trying to obtain estimates for different styles of quartz counters at the Harrisburg location, I tried calling the Delaware location. It was again difficult to reach anyone on the phone but after a few tries I was able to talk to someone. When I said I was interested in several different quartz countertops and wanted to know the price points of each style, both the Harrisburg location and Delaware location acted as if I was asking too much and that it was a major inconvenience to have to share the price point of each countertop style. My mother has quartz countertops in her home so I ended up choosing her style of countertop and forgoing the apparent ""annoyance"" of exploring other options.
We ended up making the trip to the CMG location in Harrisburg the next day to try to deal with someone in person. By this point, we had already made our decision on countertop style (the same as my mother's counters) so they were more than happy to process our purchase with little to no work on their end. We scheduled our appointment to have our countertops measured and scheduled our appointment for installation. Had we not made the trip to the showroom, I am very confident that we would have not been able to obtain sufficient service prior to the sale ending. It was clear that they were overwhelmed and under staffed. 
Our measurement appointment came and went smoothly. I wish the technician on-site would have been a little more engaged and helpful in recommending which size corners to select and what height backsplash to choose, but I understand that is all personal preference. The person on-site for measurement was clearly not a designer and not interested in helping to recommend what would look nice. Our kitchen sink was on-site for the measurement appointment and the technician measured both the actual sink as well as the template. He even took the paper template with him to ensure the measurements were correct. When they are finished taking all of the measurements, there is a program on their iPad that shows a model of your countertops. I asked the technician if he was able to tell us the final square footage of our countertops and he told me that they no longer have those permissions and I will have to wait for someone in the offices to share that final number with me. 
At no point between the measurement appointment and the time the countertops were scheduled to be installed did anyone from CMG reach out to me in order to let us know the final square footage of our countertops. When we were quoted for the counters at the Harrisburg location, we made a very rough estimate of our square footage so it was very hard for me to believe that we could have possibly been spot on. 
Install day came and two men show up with our countertops. We make the second half of the payment for the countertops. At this point we still have not been told the final square footage. The installer only had the original receipt for the estimate. He had no idea what our final measurement was. They asked my husband to help them carry in the countertops because they were not able to do it on their own. The first piece of countertop they brought in had our sink cut out and one of the installers noticed that the hole for the sink was cut too long in one direction and too short in the other direction. He then looked at me and told me that he can ""make it work"" if I'd like. I obviously said that I would not accept the countertop and that it had to be redone. He made several calls to the office in King of Prussia (KOP) and had difficulty reaching anyone on the phone (as I did each time I tried to call anyone at CMG). He finally got a hold of someone and told them that the countertop was cut incorrectly. This was a Friday morning and the office told him they could have our countertops remade and ready for install on the following Tuesday. Meanwhile, we had 5 days (Friday-Tuesday) to figure out how we were going to live with our kitchen. We told CMG that we felt we deserved some kind of compensation for the inconvenience and the woman in the phone from the KOP location told the installer that she would call us to work something out. We waited several hours with no phone call so we called the KOP location ourselves. We explained our situation to the first woman on the phone and she said she would check to see if the woman we spoke with was at her desk. She walked away from the phone to check, came back, said ""one moment please"", transferred us to her phone, and we got her voicemail. (more to the story)",2021-01-19 15:12:29,976,4989,

Told groomer my dog has a chronic right ear infection that is flaring up now. After waiting seven hours for my dogs I finally texted and was told one needed maybe another hour and was very matted today...weird since she was way worse last time and her legs were brushed out three days ago but...ok.  An hour went by, Saturday about 5:00 and no word so my daughter and I got in the car to just go there.  Through the window we could see our dog on the grooming table (other dog in a cage - at least three of her nails clipped to the point of bleeding) and three people working on her frantically (also odd no one waved me in and they all kept looking out the window), adult daughter and I watched one of the three be especially rough with our dog...not just for a second but maybe five non stop minutes on her sensitive/infected ear, at which point we jumped out of the car and went in. I said I'd take her now in whatever condition she was in. 
I was told she was brushed for about six hours, two people. That sounds cruel to me especially after watching how rough she was treated.  
I have reached out to the owner with no response, and wish I had been given an option to trim dog down rather than torture her all day...there for eight hours.  For two dogs I was charged $325.  (Charged $170 first visit and dogs' coats more matted...no call about up charge or options to groom less/cut or shave shorter.)

Was last in just before the new year, and after our order was completely wrong (including putting my wife's ""bowl"" on bread and putting a pile of mayo on my ""NO MAYO"" sandwich) the lady at the counter apologized and gave me a card for a free order on my next visit.

Went in two days ago to ""try again"" and when I showed the guy who referred himself as the ""new manager, for about two weeks"" my card he literally tossed it back to me and said ""it expired in september"". I told him I'd only just been given it in november, and could even show the transaction, he literally said ""it's not my problem"".

I just said ""fine"" and ordered my food (there was a snowstorm coming and I was planning for the next day). I ordered my wife a cheesesteak bowl with ""extra meat"" and an italian sub for myself, also with ""extra meat"". When I saw her bowl I simply said ""really? That's ""extra meat""? It wasn't even 1/3 full. Then as I watched my sandwich be made and when the (very nice) guy who made it put just 4 slices of pepperoni on my large sandwich I asked if that was ""extra meat"". Before he could answer the ""new manager"" jumped in and said ""don't add more, that's enough"". Literally 4 slices of pepperoni?

In the end I paid over $25 for a pathetic sandwich and a bowl that didn't even fill up my wife and I for dinner, when I thought we'd have leftovers for lunch the next day. Whomever hired this new manager might want to think twice. He easily could have just said ""I'm sorry they gave you an expired card, but no worries I'll honor it"", and/or ""be sure to give them extra meat, since they're paying for it"". Instead he just seemed annoyed the store was empty. Maybe it was empty because of his awful customer service?

The entire menu at Casablanca is filled with what you'd find at a typical restaurant in Havana. I recognized many dishes that I've dined on and they were all delicious, so it was hard for me to make a decision. During my first visit I bellied up to the world-famous Sandwich Cubano (roasted pork, ham, pickles, Swiss cheese and mustard on a Cuban style bread). Man, I tell you, it was SPOT ON. Reminded me of my trip years ago when I had my first one. The meat was roasted to perfection, delivered a dynamite of flavor and was too damn good to stop eating! If you try one thing here, this is it!

On another occasion I was served the Ropa Vieja (shredded beef in Cuban Creole sauce with onions and peppers. Served with white rice, black beans and sweet ripe plantains (maduros)). This also happens to be Cuba's national dish! Again, each bite took me back to Havana. Sweet, delicate and tender beef paired with fresh cooked rice and beans. The taste was outstanding. Boise lacks so many authentic cuisine but Casablanca reminds me that true food is there if you seek it. 

On another note, I absolutely loved our waiter both times. He was very kindhearted and humorous, took time to inform us of what each dish consisted of, which was super helpful for my very Americanized husband (nothing wrong with that - he just doesn't have the palate for authentic food like I do!). 

In a heartbeat, I recommend this to anyone who is tired of over-sweetened, sodium packed eateries that boast but fail to deliver genuine cuisine. Also, if you've never had Cuban food you are missing out on so much!!! And it's here, in little Boise so HEAD OVER AND SUPPORT THIS LOCAL BUSINESS that I love so dearly!",2021-01-14 05:30:08,401,1883,

The concept is Indian fusion mixed with Mexican food and it sounded absolutely delicious. They offer a variety of wraps, burritos, bowls, and even poutine with classic Indian flavors and dishes. 

My partner and I each ordered the super bowl which was such a great deal at only $15 you could choose 3 proteins and a base, and we were completely stuffed.  I got the butter chicken with chickpeas (chana) and saag paneer, topped with yogurt and the medium chutney.  My partner got the chicken tikka masala with beans (rajma) and saag paneer and yogurt as well, but with the hot chutney. The chutneys were nice and spicy and really added a great flavor to our bowls (the medium one was more herby in flavor, the hot was more peppery).  We tried each individually before mixing it all together, and each component was really delicious except for maybe the saag paneer, we weren't too crazy about as the cheese curds were very small. Overall, super pleased though with them! 

Our poutine was alright- ours unfortunately came without the cheese it was supposed to be topped with? We ordered a small kids' size just to try it because we were really intrigued, and we topped it with chorizo tikka, jalapeños, katchumber (cucumber, tomatoes, onions) and pickled onions. The fries were actually really great, nice and crispy and delicious but overall it kind of was nothing special, just fries topped with things. We should have in hindsight ordered a more curry based meat topping to make it closer to poutine. 

I would definitely recommend them as a quick bite / takeout place, I could see this being a great stop for a hearty lunch for anyone and it for sure gets huge bonus points for uniqueness!",2021-01-24 23:20:00,353,1786,

There are apparently no good bagel places in West Chester so off to Bryn Mawr I went.  You guys have like 4 good options in a square mile radius!

Spread serves up ""Montreal-style"" bagels which as far as I know usually means three things: 1) boiled in honey-water before baking, so they're slightly sweeter on the outside than NY-style, 2) they tend to have a larger hole, which can make them tedious for sandwich-building, and 3) they are baked in wood-fired ovens.  I can only confirm Spread does #3, but it's a great element to their bagels.  As far as the holes, I'd say they are about the same as NY-style here.

I tried a Plain, an Everything, and a Chocolate Chip.  The chocolate chip was really nice - the base seemed to be darker than I'm used to so I wonder if they use a bit of wheat flour or perhaps some of the chocolate melts into the dough.  Either way, it was good!  They were out when I visited the second time but I'll definitely get another in the future.

My favorite bagel here has actually been the Plain.  It's so soft with a nice chew and I will quickly put away a whole one even without toasting it or adding any toppings. I had to get extras on my last visit because one inventively doesn't last the car ride home.

I also enjoy the aesthetic inside the store.  Love the letter flip-board that is reminiscent of a train station.  Is it weird that I want one of those in my house now? 

Service was good both times I went.  The first time the cashier addressed me by name as I was swiping my card which I thought was a nice touch.

Next time I'm there I'd like to try some of their sandwiches, spreads, or bagel pizzas!",2021-01-02 21:35:23,374,1722,

This review is wrong and does not accurately rate the restaurant. She gave it a one star cause we'd brought our dog and the outside patio was full except for a few tables that were reserved. She countered this by saying we've been coming here for a long time as if it gave us higher authority. When the part-time employee did her job and said no she got mad and left. She left a 1 star review as a way to tarnish this place so I thought that I could use a 5 star to counteract it and it balances it out. Thus here are the reasons Señor Tequila is a great restaurant.
     The food here is always quality, don't let anybody tell you it's not. It's always been consistently great and I can only think of one time that the food wasn't good but considering the amount of times we've been there it's not really a problem. The staff are so nice and helpful. It's obvious that there are new employees coming in so I always give them the benefit that they're new and aren't going to be perfect at first. Even when they do mess up they so apologetic and nice. There are also dogs allowed on the outside patio, just make sure to check for availability ahead of time.

I had booked my hotel online through hotels.com whom I use on the regular. When I arrived to the hotel to check in there was no one at the front desk. I waited for 10 minutes. No one came. I cleared my throat. I leaned around the counter and no one was there. I said ""excuse me"" at two different times but to no avail. Finally another hotel guest walked through the front door and noticed just by walking by that no one was at the front desk and I was clearly waiting and she said ""ill take a look for them"" and a few moments later came back saying she ""found someone who works there."" When the employee arrived back behind the check in desk she did not apologize or anything just said ""Checking in?"" to which I gave her my information and was able to get my room key and parking pass. I brought my luggage upstairs and found the room very close to the elevators and saw and heard children running through the hall as I opened my door. Children will be children, not a big deal but it was after 9pm at this point that I was arriving to my room after 8 hours of travel. I was looking forward to just relaxing and a good nights sleep. Well upon entering I noticed right away that there were 3 light bulbs out on 2 different light fixtures... Not the end of the world but not great to find either. I got situated and jump onto the bed, like belly first and I literally yelped in pain as it felt like I had bruised my pelvic bones. I sat up and realized the bed was the HARDEST bed I have ever felt in my life... After taking a couple videos to show how hard the bed was I then laid down on it to relax and as I laid there looking around the room I noticed that there were cords... hanging out of the wall... A hole in the wall (drywall) with loose wires completely hanging out of it and spots /dents on the paint where something was clearly hung ""before"" and no longer there. At this point I am not thrilled with this room AT ALL as the wires seemed to be a huge safety hazard in addition to light bulbs being out and a rock hard bed. I decide I will call the front desk and ask if they were aware of the loose/exposed wires hanging out the wall and ripped off paint area next to it. As I went to call the front desk I realize that the phone (which is VERY dated) is flashing as if it has a voicemail. Had this room even been inspected before sending a customer to stay here? This is a large hotel and it was a week night, surely there were other rooms that I could have been put in that would have working light fixtures, wires not hanging out of the wall and missing decor that left paint chipped and a phone that was flashing bright red every 2 seconds. I called and asked first how to clear the voicemail that was clearly on this phone prior to my arrival. I asked if the room had been inspected prior to my arrival/check in, to which I was assured it was. I informed her that 3 lightbulbs were out and she tried to tell me that the fixtures were suppose to be like that.. making no sense at all... Lamps have lightbulbs in them to make.. Light when turned on. I asked her if she was aware that there was wall decor missing from the wall and a hole in the wall which had loose exposed wires hanging out of it to which she informed me they were ""remodeling."" I asked if that was normal to put guests in rooms with wires exposed especially when I knew they had many open rooms available I could have been placed in. Lastly I asked if they had a mattress pillowtopper or something to help make the bed not so hard which she repeatedly said she did not know what I meant and I nicely said the bed is like a rock and asked if they had any type of topper to make it softer which she said no and then went on to say that the beds were ""Tempur Pedic"" and that they ""took some time for them to get use to your body but thats how they were suppose to be... This bed was not tempur pedic and my back the next morning can attest to it never ""warmed up to me."" Lastly when I went into the bathroom later I noted that the toilet paper roll was less that 1/4 left and the sides of it were dirty. I went to wash my face before bed and there was long dark hair on the towels that were stacked neatly as ""new/clean."" 
I was not happy AT ALL with my experience at this hotel and I felt that the customer service was horrible and did not care to resolve the problems or even address the problems, instead justifying them.

The best finger food there is(sorry sushi) and have ate at and reviewed just about every place in town that is worth reviewing but every time I get caught up in a conversation about it, people bring this place up as the best. Even to the point of being dismissive of my opinion since I had not.

  I really wanted to knock this one out in 2020 but being an ""essential worker"" has made it hard to do anything this season, but I digress.

  I went here on a Saturday night a couple weeks back and it was lightly seated, with delivery drivers seeming to make most of their business. They have a good selection of hard spirits and beer behind the bar. Limited seating in an already somewhat cozy space.

  I ended up taking to the kitchen manager before I ordered to find out how the wings were cooked.  Mainly because I prefer a fried chicken wing to a baked one.  Its a texture thing.

  They actually par bake the chicken beforehand and finish it in the fryer.  I imagine this is because the wings themselves are very meaty. Like twice the size of a normal buffalo wing.  If you tried to deep fry something big and meaty, you tend to overcook the outside and leave the inside a little rare.

  The result is chicken that has a more roasted texture, rather than crispy fried. Think a rotisserie chicken.  Juicy and flavorful. No, It doesn't have very crispy skin but it's still very good.  It is also served fast, probably less than 7 min.  

  Then there is the toppings, which consisted of peppers, garlic and parm.  Perfectly accented th chicken without overpowering it or making me want to scrape off the detritus before I dipped it in the house made ranch. Which, by the way, is the best ranch I've had.

  So yes, Noble Pie knocks it out of the park with their wings.  Not something I will seek out when I am wanting traditional style but definitely something I will suggest to anyone wanting a nice, juicy and meaty wing.  Of which there are plenty.",2021-01-06 17:20:42,409,1975,

He jams 10-15 clients into one appointment session and because of this your appointment is always late and beyond rushed. I moved here from San Diego for my husbands orders to NAS Fallon last December. Sierra Mountain Health was the place I was referred to and Dr Assad took me as a patient. I had to wait 3 months to get an appointment so was completely out of my ADD medication, and had about a weeks worth of Welbutrin left. I was taking Welbutrin for mild to moderate depression, and have a pretty severe case of ADD and take Adderall twice a day which allows me to hold a job, focus, and get work done. First appointment I walked in, he barely glanced up, asked me what I was on and the dosage. He dropped my dosage on the Adderall to half what I was used to taking and cut me off completely from the Welbutrin, cold turkey. I tried to voice my opinions on this and he said and I quote : ""you don't know what you need, and you are too young to be on antidepressants"" (I'm 32). WHAT?!? 
He then prescribed me less then 30 days of the new adderall dosage handed me my prescription, cut me off while I was still trying to talk to him and said see you in 30 days, go to my other practice, pay $40 CASH only and get a urine test before I see you again. I asked if this was covered by insurance, no, tried to ask if I could go elsewhere for this that would be covered again, no. 

Every month I'm required to drive an hour and a half to Reno in the middle of the workweek to pick up a prescription for Adderall and have to take a  ""personal half day"" as I have 3 hours of driving, and another hour waiting for my appointment (he's always late at least by 30 mins-1 hour) for a 30 second appointment where I'm greeted with ""how many pills do you have left"". I don't even have time to sit on the couch before he angrily hands me a prescription while taking a personal call or is on his phone doing whatever for less then 30 days supply and then makes me leave (all while never actually bothering to look at me or ask how I am doing or feeling. If i say I have 2-3 left (to give me time to get my prescription into the pharmacy and then pick it up) he gives me less for that month (even when I explained its to give me a day or two to fill it as i have to go back to work). If i try to ask questions he cuts me off, dismisses anything I say, tells me to leave the door open on my way out, then goes back to his personal phone call dismissing me completely. 

I'd missed my last appointment due to car trouble, but was rescheduled the following week. Day before I get a phone call saying he canceled because of a family emergency. Okay fine, it happens. Made another appointment for the following week. At this point I've been out of meds for a while. Canceled again due to a vacation he took. Then Christmas and New Years week they were closed or don't have any appointments available. So I go today. After a 45 minute wait I go in he asks the same question on how many i have left (while on the phone saying he will pick someone up in like 5-10 minutes- so glad my time is valuable) i say none because the last two appointments were canceled by him, he hangs up the phone checks my chart and yells at me that its my fault I'm out, he hasn't seen me since October (wrong, i was there in November) and then cuts my already drastically reduced dosage in half again because ""you haven't been on it in a while, you probably don't need it anyways, and it'll make you jittery for being off of it since October.

I'd never used movers before so I was a bit apprehensive. Old city was mega communicative in the planning process. 

They asked that I procure the no parking permit. It was easy to procure online (https://stsweb.phila.gov/tnp/tlzApplication.aspx). I emailed a copy of the permit to Old City when I received it in email. If memory serves it took 1-2 weeks. The day of the move, I went to my local police station and asked for the no parking signs. I expected to need the permit, but it was a very fast very easy interaction. 

When the movers arrived, they did a 3-point turn with the moving truck on my narrow street to back into my driveway. I was impressed from jump. 

I was only having them move my furniture, not my boxes. I did a walk through of what I wanted them to take and what they didn't need to do. They took it from there!

I'm usually wary of hourly rates and people moving without much haste, but these guys WERE MOVING! Bing bang boom they had the truck loaded up. When I saw how fast they were moving  I seriously regretted not having them move my boxes as well. 

The unloading was also well handled by the crew. However, I learned a few things. First, in the future I might use a labeling system to let the movers know where to unload the items (living room/basement/guest room etc). it was easy for me to give directions as they unloaded the truck but it made me feel a bit awkward. Next, I learned that movers aren't allowed to take adjustable mattress bases apart and large bases don't always fit up your narrow staircase. (Also the company that sold you an adjustable base won't let you hire their movers). 

I provided water bottles at both locations and a late morning/lunch time snack at my new place. The movers seemed to really appreciate it. 

In addition to totally rocking the move and moving at the speed of light, all three movers were SO NICE! They all complimented my new home (sounded like it might be part of their training but I'm here for it!). I had a couch that NEARLY didn't make it through the front door and they worked their asses off to make it happen! Also, said couch (a sectional) did not fit in my planned configuration. The movers rearranged the couch and suggested a ""conversational"" layout. I've received lots of compliments on it so they also gave me some interior decorating services. 

Did I mention they came in under estimate??

All in all, I was wowed and would (and will) highly recommend them to friends in the future!",2021-01-07 00:13:24,539,2580,

We installed a Delta 'Charmaine' faucet (#19962Z-RBSD-RST, in rubbed bronze) in our kitchen four years ago as part of a full remodel.  About a year ago or so, the spray wand - which has a toggle switch on the backside that changes it from an aerated stream to a wider spray - had been getting harder to toggle back and forth.  It got to the point that we literally could not switch it without the use of some Channel-Lock pliers.
So being the good engineer, I took the wand apart and attempted to lubricate the slide valve's O-rings with plumber's grease and later with some WD-40.  Both lubricants lasted a day or so before it got hard to toggle again.  I even replaced the two O-rings on the slide valve, but that failed too.  A new wand was $95.00 online!  Ummm, nope!
So I went online and sent Delta Customer Service a message describing my dilemma and asking them for guidance on a good lubricant...and if it was possible to purchase new innards (slide valve) to make it work again.  They were kind enough to reply and said that the wand was not ""consumer-serviceable"" and that WD-40 would only swell the O-rings (which it did...)  Then they asked me what model I had and when I bought it (and from whom.)  I answered those questions and fully expected to hear the reply that the, ""wand was out of warranty...thank you much...and goodbye.""  But nope.  I next got an email with an attached invoice that indicated that Delta was sending me a new wand (model #RP82234RB)...at no cost to myself!
Sure enough, the band new wand arrived (along with a new hose which I did not need...) and I installed it straight away!  And the new wand looks great and works perfectly!  So how can you beat that?  
Very much appreciate Delta Faucet Customer Service and all the CSRs that responded to me and made the decision to send me a new and free wand!  Thank you all for some great support!

I don't understand a man with such a beautiful establishment would choose or have any reason to treat his employees the way he does. It's really is a shame. Rail City is almost magical but it's wasted potential. He doesn't
 try to hide the fact that he drinks almost daily on the job, he doesn't talk to people with respect and gender equality is an issue there. I saw a coworker one day struggling to lift something, another coworker and I went over to help. Within  ten minutes we got it moved from point A to B then Paul comes out and yells in front of his customers that it's a ""one-man job "" he angrily got into the company truck from the parking space, backed up and hit a customers car. The costumers were shocked and apologized several times. He's intolerable and irrational. Thankfully we were given one of the best supervisors,  John who had our back. He expressed "" knowledge is power"" and wanted everyone to learn and succeed in our work areas we're placed in. Also the valuable advise said between coworkers was the motivation to stay positive and continue working for Paul. My first sale in a section I didn't work because the tree specialist had resigned from the fuckery as well were seven trees estimated to be about $1400 worth.

Firstly, I know this sounds weird but the steps to get to top golf are huge. I'm sure you can ask for something wheel chair accessible but you'd have to send someone up to the top to get the elevator, if they even have one.

Reservations were sold out online so we called ahead. They don't take reservations over the phone...we drove all the way there on a Sunday, didn't think the wait was going to be too long....it was a two hour wait!!!! WE WERE SHOCKED!!! 

What was even more shocking was the careless attitudes of the employees. They had no idea what was going on and it was obvious. I asked the first employee how long the wait was she said 2 hours. She then directed me to the ""desk"" to make my reservation. I asked the desk how long the reservation was and he said ""oh about 1-2 hours... lol okay well that's a big margin.. I asked some questions about coupons to which he didn't know the answer two. The desk also told the person in front of me not to leave because they will not hold their place in line? I found this odd bc he didn't tell me this. 
Also, if you go before noon it's $27, between 12-5 it's $37 but after 5pm it's $47. Since we got there at 3pm I wanted to be sure we pay the $37 price. However, the price is NOT BASED on what time you get there...instead it's based on what time they call you after their wait. Therefore, even tho we got there at three, since the wait is two hours- I could be paying the 5pm price AFTER I already waited TWO HOURS! This is soooo crazy to me!

We went to grab something to eat and approx 1hr and 15min later we got a text to tell us our bay will be ready in 15 minutes ... we went back to TG when I noticed that the bottom bays were SSSOOO close to the ground.

In fact, the curbs outside in the parking lot were higher than the bottom row of bays. I am confused how it can be called ""top golf"" when you're 12inches off the ground? I am also in disbelief that the top tier and the bottom tier pay the same amount when the experience is completely different? 

I asked them what bay we will be on to which again, they had no idea. Wait, you told me it will be ready in 15minutes but you don't know which one it will be?? I asked if we can be on the top tier or the second tier to which they replied WE WOULD HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER 45 MINUTES?! 

About 20mins later we got a text saying our bottom tier bay will be ready in 5 minutes.

This whole thing was a mess and I absolutely would not recommend coming here.

Staff lied to me several times: when I asked for COVID test as I was traveling soon (I asked several times which test was the PCR one required by destinations for travel and was told by the receptionist that she would check for me, but required me sign a form and swipe my card in the mean time before being tested or verifying what I needed). Then, when I was *almost* given the wrong test after asking AGAIN for the PCR/ travel test required, at least 3 different staff members assured me that the test I needed was not the paid one, that they weren't sure why I was told to pay as I just needed the free one, and that my refund would be processed no problem, so to please go to the front desk once done with the test.

After waiting several minutes post test in the examination room, a short-haired redhead woman bolted in WITHOUT A MASK ON and in a very rude, condescending, elevated tone pointed at a form stating I signed it and it says no refunds. I'm sorry, I was LIED TO by several of your staff (first about the wrong test so I pay up instead of having the free one done; then promised a refund would be handled and not to worry and even told my dissatisfaction was justified)...to then have someone yell at me, maskless, spitting microparticules on my face amid a pandemic...?! Disgraceful bait and switch tactic, if you ask me. I was baffled. 

All this happened after being in the clinic for nearly 3 hours waiting, missing work. I cried the rest of the day, $170 poorer (they did the same thing to my husband, so was charged for two tests even though we NEVER needed the paid one...).

Oh, and this was back in October 2020 -- and I never received my PCR test results (even though my husband did), so we had to CANCEL our trip that week. I cried for another day.

It's January 2021 -- and I never received my results from that October 2020 visit.

Suffice to say, we will never come back to this facility and have also told our friends to never trust their care and health to them.",2021-01-07 00:20:51,449,2120,

I can't imagine how the family that owns the restaurant operating out of this aging structure can afford to weather this while whatever fire safety changes that are needed are made to the building.  Pho Bac is - or maybe was - a true 'mom n pop', family owned restaurant serving dishes which are truly Vietnamese and until Pho Nguyen - another 'mom n pop' husband and wife owned eatery - opened in 2019 Pho Bac was my favorite place for my favorite Vietnamese rice noodle dish Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio.  It wasn't only because it was prepared so well at Pho Bac, because it was, it is because the sweet, aged woman who owns this worked so hard and because she was so kind to my husband and me.  

That kindness started on our first visit, which was the tail end of what looked like a busy lunch hour for her restaurant where she was, as was usual we found, the only server and with maybe only one cook in the kitchen the food was taking time to be delivered to tables and to have checks delivered.  Some diners were impatient with her.  As I observed how hard she was working and at her age, it made me appreciate what immigrant families are willing to do to assemble better lives - including for the little girl who I assume may have been a granddaughter given her young age, who seemed to be doing schoolwork at an empty table.  

When this lovely woman finally managed to make it to our table to take our order the impatient eaters had departed and others were waiting to pay I said to her, "" I can see you have had a busy day.  We are not in a hurry. You must be tired.""   You could see her relax.  

So was our introduction to her business and not only did she take the time to explain our dishes when she delivered them (although we both knew what they were), she even took the time to help me prep mine (thinking, I guess, that I didn't know how to do it) and with the rush over to talk for  little while.  We we departed she said she hoped to see us again.

But noting the sign on their door the other day when I thought we might go in for take out (we have not been eating in anywhere since mid March 2020), it made me realize just how long it has been since we were inside.

I hope very much that this nice woman and her family will be able to reopen Pho Bac.  It was not a swank place but pride of ownership was evident in how well it was maintained inside for what it was in the old building.  And their Bun dishes were delicious.",2021-01-25 19:40:32,546,2589,

Nothing impressive here just the standard soup and salad you would expect with your hibachi dinner. We also got a crab Rangoon roll and I'm so glad we did! The crab was fully cooked and was rolled with cream cheese and deep fried in tempura batter. The dinner itself was great! I had got the chicken and steak and ordered the steak medium, it was a little over cooked but still had a great taste. Hubby got the salmon and I enjoyed his better than mine! This was covered in teriyaki sauce and had a good char from the grill We were here for the husbands birthday and they made a big ordeal about it from the hibachi chef and the wait staff singing happy birthday and having him make a wish on the complimentary dessert. Thanks for going above and beyond and making him feel special!Dessert was a fried tempura ice cream sundae. I enjoyed this as much as I did the actual meal. I mean how do they deep fry something without melting the ice cream?! This also had a little bit of a sponge cake inside of it as well so we could have our cake and eat it too. Our chef was awesome and I know he does this more times than he would like to count each day, but he did a great job of keeping the children in our group entertained as well as the adults, and did a great job of cooking all of that food.

A month ago a repair person came (collected the $70) and said he needed to order a part that was in Tallahassee.  Due to the cost and the age of the dishwasher, I wanted to get in touch with my husband who is deployed to see if he wanted to replace it or fix it.  I called the repair person less than 24 hours later and confirmed that we wanted to go a head with the repair and to please order the part.  

Two weeks went by with no word from the repair person or the company.  I called.  I was told that the repair person stated that I declined service and the part was not ordered.  I assured the parts person that was not the case and asked her to order the part.  She said it would be in the following week and they would call to set up service once it was received.  

Two more weeks pass with no word from the company again.  I call, again.  First call, I was told that the part should be there in a day or two and that someone from the service department would call the following day.  No one called the next day.  Call two, I was told that the part had been drop shipped and they would have to call the manufacturer to get more details.  Someone would call me the following day. No one called.  Call three, I was placed on hold for ten minutes.  Call four, I spoke to someone who told me they had no idea or way of knowing when the part would be delivered (this is the same person I had spoken to the day before and had promised to call me back and didn't) and that I just needed to wait.  That brings us today.  

I can deal with delays and understand we are in a pandemic which is slowing down all kinds of things.  However, don't make promises to a customer that you can't keep, and when you tell a customer that you will call them the following day with an update, then keep your word.  The attitude that this woman had acting like I was being unreasonable when she and other representatives from this company were the ones who has said they would call to update, and then (on four separate occasions) didn't follow up. 

Honestly, if I hadn't already invested the $70 in the initial service call, I would have gone with another company when they hadn't ordered the part in the first place.",2021-01-15 22:48:13,496,2309,

The issue with this store is lax enforcement of mask wearing mandates. With the positivity rate being so high in Philadelphia, there is no excuse for this.

I have shopped this store four times since it opened and on two of those visits, someone just in front of me in line removed their mask to talk (or yell).

In the first incident, the customer first asked if they could cut in line because they were only buying bread. Then, when at the register, the customer caused a delay due to having no money. I paid for the order so that I would not have to linger any longer than needed in her presence. I would have appreciated it if someone from the store had requested that she put her mask on during this situation.

The second instance was a bit were disturbing. This occurred on New Year's Eve, around 5 PM. A group of three women, just ahead of me in the line, all lowered their masks and began very loudly and boisterously talking and shouting to each other. Not angrily, just without regard to manners or safety. They did use profanities, which is unwelcome as well. But primarily, the scene of three customers mass course and continuously talking loudly shouting was disturbing. This is explicitly the sort of behavior that creates a risk of disease transmission.

Unfortunately, during the New Year's eve incident, store employees made no effort whatsoever to change the behavior of these customers. Because of their antics, they held up the entire will check out line until the manager opened another register and began checking out customers who are stuck behind his group. Meanwhile, the security guard who was by the door and present when the group began its antics, mysteriously disappeared and definitely did not make any effort to intervene. This is all extraordinarily disconcerting given dire situation with the COVID-19 pandemic and the current knowledge about how easily it may be transmitted in an indoor space.

This store needs training for its employees and he needs a policy that mandates its customers maintain proper social distancing and mask wearing during the entirety of their visit. Hopefully this situation will be resolved promptly, I intend to try shopping at the store several more times, and if it is addressed I will increase the review rating.",2021-01-02 16:46:07,456,2398,

The people who scheduled the appointment told me that the company works with your insurance so there is no out of pocket expense. I'll start by pointing out that this was the only reason we even entertained the idea. 

The salesperson ANDY was early, and for the most part, courteous. The sales pitch went as expected. When we got to the pricing phase,  I made a point to remind him that we only agreed to this estimate because I was told that they would work with my insurance company so I would have no out of pocked expense.

At this point ANDY told us that was not true. He said the windows pay for themselves since we were guaranteed to save 40% on our energy costs. My wife asked the smart question of ""guaranteed or else what?"" What do I get in the event that I don't save 40% on my power bill? ANDY didn't have an answer for that. The ""guarantee"" was very vague, and extremely unconvincing, especially considering I had already been lied to once. 

He quoted a price which was way too expensive.  We were told the quote was good for a year, and since we needed time to think about this, we figured we would decline to sign anything until we had time to do our homework on this matter. 

ANDY calls in a ""manager"" Named ALEX on the phone who will be able to sweeten the deal. From the very beginning, I could tell this guy ALEX was just a hustler. From the beginning he's just smooth talking trying to butter me up. He immediately offers a discount in the amount of $4,000 in order to use our house as a ""showcase"" where they would take ""before"" and after pictures to use as advertisement. The other half of the deal involved a promise to leave the company a 5 star review as well. I like my house, but I wouldn't pay $4,000 for pictures of it. And if you're offering that big of a discount in exchange for a review, something isn't right. 

We then asked for an estimate for the cost of replacing the windows on the west side of the house, since those are the ones that let in the most heat in the afternoons. There wasn't a huge drop in the cost as much as we would have hoped, and so we told ALEX that we were going to have to wait before agreeing to anything. This is simply not a decision we are going to make on impulse. 

This is where things took a turn for the nasty. ALEX then started getting very pushy, and started asking us if we had any medical issues we were dealing with. VERY INAPPROPRIATE. We told him that wasn't any of his business. My wife then reminded him that we needed time to do some homework, look into the company, the product. My wife then tried to tell him that the pushier someone gets, the more she will say NO. We have to think about this.

ALEX doesn't get the hint. He keeps pushing, saying he's trying to do us a favor. My wife reminds him that this isn't a favor. This is a business arrangement where we exchange money for a product/service. She tells him that the fact that he was so eager to drop the price so drastically in exchange for a few photos and a glowing review was very suspicious. It tells her that maybe the product isn't all that good. 

ALEX then snaps back very angrily saying ""I don't even want to use your house as a 'showcase' anymore. My wife tells him that if he's going to get nasty, he'll get a review, just not the one he wants. ALEX then replies, ""I don't give a fuck about your review"". This is when I looked at ANDY and told him, we're done here and my wife told him he needed to leave immediately. ANDY had a very uncomfortable look on his face, and gathered his things to leave and said that if we changed our minds, the estimate was still good for a year. My wife told him there is no way we would do business with a company who has a representative like that dealing with customers. 

ALEX then calls back trying to add something to the conversation. I told him ""you need to stop talking now"" and when he tried to start making excuses, I said to him, ""You don't come into my house and start using that kind of language directed at my wife.""  His reply, ""man, I'm not even 'in' your house"". He then yells at ANDY to take him off speakerphone. ANDY left at this point, and that's the story. 

If that's how you treat a potential customer, I can only imagine what would happen if there were any service or product issues down the line. There is no way their guarantee has any value in my opinion. When I looked them up online, I wasn't surprised that they had such a low rating. And I also understand why they were so intent on getting us to write a good review.

I waited for the one female employee cleaning the floor in the dining room area to come over to great me and take my order. She was attentive and great.

It only took about ten minutes for the food which is faster than I expected and I was on my way home to eat with my family. 

The food itself was sloppily thrown in the bag and grease and slop ended up soaking through. Being the only other person in the store when I got it , I would have expected the staff had plenty of time to take proper care of the order.

We started to eat our burgers and fries, all of which were extremely greasy and wet. The burger was at best the flavor of a frozen bjs brand patty. I actually would prefer the bjs burger (10for $10.) All very disappointing. And for the 13 dollars we paid per burger was like a kick in the teeth.

Just got back and was told by Lance that he never said that. That Omar relayed what he said was wrong. And he said what am I supposed to do. I cant have my guy take a day to work on your car. We will sale more cars in the next three months and I cant do that. So now we are stuck in a 10,000 bill 4k worth of repairs we cant afford it looks like our only option is to give it back and get a repo on our credit. We are regular people we need a car and cant afford to just go get another. My gfs daughter has to get to and from school. This is all so wrong on so many levels.

Tonight was our 2nd visit here, the first being via invite by friends. That visit was just ok, nothing memorable. 

This time, though.....

One Star, for simply being open and having the lights on. That's about the best thing I can say. 

Service: 
Terrible to say the least. After eventually being seated, we were ignored for at least 5 minutes. Finally, someone strolled up, dropped chips & salsa on the table and walked away. Not even a ""hello"". Another 5 minutes later, a different person with an equally robotic personality comes up and takes our drink order then scurries away. 5 minutes later, same person returns with waters, says drinks will follow. At this point, I'm a little irritated... because two of us ordered tea. Is there really a difference in effort between putting water in those cups versus tea? But because we're hungry and focused on her finally taking our food order, the drink thing didn't register with me for a couple minutes. 
Anyway, she gets our food order and disappears. 
10 minutes pass... no drinks... and no food.
Well except the chips & salsa, and water. 

Food (what we got at least):
The chips, a little tough. 
The salsa, cold (as in refrigerated cold) and otherwise bad-tasting. 

After 10 minutes of our server being MIA, we gave up and left. 

We're now eating, happily, at Plaza Mexico on 19 in Palm Harbor. Much better atmosphere, excellent service and yummy chips & salsa.

5 stars for the USF docs and for the treatment you will get as inpatient at TGH.  But 1 star for difficulty in getting a followup outpatient appt if you're not already an establish patient and if you don't have the right insurance that they accept.  It's truly as if they don't want want any more patients. 

Based on my personal experience with me and my family members, USF doctors provide WONDERFUL care, they are as good if not better than docs anywhere in tampa and at any other hospital.  

My mom had an issue, she was admitted to TGH and had great care from the ED docs, nurses, USF MAIN internal medicine, USF cardiology, USF electrophysiology teams, she was correctly diagnosed with a heart arrythmia issue and needed a cardiology procedure, it was not urgent or emergent so instead of waiting in the hospital for another week, we all agreed for her to discharged and come back later outpatient.  She was discharged on Friday, we were told by the docs to expect a phone call on Monday because they wanted her to have the procedure within 1 week, by next Friday. 
Here's where the problems began, it was simply impossible for me to get her an outpatient appointment because the outpatient scheduling support staff and scheduling system is just terrible. 
We never got a phone call from USF cardiology.  It is not possible to even call them directly, you have to call the USF health phone number (which is for all specialties for the whole organization I guess), they told me all they could do is send a message to USF cardiology for someone there to call me.  Still no call 1.5 week later, finally with considerable effort and through some contacts I have at the hospital I was able to talk to the USF cardiology scheduler and turns out they don't take my mom's insurance for outpatient appts and procedures.  Would have been nice if they told me this a long time ago or made it easy for me to call in and talk to someone directly to find this out so we didn't have to waste so much time. 
Another example, my uncle passed out, fell, broke this neck, treated at TGH, he did fine as inpatient and was discharged, but he was supposed to followup with USF Neurosurgery outpatient about this broken bone in his neck.  Well just like with USF Cardiology, it was completely IMPOSSIBLE to get an outpatient appt with USF Neurosurgery also, they don't answer their phone and no once calls back if you try to call them to leave a message. 

The USF Health generic phone line operators, they are nice, they will listen to you, but they are useless!  All they can do is pass along a message to USF Neurosurgery or Cardiology to call back, they cannot schedule an appointment for you. Why do they exist if they can't actually do anything except pass along messages? 

So overall, if you go to TGH and are seen and treated by USF docs, they are great, excellent clinicians, explain things well and you will get top notch care as inpatient.  But good luck getting an outpatient appt if you are not already an establish patient with them and good luck even getting a phone call if you don't have the right insurance.",2021-01-31 01:56:57,635,3190,

If your ramen isn't better than basic store bought Black Shin Ramen, you won't see me at your shop. (P.S. If you want to stock up on some, you can find some at 168 Asian Market and Asian Mart, along with the best Jasmine rice for the best price).

This is the closest to authentic ramen I've tried so far.  When eating their ramen, I was reminded of the ramen I would get from Japan Town in San Francisco-full of flair and flavor, with yummy addicting noodles.

I've only eaten at Ramen 4 Real and Ijji noodle house for ramen and felt like they fell short.   I was discouraged and stopped looking for good ramen for a while until I found Haru on Uber Eats. 

Just looking at the fat at top, I could assume that lots of good stock bones were used in making the broth. Got miso and tonkatsu.   A little heavy on the fat-which could turn off some people, but I did skim a little off and fixed it to my taste.

The meat was plentiful and on point. SO FULL OF FLAVOR. They hooked it up fat with noodles. If you're looking to extend one order for two, just order extra broth, split the noodles and order extra meat. I love that there's great balance with the extras they put in with not an overwhelming amount of fixins, though you can customize your order to your heart's desire with plenty to choose from.  You can also adjust the spice level.  

Have you tried Takoyaki before?? I've only had it at one other place-Hinoki Sushi. I didn't think I could find a better Takoyaki-octopus balls made from a batter and filled with other ingredients like picked ginger, green onion, tempura scraps, topped with bonito flakes, Japanese mayo and flavorful sauce (similar to Katsu sauce). Haru's version was much more substantial and loaded with more goodness. If you haven't already tried them, you are missing out. It's not a popular street food in Japan for nothing. 

Their chicken Karaage-marinated chicken coated in a batter then fried- was super yummy and came with a spicy mayo and mayo sauce. 

I ordered a side of pickled radish and that was nice to have because it provided balance to the whole meal, providing acidity, flavor and texture with a crunch. 

A detail that won me over was their egg. Yes, your effort in including the whole egg in one order will pay off Haru.  Also, your nicely packaged food does wonders with visuals.

This is Japanese comfort food done right. 

I can't wait to try the other items on their menu. I know I won't be disappointed.",2021-01-30 14:06:56,521,2494,

I have to eat gluten free so I was super pleased with the build-your-own bowl option for gluten free pasta! The staff changed their gloves right away and knew how to follow protocols so I wouldn't accidentally get gluten in my food. The kids ordered regular mac & cheese with bacon and a grilled cheese with tater tots, and my fiancé got a Cuban sandwich with the mac & cheese bites. All of the entrees can be made into a combo with a drink and a side. The food was really good, and I liked the unique touch of the pasta bowls going through the oven to melt our cheese selections. 

There are a few kinks for the staff to work out as they just opened. We had to repeat our order a couple times as it made its way from start to finish. There were no dessert bars (Rice Krispies, I think?) and we didn't know that until after we paid and got cups of cookies instead. That was fine for everyone but me who would have picked a different combo side since the dessert bar was supposed to be gluten free, but the cookies weren't. Also, the soda machine was out of Powerade and Hi-C, so the lack of carbonated and caffeinated beverages for kids was a little bit of a drawback. Overall, it was nothing that would deter us from coming back, as the staff were super friendly and nice! We also noticed they're using UberEats and DoorDash to deliver.

Anyway, I had a great date night with my wife at Bistro Romano. We've eaten here a few times over the years but it has been a long while since my last time. After today's wonderful meal, I realized I need to come here more often.

Had a 7:30pm reservation for New Years Eve. Philadelphia still has only outdoor seating due to COVID-19, and we sat in our own plastic bubble igloo complete with a propane heater about a 1/2 block from the front door of the restaurant. Had to be a little concerned when the wind blew the ""door"" closed and just about got caught on the heater. Could've had a real ""meltdown."" No one came so I had to save the night and put it back on top of the bubble.

I'm sure that the waitstaff was somewhat happy to get the exercise from the restaurant and bring food and drink to the customers.

Anyway, my wife and I went with the Chef's Choice Tasting Menu. We skipped the wine pairings, but easily made up for it in margaritas and Cosmopolitans. Our meal, which I think I took pictures of everything which hopefully turned out in the dark, consisted of bread with sun-dried tomato and oil, tomato soup with crema fraise, a specifically requested Caesar salad, salmon sushi style with caviar, some of the best pillowy gnocchi I've ever had, a seafood risotto with fillet medallions that was a little too rare for our liking, and a wicked huge piece of moist carrot cake. 

All the food was great. My wife couldn't handle the raw salmon, so I got some extra. As I mentioned, best gnocchi I've ever had in an awesome cream sauce, and the seafood risotto was so tasty. The meat was a little too rare but still good. We each could only finish half our carrot cakes and took them home. We also topped the dessert with some Frangelico and Limoncello cordials.

Service was quite friendly and attentive except for the possible igloo meltdown on the burner. 

$235 not including tip for two Chef's Choice Tastings, six mixed drinks, and two cordials. We had a wonderful date night ending to 2020 at Bistro Romano.",2021-01-01 04:07:08,436,2090,

We started with the blue crab rangoon ($14) which I was really excited about because it's something I always order if it's on the menu and this is a fancy version. Perfectly crisp but flavor left something to be desired and the sauce that accompanied it didn't make up for it (some sort of clear vinegar-ish sauce, not the traditional sweet chili sauce that usually comes with this item elsewhere). The shrimp chili dumplings were dry and not spicy at all (they're very highly rated on here otherwise so maybe the chef was having an off night). The beef and tofu dish was like a chinese version of chili but was also bland.

The peking duck was cooked perfectly but also lacked flavor - even if it was just salt. They also messed with the hoisin sauce... it was thick and not nearly a sweet as it's supposed to be. The pancakes were nice and thin and they gave lots of chopped cucumber and scallion on the side.  

We enjoyed the chili cucumbers (very generous portion wish they were served with some crispy noodles or rice on the side) and I will definitely be running back for the DanDAn noodles... they were outstanding - some of the best I've ever had! 

-1 star for customer service: i ordered a fountain soda and let our waitress know that it was flat and the carbonator needed to be changed. she never brought me a new one. when i ordered another coke towards the end of the meal it was still flat. for a restaurant operating at 50% capacity (and since this restaurant is very small, only servicing 3-4 tables at this time) i would expect better service.",2021-01-21 05:28:05,335,1640,

Then the owner screamed hello at me I thought she was answered the phone instead of screaming at a guest trying to pick out glitter they had at their front desk. They tried forcing a pedicure on me several times and a facial. Then didn't find the color I asked for which was numbered then got mad at me because I didn't want yellow and rose gold glitter when I showed a photo and their glitter isn't numbered. The glitter I wanted was pink and red like the picture I showed.  I was trying my best to be nice they were short staffed but the one doing my nails called me difficult repeatedly and threw a fit and stormed off asking for change and said how much my service was and how much I gave her. And was literally storming and complaining about a 20% tip after her nasty demeanor gave me anxiety literally ruined my day. I asked for a dip fill and she also drilled off one of my nails oddly enough the ring finger (she knew I wanted to keep my nails) and drilled my skin twice. She even complained the nail glitter got on her ugly penguin sweater. Sorry does walmart not sell those in the children's clearance section anymore? My bad your job causes you to get glitter on your clothes no need to make a guest feel bad about it. Some people need to know when to call it quits and find something that makes them happy.

Some of them are so expensive and have the worst quality of food/not enough rolls to justify ordering! Some of the more affordable sushi places just give you a few of the ""plainer"" rolls to choose from and have a limited menu. However, not this place! I stumbled upon them after doing some Christmas shopping and I wanted something nice and simple. I didn't see an online ordering option, but I was able to quickly place my order by phone (oops typo was here previously!) and was quoted 20 mins for pick up. 

When I say this place was busy, this place was BUSY! Parking in front of the restaurant is a joke, and at no fault of the owners. So I recommend parking to the side of the building to avoid the congestion that happens in front of the restaurant. When I got there there were people already waiting in the entry way of the restaurant to be seated and a few picking up to go orders as well. The women at the front desk were super polite and friendly. Since it was so busy my food took a little longer than quoted, but I could tell it was all freshly prepared! I made sure to get my yum yum sauce and I was out the door! 

Let me just say this sushi was soooo good, hit the spot and was well worth what I paid! I'd say the pricing of the sushi is reasonable and they aren't stingy on how many rolls they give you. I only wish I had taken a picture of it before I dug in! It's my new favorite sushi place to go to and I look forward to eating more delicious sushi here too!",2021-01-03 18:43:26,331,1520,

After some shopping nearby at Springfield Mall, I had a taste for some OG and ordered quickly on the app(yup they have an app now).  App sent me a text when my food was ready.  I pulled up into a numbered parking spot, entered it into the app to ""check in"" and my food was brought out to me within a couple of minutes.

My plan was to park up nearby, watch Criminal Minds on Netflix and enjoy my lunch in the car but nooooooooooooo. I ran into another store about 5-6 minutes away, get back into my car, pull the food out and there's NO UTENSILS. Not a spoon, a fork. Nothing! And I specifically checked off silverware on the app when placing my order. Soooo I go into a dollar tree to grab a pack of forks, guess what? They're all out. I go into Five Below. They don't even sell plastic cutlery. UGH!!! Then into CVS and paid $3.08 for a pack of forks. I could have gone back to OG but I was too far away to go back and these stores were closer. 

Sheesh, now I get to my food FINALLY!! I feel the food and it's lukewarm now yall...Insert tears here.  My salad is half brown and wilted. My pasta tastes like someone just poured my food out of a bag with no flavor and it costs $20.

Read the Yelp reviews which were not very positive, but we went nevertheless. So glad we did!!! Fun place located next door/ affiliated with the Holiday Inn. Large outdoor patio, but it was a clear albeit chilly day so we stayed inside.
Fun place with iguanas all over. Fabulous waitress (Destiny) who was helpful with food and drink recommendations. The strawberry/ pineapple mojito was superb with mulled fruit/chunky and generous amounts and delicious. I believe we ordered 3. The pina colada with mango and extra rum floater was tasty with coconut rim( stuck on via honey); two of those!!!
Shots of something were handed out prior to the sun setting, adding to the fun atmosphere!
Food: we decided on appetizers. We started with an iguana shaped pretzel complete with cheese dip: yummy! The grilled oysters were well prepared with the correct amount of cheese and butter. We also got the trio sampler: the fish spread was reminiscent of the whitefish I grew up, with the proper amount of smokiness. The grouper nuggets weren't overly fried. The coconut shrimp was also well cooked, but the accompanying dipping sauce was overwhelming and took away from the taste.

It's got a small menu - but that small menu is sure to have everything you need for a meal. We stopped by this pack weekend. As of January 2021, they are open for takeout only due to COVID. So, we ordered on Toast, drove over, parked, texted a number letting them know we were ready, and they texted back to let us know our order was ready at the takeout window. Easy, quick pickup. We ordered their dessert on the menu this week - a tea and cookies kakigori (a Japanese-style shaved ice) - which (because it's shaved ice) can't be made ahead or packaged to go. So I walked back to my car with a bag of dumplings and shrimp toast in my left had and the bowl of kakigori in my right. We ate it first also (I mean, it's ICE!), and it was great: icy, creamy, with great flavors. Then we had the shrimp toast - which was definitely a different take on shrimp toast than I've had at other restaurants. But it tasted great! Beautifully fried! The dumplings were good, too! And we were able to eat this whole meal in our car while everything was still hot or icy! A fun meal overall! I do think their menu is pretty limited (they only offer one type of dumpling - pork), and they don't offer anything for vegetarians except for the dessert (we aren't, but just FYI). In a single visit, we tried everything on the menu except for the Tsukemen dipping noodles and the other dessert on the menu.

1. Starting off was the complimentary bread which was good but I wish it was served warm. It was accompanied with regular butter.

2. Escargots- It was delicious and the hazelnut butter it was submerged in was amazing. They give three pieces of bread but I recommend saving the complimentary bread they serve to dip in the sauce as well.

3. Steak tartare- The steak was tender and fresh. It was mixed with horseradish which I am not a fan of but my friend really enjoyed this dish. It comes with a small side salad (lettuce with dressing) and honestly that was my favorite part. 

4. Moules Frites- aka the mussels and fries. It was a good dish but I definitely had better mussels elsewhere. The fries were delicious- nice and crispy. 

5. Macaroni Au Gratin- I loved the crispy topping and it was very creamy. They used pasta that looked like long orzo pasta. I think it needed a little bit more salt because it was lacking in flavor. 

Dessert- 
6. Moelleux Au Chocolat- aka lava cake. It was really good. The molten chocolate part tasted like dark chocolate. So get this dish if you like dark chocolate. The hazelnuts gave it a nice crunch. The praline sorbet was a perfect match. There is also a slight saltiness you get as well but it all balances out.

7. Creme Brûlée- torched nicely on top. Creamy inside. Creme brûlée lovers will not be disappointed.

8. Macarons- they give 4 mini macarons which were complimentary because of the birthday! I would not order this though because they were too hard.

I am definitely coming back here to try the other items. It is on the expensive side but I believe it is worth it because of the quality of food you are served.

Of074Iw4yrwmxKNYgX3JKA,0oLUvJnNu2RzFwXLsuaqYQ,Vf0inZOaad8sv1uG8mGIGw,3,7,3,9,"Kobe's has become a yearly tradition in my house as both of my kids have requested it for their birthday dinner. I was a little bit concerned about going there during this Covid-19 dilemma, but decided to bite the bullet and just try and be as safe as possible by taking all of the necessary precautions and hope that the restaurant was doing the same. If you live in Florida like I do, then you know that it is really like the Wild Wild West down here because everything is open, and not in lock down like many other states, so the onus is on you (as well as the business) to make sure that you do as much as you possibly can to try and prevent yourself from getting infected. All of the hand washing, sanitizer and mask wearing won't do you any good if the place you're visiting isn't following the same criteria. 
              Keeping the above in mind, and if you've never been to a Kobe's before, this place is the very definition of community dining. You're seated around a gigantic flat top grill, and you are sharing the experience with others who are seated right next to you. Each grill seats about 10 people, so I wondered how Kobe's was going to manage the whole social distancing thing, since normally you are sitting right next to strangers. Would they be placing one of those giant plexiglass partitions in between each party? Maybe keep a chair or two between each party empty? Well sir, that answer would be NO! Welcome to Kobe's! Would you care for some COVID with your fried rice? Needless to say, I was pretty mortified, but just tried to stay positive and do my best to try and keep me and the kids as safe as possible (kudos to my kids for having to deal with their old man as I think we went through an entire bottle of sanitizer that night, as I repeatedly made them bathe in it). 
          Now, was the staff wearing masks and appearing to abide by the cleaning mandates, yes, and I don't blame them. Restaurant workers are on the front lines busting their ass to make a living and should be applauded (and compensated well) for all that they're doing, so this goes back to the restaurant owners themselves. I realize that your bottom line has probably taken a beating over the last year, but that doesn't mean that you should be able to operate independently of what every other restaurant in this state has been doing to try and keep everyone safe. Every other restaurant I've been to in my city has gone above and beyond to try and keep their patrons as safe as possible by distancing their customers or providing partitions to make sure that people can enjoy their food without fear of contracting a deadly virus. Kobe's on the other hand seems to be able to operate on their own terms, and the fact that they are allowed to do so is troubling. I honestly don't get it. 
        I apologize for my rant above, as I'm not normally a social justice warrior, but I just couldn't believe what I was seeing. It's not fair that all of the small businesses in the Tampa Bay Area are abiding by the LAW, yet a corporate behemoth like Kobe's gets to just operate with impunity, un-freaking-believable!!!
         Anyway, all in all it was a good night. The kids were ecstatic, our chef was funny, the wait staff was attentive, and the food was good, it always is. Besides my issues with the whole safety protocols lacking, my only real gripe with Kobe's (and always has been) is the prices. There is no way on God's green earth that you can get out of Kobe's without spending over $100, which is why we only go for birthdays.

A few weeks ago I bought a chewy watermelon hyppe & not even 6 hours in, it became super hard to get a pull & completely stopped working. It was too late to go exchange it so I just said whatever & threw it away. Today, I bought another hyppe from this same smoke shop & once I stepped out of the shop, I tried to use it & noticed it wasn't pulling. When It finally started working, the light stayed on and would continue burning without me even touching it. We went back inside to try to exchange it & the employee said that the Hyppes ""never really mess up"" & are ""better than the puffs"" & disregarded everything we said. He said he couldn't do anything about it cause it still worked? Not even 3 hours later.. the hyppe doesn't light up; No smoke is coming out. I called the shop & talked to the same guy & he basically said ""sorry, I can't do anything about that"" even though I had reminded him that I had showed him when it wasn't working properly after I had first bought it. 
On another note, I've noticed several times that the younger guy working here never has a mask. Shouldn't businesses be following the CDC regulations on COVID & require face masks for each person in the store? Whether they're customers or employees? Goes to show they really don't care about the safety of themselves or others. 
So in summary, their products used to be good but as of recently, each one that I've gotten has been defective. The owner should really reconsider his employees, as well as how serious they are taking this pandemic. As much as I used to love purchasing from them, I will not be returning again.",2021-01-29 03:44:17,371,1736,

It's amazing that every region of this country has its own special foods and we have the chance to taste all of them if we want! 

When I'm asked about the West Coast it is hands down Bahn Mi & Vietnamese Coffee! It's a craving I get often and one that's way harder to satisfy than most. I fell in love with Bahn Mi & Vietnamese Coffee when my boss would bring them to the office for me and they are just those flavors that bring back fun memories. I love how food can do that! So needless to say I was really excited when I found out about Bahn Mi and Roll Plus...was this going to be the Bahn Mi I have been craving!!?? I reached out to the establishment to see if by any chance they also had Vietnamese Coffee....the thrill was a little overwhelming when they said ""YES WE DO!"". I immediately sent my husband a message telling him that I may have found the answer to our Bahn Mi & Vietnamese coffee prayers! 

First off the atmosphere is super fun. Brightly colored yellow walls perfect for a hungry appetite. Black and white street art perfect for those Insta & YELP Pics! Bright, happy, & cheerful!  Since we are still living with this Pandemic I will add that they seemed to take things seriously. It was contact free service separated by a partition and everyone was wearing masks so we felt comfortable ordering and waiting a bit for our order. 

I went for the 5 spice chicken Bahn Mi (no onion because the allergy) and no Jalapeño because I just don't like it on my Bahn Mi. They were happy to accommodate the allergy and remove the items I requested. The bread was a traditional Vietnamese Roll which is so soft it's like a cloud. The kind when you smush it, it stays. I'm a total bread baby so I pay attention to that part in every sandwich I eat. The chicken was spicy, tender, and juicy. I felt like there was a bit much in the sandwich making it hard to eat and a bit more of a heavy Bahn Mi. Next time I think I'll ask for less chicken and more of the pickled veggies. The pickled veggies were perfection. So crisp and the perfect amount of pickle. The tartness of the pickled veggies with the sweet spicy chicken was such a delicious combination. 

I was really excited to see the Vietnamese coffee walking my way and couldn't wait to taste it. They mostly do Boba teas here so there was the option to get the tapioca balls in the coffee but I'm a purest and opted not to add them. I'm also not a fan of boba so I really couldn't give a non biased review of that part of their menu. Lol. The Vietnamese Coffee was good, not the best I've had but it would satisfy the craving when I had it.  I'm sure just like coffee itself, Vietnamese coffee probably tastes very different every place you go. 

Overall I'm sure we will be visiting Bahn Mi and Roll Plus again. It is the best Bahn Mi I've had in Nashville so far and while I'll continue searching for that perfect West Coast Bahn Mi, this was a good one that I could eat again and again!",2021-01-05 21:25:09,669,3101,

After paying for my dogs bath I waited for them to bring my dog to the front desk. A woman comes in clearly frazzled and tells me my dog got out. She said he pushed through his kennel and knocked through two doors to escape and the last thing she heard he was near the Burger King on Kietzke. I was so angry in that moment as this woman stood in front of me acting like I had this terrible dog, never once saying she was sorry or that someone was out looking for him. No, she stopped looking. Unbelievable! I have a 1.5 year old golden doodle by the way. He is still a puppy but not some mean unruly dog. My husband called the owner who took zero accountability. This guy said our dog has a history of biting his kennel. What?!! They have never told us that before and honestly, who cares. If you know a dog has a higher likelihood of getting out of a kennel, you take extra precautions or tell us beforehand you won't be able to see our dog. The whole conversation was pointless and it just left me feeling sick that these people didn't care that my dog was running the streets of downtown Reno. 

A kind women found our dog about 7 miles away and called it in. It's a miracle he wasn't hit by a car. The pads of his feet were completely worn off and bloody. He can barely walk. 

The bottom line is, things happen, people are human. I would still have been upset by this situation but would not be writing this review had the employees/owner acted even slightly concerned. Instead, they only came off as frustrated and annoyed that they had to deal with this occurrence. I'm not about ""the cancel culture"" but since no one took accountability let alone even apologized, there is a high likelihood that this kind of a thing will happen again. Do your dog a favor and go somewhere else.",2021-01-16 17:52:59,394,1850,

If you don't order the Pork Collar or Sweet Potato,  you're missing out. If you are feeling adventurous, try the Broccoli Bagna Cauda with it's white anchovies and marcona almonds.

I was especially excited to see Risotto Del Mar on the menu. I love risotto and seafood! So, of course, I ordered that...I was really anticipating eating it (I am sure you know what I am talking about). My partner ordered a beef burger and we ordered some breaded shrimp. This was all to go. 

When I opened the ordered, it looked nothing like Risotto. The key ingredient for risotto is rice. I mean, it's called risotto for a reason. Unfortunately, their version of risotto had may be six grains of rice (I looked hard for the grains). So, I kind of assumed that they mixed up the order. I called the restaurant up, and of course, I had to repeat my story to three different people....that was the day they were playing pass the phone game...that or, I am just a good story teller. Oh well, the last person to come on phone was Sean, the manager. He asked me to describe the dish I got. And, then wanted to make sure that I didn't get gnocchi instead. I told him that it was not gnocchi, it was just some kind of melted cheese with oil (it was really that!). He told me that it was risotto and may be it doesn't fit my definition of risotto. I had to tell him the definition of risotto and of course let him know that it fits no one's definition of risotto. At this point, he wanted to show that they believe in customer service, so he tells me that he wants to do something for me and asked me if I eat there regularly.  When I told him that it was the first time, he tells me that the next time, I visit Bone Fish, I should let the person taking my order know that Sean told me that they would do something for me! Ha! May be next time they will roll a red carpet for me. Wait, there will be no next time....because I typically go to a restaurant for good food, not for a comic experience.",2021-01-02 20:36:08,433,1889,

Husband, Adrian, is the baker and he comes to it both by nurture - his dad (whose photo sits in a frame at the kitchen window) was a baker starting in the 1940's and Adrian grew up to see how it is done right and by nature, I suspect, given the joy Adrian radiates as you see him through the window into his sparkling kitchen is delightful.  Charming wife who extends gracious welcome to all who enter, Robyn, runs the front of house and does the packaging.  She says that indeed baking in his kitchen was her husband's ""happy place"".   Having had the opportunity to sample several delicous things from Bella Biscotteria we think you can taste that joy in the goodies.

This couple literally created this bakery with their own labor, and Adrian had a pretty bad accident associated with it that slowed down their ability to get it open.  That they persevered, even to open in a pandemic  is a very good thing for those of us who can enjoy their products.

THE GOODIES:  We are fortunate to have a great neighbor who is a friend of the owners and knowing my husband's 100% Italian heritage our neighbor figured artisan Italian bakery treats would be a good fit for us to taste as he was given samples when Adrian and Robyn were fine tuning recipes and baking ovens.  Lucky us!   Our neighbor would deliver and we'd taste and then we waited eagerly for Bella to open.  Now that they have, my husband can hang up his home baker's  biscotti apron.  Being Brooklyn born and reared in an Italian neighborhood with good Italian bakeries on every block he found local biscotti lacking but now he is very happy to let Adrian do the biscotti baking for him for excellent biscotti.  

Bella's biscotti come in multiple flavors and individually wrapped and are available unwrapped too.  My husband's fav way to buy them is in a package I think they call ""bits and ends"", which are broken pieces or end pieces, to dunk in coffee, espresso and sometimes even wine.  As Robyn, who also has Italian heritage, and my husband will tell you growing up in an Italian family one becomes 'dunker'.

Bella Biscotteria also make other Italian treats including but not limited to ricotta love knot cookies, Italian breakfast cookies, Italian butter cookies, Italian apricot filled cookie 'tartlets, fruit filled hand pies and muffins with cannoli flavors.  They also make delicious pastry cream filled puff pastries in pasticceri and pasticerrino sizes and also cannoli which is, in the true form, filled with cannoli cream at the point of purchase to keep it crisp.

Also they bake focaccia in several varieties and only on Saturdays so those need to be pre ordered unless you get lucky, as we did today, and they have a handful of extras.

CALLING AHEAD DOESN'T HURT: Being newish-ly opened they are still learning what works to bake in what amounts on what days.  So calling in an order ahead can be a good thing.  (As in last week we missed out on the lemon cookies.  This week we called ahead.)  

GIFTING:  Valentine's Day is coming up.  Mother's Day, Father's Day, Graduation...you get the idea.  One can't eat flowers and the biscotti and cookies last longer than a bottle of bubbles.  Just saying.  They'll think fond thoughts of you with every bite for several days. :-) 

LOCATION:  Tucked at the back of one of Eagle's older and oddly designed strip malls (at some point Eagle thought old West with awkward walkways was charming...it's not) it is worth the search to find it. 

PARKING:  Small private lot has awkward angle in, very small spaces but at least it is parking.  

ACCESSIBILITY:  The store is level in the door and all on one floor.  ADA parking space at far end of lot with walkway.

HOURS:  Check their Facebook page for hours as they can change.   Currently open Wed - Sat / 9a - 3p.  

COVID19 MANAGEMENT:  They do an excellent job here.  Robyn wears a mask front of house.  Mask required sign posted on door for customers and enforced.  Good for them!",2021-01-30 20:36:49,819,4078,

 I have several issues with this apartment complex that I can get into, some of which I noticed have already been been mentioned here by others posting here on Yelp, but the one issue that is most pressing for me and making me wonder if I can stand one more day here is NOISE!!!

 I've rented and lived in apartment complexes for most of my adult life going back 30+ years or so and thought I've seen it all, but this apartment complex has to be the absolute worst designed and constructed apartment complex I've ever lived in particularly with respect to noise and vibrational abatement.

 I feel like I'm living in a paper mache cardboard dollhouse or something !!

 I can't believe it's even legal to design and construct apartment complexes like this without any consideration for noise and vibrational abatement !!

 I purposely chose an apartment on the top floor of one of the buildings in the back of the complex that was furthest from the traffic noise along Gandy Blvd., and that I didn't have to worry about someone living above me and stomping above my ceiling.

 At the time I scouted out the location of this apartment, I didn't notice any traffic along Brighton Bay Blvd. which is just maybe 150 feet from this apartment I ended up renting.

 That all changed the day I moved in when I immediately noticed the significant amount of traffic along Brighton Bay Blvd., and then subsequently further noticed later after moving in the amount of traffic noise coming from all that traffic on Brighton Bay Blvd. 

 Particularly, the almost constant low frequency vibrational rumbling coming from the seemingly endless number of muscle performance cars, utility vehicles, pickup trucks, and motorcycles with open muffler exhaust systems all doing well over the posted speed limit of 25 MPH and constantly accelerating like maniacs as if Brighton Bay Blvd. is some sort of speedway or something.    
 
 Some of these same vehicles also operate in the parking lot and parking spaces and rented garages below my apartment. 

 Some residents here rent garages four floors below my apartment for their muscle cars, and every time these cars start up it sounds like there's an explosion going off in the building!!!

 This occurs regularly at 6:30 AM weekday mornings routinely waking me up.

 Another source of noise and vibration here comes from people's car radios and subwoofers operating in the parking lot. 
  
 In particular bass subwoofers mounted in the trunks of cars and that regularly blast, including at 6:30 AM, again waking me up.

 I'm a university degreed engineer, and I studied and know about what's known as ""structural resonances""

 These buildings are subject to low frequency structural resonances that get excited by any low frequency energy coming from the loud open exhaust systems of certain vehicles, as well as car radios and subwoofers. 

  These buildings seem efficient at coupling and being excited by low frequency energy....I feel like I'm living inside of a giant bass drum !!

 The structural engineers who designed these buildings, if there were any,  should be ashamed of themselves, in fact, this type of construction should not be permitted and allowed in the first place. 

 Now on the internal sources of noise within the building. 

 The walls are paper thin, and I can hear and in fact almost make out, what the people who live next door to me are saying on the other side of the wall.

 Also, some ""genius"" decided it was a great idea to put all the front doors of each apartment on these ridiculous spring loaded hinges.

 If you let go of the front door after opening it, the door violently slams shut, and it's worse the further the door is opened.

 I noticed and figured out after my first hour after moving in that the courteous thing to do is to try as much as possible catch the door before it slams shut. 

Of course nobody else in the apartments around me have figured this out and the constant sound of people letting their front doors slam shut on these spring loaded hinges is a regular occurrence.  

 I could have sworn I saw and felt the sink counter in my bathroom move maybe about 1/8"" and snap back after my neighbor let their front door slam one time from probably what was the full open position.      

 I don't know what else to say, I could mention the disgusting garbage situation with people constantly not adhering to trash valet protocols and leaving plastic bags of garbage, sometimes broken open, out in the hallways for days and not in the plastic tubs the garbage is supposed to be in.  

 I feel bad for the people in the front office who seem like they're just trying to make a living, and who try their best to accommodate the concerns of the residents.",2021-01-16 18:38:16,938,4914,

Our 2 servers (Barnabas was a dessert guru!) were impressively patient and knowledgeable about the menu and house items! The off menu house items are your traditional Italian fare and definitely worth a listen! Sandra and I split the sausage stuffed mushroom appetizer and it was the perfect start to our meal. We were also served toasted bread and a red pepper and olive oil dip with shaved parm- perfection! She had the house salad to start and  I selected the delicious Italian wedding soup (it was arguably the best soup I've had in a LONG time!). For our main entrees, I had the chicken piccata with homemade pasta and Sandra had the house special lasagna (with homemade ricotta and homemade lasagna noodles!). They were both superb! The homemade pasta elevated our dishes to the next level! To cap off the evening we both ordered the tiramisu and spumoni bomb! The dessert selection was definitely the most difficult choice I had to make all day!!! I can see coming here just for dessert, the selection is that impressive! Just kidding... I'd come just for the Italian Wedding soup! Or maybe to try their fresh made pizza from that stunning pizza oven. Nah, I need to try the lasagna next time!!!

Backstory: purchased a new to me MINI S from MINI of Tampa Bay after an accident in 2020 in the height of Covid lockdown, this Is my 3rd MINI. Within a short  time period or ownership, I had an issue and drove straight to Rennen (yellow light on, which ok to drive, but advised to have look at).

What happened:
This was so serious that I couldn't even put words to the experience until now, I could have been killed and killed others because of the condition my vehicle was in leaving Rennen for something that ended up being a relatively simple fix.
I was quoted thousands of dollars in repairs beyond the necessary repair -- They were  like YOUR CAR IS A MESS (which, their quote was TRIPLE what the dealership and another shop ended up quoting/costing). 
MINI offered to make right on the repair- I went to pickup my vehicle to take it to the dealer. 

The Rennen team knew I was headed to have repairs made elsewhere. 

I paid for this business for my car to basically go into shutoff mode while en route to another facility leaving  at 5pm on a weekday with every red light coming on my dash. 
Once again--I could have killed myself and others, thank god I wasn't on the bridge as I had planned- i detoured because I know the car wouldn't make it safely. 
I would have gladly towed it.

My necessary repair ended up being 400 dollars on top of what these guys didn't do for $120 in ""assessments"" (& days with my car) which in essence is peanuts compared to what I was quoted. I can't believe that I was allowed (and encouraged!) to drive the car away and this was allowed this in good conscience? 

I have expressed these sentiments to the owner when he reached out recently for booking an appointment & asked that they take this situation to heart moving forward.

*please also note, I had once visited Rennen with my 2nd MINI about a year ago & a few months prior to the 3rd MINI & most recent experience, they told me that there were also thousands of dollars of work needed on a car that had been serviced by warranty & extended warranty regularly at the dealership that had expired about 2 months prior.",2021-01-29 10:52:18,454,2204,

Okay, I might be overstating it just a smidge but their are a ton of Mexican restaurants. The four stars is based on the ""QMFCB"" or the Quality of Mexican Food Continuum in Bellevue. This is a separate scale just for the food genre.

Just north of I-40 at the corner of Charlotte Pike and Old Hickory rest, ""Mestizos"" First, the name? Unusual and exotic, right? One of the really pleasant people working here told me that it comes from Mexican history. When the Spanish conquered Mexico they often fell in love, got married and started a family. The children of these families were called ""mestizos"". I had never heard this story before but the artwork inside. I really like the interior. 

Onto the reason we are all here, the food. Good to high quality, varied and extensive menu. Traditional and the ranchero sauce was great. The salsa served with chips is clearly fresh and homemade.

I will be back. 

Given the COVID environment we were surprised how busy it was even with fewer tables the restaurant had a great vibe. It appeared there was only one server for the entire place. He was awesome. As a former food server it was amazing to watch him seat tables, greet tables, take drink orders, run the bar and run food. Whew! A little more patience is necessary from the patrons because of this circumstance. It was really good service given the circumstance.

n-BDLnUUw8NiJEtER5x3vg,eVpvD8jhYg537tLlsSgrCQ,kfRCbtTzDXrrBHZi9Wk-xw,1,0,0,0,"Leaf Filter Sales Review

We just had a visit by Leaf Filter sales.  Two gentlemen showed up, one of which was introduced as a ""trainee"".  After the usual pitch and discussion they showed me how the product is supposed to work.  Which it didn't when tested in the sink.  They grabbed a 2nd one and this one performed better.  It was blamed on the hard water in our house...  They then showed up ""awards"" they have received and the obligatory sales paraphernalia.  One thing they showed us was a printout from Consumer Reports that listed Leaf Filter as the #1 gutter guard in the ratings. (As a subscriber to CR I would later look for the same ratings and was unable to find them on the site and could not find a reference to them anywhere.)

Here is where it gets interesting.  I had done a bunch of research and I know that other professionals have stated this is a good product.  However, their pricing is over-the-top bad (I'll get to that in a minute).  I also saw way too many reviews stating that the product was not as good as advertised, promises made and not kept, and major hassles trying to get someone out from the company to fix improperly installed filters.  This was a red flag for us.  

Back to the sales guys... They measured our gutters (from Google Maps) and determined we have 54ft of gutters.  As we are in a townhouse, this is about right.  Part of their service included repairing current gutters, cleaning and sealing them.  This is standard, but they added in separating my gutters from my neighbors since we share them.  This makes sense and I was on board with that.  So they wrote up the initial quote for $2184 (taxes, fees, installation, etc. all included in that price).  That would make the product $40/ft!  Then he started taking the discounts.  He took 15% off because this was a slow time, then he took another 10% off for a military discount (we are not active or retired military, joked that we had family members that are, so he gave us the discount).  This brought everything down to $1670, which was now $31/ft.  Still unacceptable.  

Asked what bottom-line price was if we paid cash and was given a quote for $1503 ($28/ft.).  But that came with the stipulation that we had to decide right then and there.  This was not going to happen.  Asked him to give us until 6pm and we would let him know.  

I had watched a video of a guy stating that this is what LF does, start high and make it seem like they are giving you a great deal.  In the same video the gentleman stated that $12-$15 per foot is more along the lines of what you should be paying for a quality gutter guard.  I made a crack to the LF sales guys about car dealers and he laughed it off and actually stated that he doesn't work like that.  Um, I beg to differ...

After discussing we decided that we are not going to be pressured into a decision.  So I called the sales guy and stated that this isn't going to work and we are not ready to make a decision at this time.  And that the price was not where we want it to be.  He asked what price would be better and I stated that $800 would be more in line with what I was thinking ($15/ft.).  Next thing I know he asks me to hold on so he can call someone else (um, hello car sales going to manager?).  When he gets back on the line the price is now magically $779 ($14/ft.).  But again, needed to make a decision right there.  He added that at this new price he wasn't making any money (more car sales BS).  It was at this point we declined and said we didn't appreciate the high-pressure sales.  Couple that with the plethora of bad reviews and we were done.

So I cannot state how good or bad their product is, I can only state that their sales techniques are right on par with any car dealership.  If you are considering this product, that is fine.  Just know that you should be ready to make the decision right then and there to get the best price.  Make sure you are getting the price you are comfortable with.  Do the research, get other bids to get a general idea of what similar products will cost.",2021-01-05 13:43:01,877,4063,

It's in Midtown, and is relatively easy to get to off the main street, with ample parking nearby. It's near a few other unique shops and some light snacking, so it makes for a good place to pop into if you're walking through the area.

My first thought was that it is actually a smaller shop than I anticipated. However, there is such a fun, 80s vibe you are immediately presented with as soon as you walk in. I appreciate that they also offer you hand sanitizer (you have to sanitize before you fully go into the store).

Towards the front of Bad Apple Vntg was a few racks of clothing, and off to the left were shelves with fun pieces like bucket hats, bags, stationary and other planner-esque supplies, and even vintage Nintendo games. The back right of the store had shelves lined with candles, funky themed socks, and masks. The back left had fun cards and a display case of enamel pins and patches, while the front display case had some cute jewelry. The whole store was very clean and organized.

There was only one person working when I went, but they were very kind and patient as I perused their products. I had inquired about their online shop, and they told me that it wouldn't be operating for a while, as they were trying to focus on restocking their in person store. However, their social media presence has been pretty consistent, and you can see their store updates there. 

I think I will return in the future to buy some of the cute enamel pins they had on display, and check out any new items they may have gotten",2021-01-11 02:41:36,339,1635,

On January 02, 21 while watching TV they advertised a 2 for $4.00 breakfast sandwiches deal. Knowing how our McDonald's operates we jumped online to confirm the special. Upon arrival via drive-thru I ordered the two desired sandwiches. The young lady gave me a total of $7.50. I pulled up to the window and told her that we saw a commercial 2 for $4.00. She told me that the manager has not approved the special. I pulled up the special on my phone and she insisted that she was not going to honor that price!!! I asked to speak with the manager, and she tells me she's the manager!?!?!?! Puzzled she got another young lady involved because I pointed out that if she was a manager how could she not know about the special. So as we proceed the young lady actually told to call customer service. I called customer service and they told me that the manager can override it if she wanted to. So here I am holding up the line in drive-thru. At this point its not about the price its more about the principle. I told the young lady what customer service told me. She comented that she was going to honor the price, however since I called customer service she will not give me the special. She then slammed the window shut and came back with a white cordless phone and told me she was going to call the cops. I told her ill be parked on the side and she can call them while I call customer service back. As I was waiting I called customer service again, and they took down the complaint. So while I was parked and waiting for ""the police"" I told myself I was not going to start my New Years dealing with McDonald's. I decided I will order a nice bagel with cream cheese and lox with tomatoes, and onions for $7.00 @ Bordentown Bagels.

Please see pic below. It was $20, I've included the debit charge so you can see what I paid for the three items (one slice of cake, one cookie, one bar total $29.50). So nothing but truth here and that's what my review is about- my rating of my overall experience at your establishment, as it should be. 
Also want to point out I did not tell people not to go here anymore, just don't buy the cake slices because they are outrageously expensive and mediocre. I also review the taste of the items, as It's all relevant. 

Also Please understand I did say something at the moment, how do you think I learned it was $20! I didn't see a QR code, might have overlooked it But I did have the paper menu and there was the chalkboard menu (or whatever it was) and we also looked online later and none of those things mentioned the cost of the cake at that time that I could see. 

Your own response to the original review just confirms:
1. the cake slice is not prominently displayed 
2. That the cost is actually $15 (still ridiculous for slice of cake) which means I was also incorrectly charged for the item. 
3. That I was giving my patronage to your small business while we are in a pandemic 
4. I didn't demand a refund from your business (because we are in a pandemic and you are a small business). 

So if you are upset about my truthful review that warned people about a slice of cake (because again we are in a pandemic and people might not have $20 to spend on cake slice).
Acknowledge I might have been overcharged and not offer to look into it to correct it.
Not take into consideration to maybe just put the price somewhere people can easily see it irl.
But instead choose to just complain that I gave you this review in pandemic, WEEKS after I wrote it, then maybe you are really only confirming that you did deserve the rating you got from me for my experience with your business.",2021-01-15 18:10:40,406,1898,

I knew that Pastaria was the right choice. While it would have been great to dine inside, I am still not comfortable with it, so instead, we ordered carry-out. 

Placing the order was easy to do online and when I selected the day/time for pick-up, I received an email confirmation right away. When we arrived to pick up the order, we called inside and the gentleman working the curbside shift; found our car right away and delivered everything quickly. He made sure to let us know that the gelato was right on top. 

When we got home to eat, we decided to plate our meals instead of eating them from the to-go containers (which are really great for re-use). Our pasta was so good and I was glad to see that they even provided a few slices of their bread! We also ordered their risotto balls as an appetizer which were delicious. I ordered the Cacio e Pepe and was so impressed with how the noodles were cooked perfectly. Not too hard and not mushy either. The sauce and the pepper were just right and the amount of pasta was enough for a 2nd meal the next day! My husband ordered the Garganelli and said that the meat was tender and juicy and that the pasta noodles were also perfectly cooked with great flavors in the sauce. Overall, we both really enjoyed our meals and were still talking about it the next day. He was a little jealous that I saved some for lunch the next day so I got to enjoy it twice! 

The gelato was a great ending to the meal. Salted caramel gelato is a must try when visiting Pastaria. I recommend it. Actually, I would recommend any gelato flavor since they are all delicious! 

Thanks Pastaria for a great birthday dinner! I'll be back again soon and can't wait to dine inside or on your patio later this year!",2021-01-16 21:50:04,379,1852,

Up till now the service, food, and atmosphere has been awesome. During that time I have seen both good and bad employees go through the establishment the food has always been excellent except for one fish time. Tonight though, the kitchen staff proved that they could care less about the customers or the food. When we first came in we seen an older couple has just placed their orders and the cook screamed he wasn't going to cook that with a great deal of profanities. Customers were complaining about the loud curse words and several tables complained about not getting all their orders and all we could hear was more profanity from the kitchen.

 The next issue of the night was apparently first come first serve is not honored here. I placed an order for a pork steak sandwich and the waitress went to find out if there was any left, which I was fine with. When she asked the cook about it there was more profanity and then the waitress at the counter turned around and sold the last one to someone who literally just walked in after we had been there for a little bit. After that, I ordered the ribeye sandwich and request the sautéed onions be diced a little bit even if it is just hitting it with a spatula. The waitress replied with ""I will try"" and we heard the cook cursing her for the request all the way back to our table and he refused to do it. This type of thing continued and delayed our orders and other customers order because of the temper tantrum being thrown in the kitchen. Next as we were finishing our meal, a new server came in and was complaining loudly from the register that she did not like one of the girls she was working with.

 In all the times I have been here before, there has never been a visit as crazy as this. I would like to say that our server bless her tried her best to give excellent service even with everything that was happening.  Also the steak sandwich was excellent. I will give this place another chance due to the fact that I enjoy the food; however, if the atmosphere created by some of the employees continue in the future I will not return and find another good steak sandwich at a competitor.",2021-01-04 06:44:55,441,2210,

True story: my friend texted me about MŌR Doughnuts while I was out camping in the desert, I ran around and finally found enough signal to place a preorder to pick up on Christmas. Best decision ever.

Spending this Christmas alone due to covid, I wanted some cheer! These mochi doughnuts brought cheer and so much more. Tommy, the owner, is the sweetest person ever and after chatting for a bit, he really did brighten up an otherwise sad day. You can tell he is genuinely just a caring person, who deeply cares about his customers! He even offered to deliver the doughnuts to me because I was running late on pick up!

I tried the mango, ferrero rocher, matcha, churro, and strawberry sprinkle doughnuts. Tommy was giving away free strawberry doughnuts to kids that day, but dropped in one for my kid at heart :) 

All doughnuts were incredible. My favorite was mango and matcha! I absolutely love the chewy texture of the mochi and can't wait to try other flavors (and past ones I missed) as they drop. Is eating four mochi doughnuts a week bad for me? *shrugs*

Some logistics to know:
- weekly preorders announced on @mordoughnuts on Instagram (typically 12pm on Thursdays)
- $12/box of four doughnuts
- sometimes rotating flavors as Tommy comes up with more delicious ones!
- pick up downtown on Fridays and Saturdays between 10am-1pm
- order online, pay by card, choose pick up day

I understand that restaurants are busy on New Year's Eve, however the point of a reservation is to make sure your customers aren't standing outside 55 min past their set time. It is kind of contradicting that they take your card so they can bill you if you are late but they did not even have the courtesy to call you to let us know they were running behind. Once inside the manager promised to make it up to us but never even came to check on our table. We also called in advance to let them know we had a vegetarian guest coming with us and they said they would accommodate to her. She received a plate full of raw vegetables in replace of the normal options (filet steak or grouper). Not to mention the lack of any type of seasoning (not even salt or pepper) on the vegetables. I had ordered the filet for my main course. They ask how you would like it cooked and I said medium. They proceeded to give me 2 raw filets and then I asked for them to just put the 2nd filet back on for a second and then it was brought out burnt. ( I would have eaten it well done but it was to a crisp). At this point we were done and wanted to leave and the check still came out to almost $800. (So nothing was taken ""care of"" like the manger had promised). All in all food was good when they put effort in. At some point management needs to do their job and accommodate.

We finally tried it last night.  I'm going to say this is the best Italian restaurant we've been to in Florida since moving here from Long Island 12 years ago.  We used to take incredible Italian food for granted until moving down here.  Okay, so you walk in and the incredible smell of a proper Italian restaurant hits you immediately.  Then you look around, and the place is really nice.  It's a lovely warm cozy setting to have a meal.  We had a party of 7 and they sat us at this beautiful round table with a huge umbrella over it lit up with little lights.  It created a great ambiance. Our waiter Matt took great care of us.   None of our special requests were any trouble and we had quite a few.  The menu has so many great sounding things on it, it's hard to decide.  The specials were great as well.  My husband and I are gluten free and they had a whole separate menu for us which was a first.  I was actually able to order something breaded in a restaurant! Matt also brought us our own basket of gluten free garlic bread at no charge.   Unheard of.  You gluten free people know what I'm talking about.   So I ordered a veal chop Milanese (because I COULD!).  And the steamed clams in butter and garlic wine sauce (which I was able to fully enjoy with my gluten free bread to dip in it!)  my husband got the beef carpaccio and the lamb chops.  The carpaccio was a gorgeous plate with lots of fresh Parmesan slices to accompany it.  Everyone at the table was impressed by this plate.  The lamb chops were delicious and they gave him 6 of them! That's quite a generous portion compared to anywhere else we've ordered them.   Suffice to say everyone loved their food.  I have some pictures for you.  They even presented our birthday girl with a complimentary tartufo dessert.  Matt was an exceptional waiter in every way, wrapping our leftovers and presenting them in nice bags, taking our photos, knowing in detail everything about the food on the menu, suggesting the right wine to make 3 different people who were sharing it happy.

The property is a solid 2 star motel, but I dropped it down to a 1 star for their false listing of their best room as the ""Presidential Suite""...there is nothing Presidential or luxurious about this very old room with horrible decor. We paid extra for the BEST room this Double Tree by Hilton owned property had to offer and we were given a dump. 

The ICE car air freshners in the vents are surely Presidential and high class. The cracked paint, water leaking toilets, entrance doors with 1"" gaps open to the world, the broken remotes, chairs with no padding, and broken refrigerator are surely all Presidential upgrades as well...

Had we not booked this room through Hotels.com we would have demanded a refund the minute we walked into this very old and broken down suite and went elsewhere. 

Pros:
-Quiet and peaceful 
-Large open areas would be good for a large family
-Staff is friendly 
-Nightly security guard in parking lot
-Pool open and heated

Cons:
-A/C and/or Heat is ran by a master system and you can only choose a range of 68-72 as your temperature in the room
-Walls, Furniture, Decor is very old and warn out
-No shuttle to the Casino as advertised
-Advertised 2 living rooms and a total of 3 forty inch TV's actually had 1 living room and 1 dinning room and only 2 TV's total
-Bed is bouncy, creeky, and from the 90's
-TV remotes broken with no battery cover and buttons very hard to push on both TV's
-Advertised premium cable channels but could not find many channel ti choose from on either TV and they had no guide to view availability
-Both toilets leak water from the bottom seal and get your feet/socks wet
-One of the fridges was broken and had red mold
-The fans in both rooms are loud and clanky when they turn on
-Paint chipping and falling off
-Dusty and cob webs in almost all corners 
-Dining table had sticky stuff all over it
-No large trash anywhere 
-Lighting in room is very minimal

Not a totally horrible place to spend a night if need be, but definitely no luxury or suites here worth the extra money.

I came for breakfast want to show my support for the #CareyKStrong movement in my new neighborhood. In my opinion, breakfast is one of the hardest meals to screw-up, but Joe K's managed to do it.

I love a hearty breakfast. Having a big breakfast, I can usually skip lunch and have an early dinner. The morning of my visit, I ordered the, Hungry Man Breakfast . I had my choice of meats, I choose, bacon. It came with two eggs, I had mine fried hard with the yolks broken. For my potatoes, I requested my Hash Browns be done extra crispy and instead of toast, I paid the uncharge for $ sized pancakes. 

Positives of the entree; the pancakes were full sized, not what a city man would call $ sized and they were fluffy and good flavor. My eggs were also done as I requested and none of the food was overly seasoned with salt or pepper. Also, the coffee was very good and the servers made sure my cup was always full. 

The negatives are, cold, chewy and twisted bacon. I mean, ice cold. I know a lot of diners prepare bacon in advance to make things easier and faster, but this bacon tasted as if it were from the day before. My Hash Browns were not extra crispy, they were not even semi crisp. They too, were cold like the potatoes you'd get on a buffet line. 

The service was attentive and they were all wearing masking. The tables were spaced for social distancing, but they did not skip booths, so those dining in a booth were right next to each other. 

I'll give them another try, because I've heard the lunches are very good. I not only want to support a local diner, but I want to support the #CareyKStrong fundraiser as well.

For the most part it was good (phone, internet & cable).  However over the years it started getting more costly to the point where I started feeling like I was paying a mini mortgage to have the 3 things bundled together.  About 4-1/2 years or so ago I dumped their cable due to skyrocketing costs for even the smallest package.  I got a great price for internet & landline but after 3 years it went up $30 & things haven't been the same.  Calling & going into their store to see if I could get a better price for being such a longtime loyal customer fell on deaf ears. I continued chugging along with Comcast for internet & landline, I would say for shits & giggles but it was only because the alternatives was worse then them (can you imagine?).  I also noticed that over the last 3 years the internet as well as the landline has been down more then working.

Things really changed at midnight on 09/23/2020. I was still wide awake (Why? I haven't the foggiest idea.) and I notice that my streaming service, YouTube TV, was doing the old sit & spin so I checked my phone & low & behold the WiFi on my phone was doing the same thing.  Then I check the landline & gee no service at all so I put my cell phone on LTE & went online to see if there was an outage & there was.  It said it was a scheduled outage from midnight until 6am. This was news to me, I thought they would inform their customers when they schedule such things no matter what time of the day it was to happen. And since that day I kid you not my internet & landline are down more than ever before.   

I've been continuously checking the ""new guys"" in town as they were starting to offer fiber optics and towards the later part of 2020 they finally were in my neighborhood. And thanks to this other company I now will be saving roughly $60 a month for both landline & fiber optic internet.  I'm so glad this alternative is finally here (it's not in my entire town but it's slowly rolling out)  as it's more reliable and faster than Comcast, no one else in the neighborhood is using my dedicated fiber optic line, and the customer service is fantastic. Oh and did I mention it's a local company?  Local is the name of the game.

And today I was finally able to say goodbye to Comcast completely.  When I called in to cancel I spoke to Leon who was very friendly and great.  When I said I had another service already working for me he said ""so I guess I can't entice you to stay with us since you've been a customer for an extremely long time?""  No Leon, you can't.  He didn't try to press me to stay with Comcast which I appreciated, he said he cancelled my service & said to drop off the equipment at either the local store or the UPS store but to make sure to get a receipt, which I did.  I explain that unfortunately I had an issue with the solar company who installed my solar....I tried to get them to change the inverters to start utilizing my new internet company but they filed bankruptcy with no notification to their customers and all emails bounced back & all phone numbers were ""disconnected or no longer in service.""  Finally got some help from the inverter company, did all the changing myself which is why it took so long to cancel my service with Comcast.  

So today it's goodbye Comcast, hello local company with faster internet & better landline as well as awesome customer service!  My advice is if you're having issues with Comcast try to find a more reliable service as I did so you too can give them the boot.",2021-01-31 03:58:23,753,3593,

Apps were fine and served fairly quickly. Dinner orders were taken. I asked for corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas and was told they couldn't make that change. Fine, I asked for corn tortillas on the side and turned my quesadilla into tacos on my own. It was supposed to be duck and mango - I couldn't find a single piece of mango in the dish. The frijoles, a staple food in a Mexican restaurant, were inedible as they were overly salty. In addition, tables were not, in my opinion, spaced far enough apart. The table behind me was only about 4' away and, when leaving we walked between two sets of table in an aisle a wheelchair would not have fit through, so nowhere near 6' apart. The last two things: our waitress asked if we wanted anything else with coffee - as far as I can tell, they don't serve dessert, so we thought that was an odd question. We also asked for tea which apparently they don't serve. We did ask if we could have hot water as I always carry decaf teabags as many restaurants don't have decaf tea. We were told they didn't have hot water. Huh? Put a pot on the stove. Heat a cup in the microwave. It's not rocket science. We were served two cups of barely tepid water. Finally, without asking and WITHOUT TELLING us, they added a 25% tip to the check. I had seen on their website that they were adding 28%. They never gave us an itemized bill to look at, just a total amount. Apparently people had balked at that, but truly, service and food did not earn a 25% tips. Dinner for 8, with their 25% tip included came to over $550, outrageous for mediocre Mexican food. Needless to say, we were upset about that -- not rushing back again. Just a note: Plaza Azteca, a chain restaurant, has better food and that same bill would have come to about $275 with a decent 20-22% tip which is what our family normally chooses.

NOTE: Just got home and found out they billed for Bombay Sapphire instead of a back bar gin, in the gin and tonic, and charged $16, again, without asking. More importantly, Bombay Sapphire always gives a drink a blue hue - this gin and tonic was as clear as plain tonic and for that matter, had very little gin in it. Clearly, they not only overcharged for the drink, but I think that although they charged for Sapphire, they actually used their bar gin,  overcharging  about $4, but add the 25% for the automatic tim and they just got an extra $5 out of our party.",2021-01-31 01:35:10,573,2615,

Our server was an angel and she really was the star of the show. From her witty and friendly banter to her superb service and suggestions. She alone deserves like a million stars. (Once I find out her name I'll make sure to edit my review!)

She really does embody the spirit of New Orleans and the dining experience one dreams of whether you're a local or a tourist. I also have to mention her swag was just so badass, like the cool kid who is just so cool and gets along with everyone and makes friends with anyone. My partner and I were so blown away by her that we didn't hesitate to leave a generous tip and personally thank her for making our date night so memorable. 

Anyways... Dining in the midst of a pandemic can be quite tricky but if you're concerned about the practices here. DON'T BE. Blue Giant has knocked it out of the park with all of their COVID-19 safety practices. Honestly this was one of the safest dining experiences I have ever had. They have a total of five tables open so reservations are an absolute must. Installation of plexiglass, check-in station at the front, masks required, hand sanitizer, constant sanitizing, I felt like a true VIP.

When one is on a date night, you know you have to start off with some cocktails if that's your poison. Their signature cocktails are worth trying and one of them even benefits the Son of a Saint non-profit!

Now for our first bites of the evening, I don't play around nor do I try to look cute in front of my partner anymore. I'm ordering the whole damn menu and I'm going to create a spread that should be for four people not just two.

My boyfriend and I started with an egg drop soup, dan dan noodles, shrimp wontons, and another item that my boyfriend wanted.

Holy crap those dan dan noodles. Have you ever had a bit of food that is so good you contemplate saying it taste horrible so you don't have to share. Well I sure as hell did, because I would've gladly ate this dish all alone or even reheated in the middle of the night while he was asleep. Every bite had the right balance of crunch and texture, my taste buds were really having a trip of their lifetime.

The spicy chili crunch on the shrimp wontons is fire (but not super spicy at all)! You have to order this dish and share amongst the table, it's a great dish and as you start exploring the menu you really do realize that this will be a signature dining experience within the city.

We hadn't even ordered our ""main dishes"" and I was already crying tears of joy with my third glass of wine. (Oh yea, they also serve beer and wine!)

I was intrigued about the crispy beef being a dine-in only dish, so I wanted to take full advantage of the opportunity. I'm one who stalks a menu for like the whole day and scouring through countless amount of photos so I know ahead of time and make ""casual suggestions"" whenever I'm dining out. 

*I'm putting my [food] stalking skills for the greater good I keep telling myself.

So when the dish comes out, I made sure to let my boyfriend have the first few bites. Balance, y'all balance. So when his eyes lit up, I was like hot damn this is gonna be a treat. So I use my chopsticks and pick up a bite and put it into my mouth. 

Chefs Kiss.

I was ready to go behind the kitchen and just hug the kitchen. I can't give proper justice to this dish; however, I can see that the reason it's not available for to-go/takeout is because I understand it wouldn't give proper justice to this dish. It has to absolutely be served straight from the kitchen.

Now the surprise winner of the night for me was the char siu pork. So f*ck#ng tender and literally would break apart from the touch of the chopstick. It was so good that I ate a second dish of it alone. My mouth is actually drooling while I'm typing this out haha.

Blue Giant is just such a romantic and hella cute spot. I'm so happy to see them around and thankful I was able to dine-in and support them.",2021-01-31 23:16:29,877,4082,
AkzrixmIA4Yu1nEKbdaFcA,wXdbkFZsfDR7utJvbWElyA,J8TdbZAjorONUSefJDvBjA,4,9,1,3,"For fans of the distillery side of the Quaff on/Big Woods business, it is nice to see this expansion of the ultra cool Hard Truth Hills in Nashville, IN have a place to distribute both the liquors produced as well as the brewery items from the same location downtown.  Since our state is not very good at making the alcohol industry beneficial to the companies that make beer, wine, or liquor.  Archaic Rules, some dating back as far as Prohiition, impede the progress of new businesses.  In this case, customers can get tastes of beer, or liquor, but they can't get anything to go!  They have to get a special license to be able to sell bottles of liquor to customers who would prefer to drink in the comfort and safety of their home, instead of drinking on site and then calling for a ride.   I have several bottles of the Hard Truth liquors that I find quite good (from the main campus in Nashville, IN).  However, after sampling a taste of one of their newer products, I was unable to make  purchase to take home until their license comes through.  I thought we were supposed to be a ""pro business"" state, but you can hardly tell by all the red tape out puritanical ""leaders"" haven't bothered to address.  Not like businesses have had it tough the past year on their own, but when an existing business has already been licensed elsewhere in the state, it seems ridiculous to tie things up requiring more licenses.  Oh, well, I guess I will have to head to Nashville to pick up the new flavor.  

 Other than the inconvenience of not being able to make a carryout purchase yet, I will say that the gentleman behind the bar was very courteous and helpful.  The beer I tasted  was also quite good.  If you have patience, you can wait until the paperwork comes through for carry out sales.  But if you are able to enjoy a beverage on site, they do have plenty of beer and an impressive list of cocktails using locally produce liquor.

Although they don't have food on their own, there are plenty of vendors set up in the neighboring stalls of the Garage Food Hall.

oKkJ4tNae4hGkRK8Gtc9qA,6jjHo9Lilv3kTy87pm2ycw,RIC1oJfgzVcnT-RGpFnC6A,4,63,28,53,"Very close to I-75 on Hwy 54, this restaurant has been open approximately one week. (I wish previous reviewers would have taken that into consideration.) Currently, it does not accept phone orders, online orders, & it's not yet set up for Uber Eats, but all three options WILL soon be available.

I debated hard between 3 & 4 stars before deciding to be a little generous. King of the Coop just recently opened, & as w/ any new business it requires time to train service staff & cooks, & work out all the kinks. I will return in a month or so to reevaluate the service & to try additional foods. My food today was VERY GOOD. (I am still debating how I should feel about the two young kitchen guys/cooks who were not wearing a cap or hair net.)

My visit today could have gone much better. I about lost feeling in my lips & tongue for ten minutes because my ""mild"" chicken was prepared incorrectly. It was hot, & the only thing I like hot is men. Lol. (Such an opportunistic & bad joke:) Seriously, an ordering/ preparation error brought me considerable discomfort. 

Do bring a credit or debit card! This is an establishment that will NOT take cash; however, it will take plastic. There is a sign on the front door (declaring ""card only"") as you enter & one hanging from the counter where you'll order; at least the policy is clearly stated & visible. 

The menu is overhead on the wall above the counter where you'll order-- see pic. For some reason, this eatery has just 1 register (yet it had five young women gathered together at the counter in very close proximity to each other-- made no sense, especially if management is supposedly worried about Covid.) 

From the counter, customers can see into the kitchen. Once each diner orders & pays, the cashier requests a first name & a phone number. You'll receive a text when your food has been prepared--  then proceed to the counter once you hear your name called. 

Each entrees is packaged in a brown cardboard box EVEN if you're dining in. (There are 5 metal tables that hold 6 diners each.) All beverages are served in pre-packaged #2 recyclable plastic bottles. 

I ordered the Chicken & Waffles @ $9.99 & an unsweetened iced tea. (See pics.) I told the young cashier, ""I want mild, definitely not hot."" But I added that I wanted it to have ""some flavor-- a little kick. Just a little."" What I received was not mild. I later learned that it was labeled ""Midway,"" but it was not even ""Midway."" It was HOT-- so HOT my lips & tongue burned for 10 min. (I don't tolerate hot spices.) The manager took my box from me, & after a few minutes returned w/ a new one (& repeated apologies). 

The replacement chicken was perfect (VERY flavorful-- see pic) & the waffles were delicious. However, they both were difficult to eat since I had to eat directly from the box. I couldn't even place the chicken on top of the waffles-- bummer. Why paper/plastic plates aren't offered is beyond me. However, plastic utensils & napkins are available. There is also a napkin dispenser on each table. 

Too many hungry diners had to wait in line inside (close together) because this eatery has JUST ONE register on the counter. Just one! It made zero sense for the four young woman to stand beside & behind the cashier taking orders; they had nothing to do. Hopefully, an additional register (or two) are on the way! The manager spent his time working hard in the kitchen, so obviously this new business is not yet at 100% efficiency. 

Bottom Line: The Chicken & Waffles entree really was VERY GOOD once the spicy chicken was replaced w/ the mild version. The restaurant's interior appeared clean. King of the Coop is not an upscale place & it definitely lacks the character of the Tampa location, but it will likely become a worthy addition to the growing Wesley Chappel area.",2021-01-24 01:07:40,816,3814,

Firstly the ""man"" who presented/sold the program at a hotel seminar was super high Pressure and quite dishonest about the program. Finding out he works on commission explained a lot. How do I know what kind of money he makes? He had a sexual relationship with a friend of mine... who by the way he also tried to hook into DLSI (unsuccessfully). After he couldn't sell her on a program he did use his ""charm"", charisma, and salesmanship to get her into bed. Two antibiotics a STD and zero return phone calls later I'd say she still got the better deal! I paid 10K plus and expressed extreme difficulty in learning from the instructors to DLSI. I have a hearing impairment and there is zero closed captioning, illegible white board writing and a huuuuuge  language barrier!!! All of their ""professors"" aka test prep tutors were from other countries. I literally could not understand a WORD of my A&P teachers ""lectures"" and complained to the school. They said to get used to it because as a RN I'd have to learn to understand ""foreigners"" to be successful. They don't tell you that in addition to that 10K plus ""tutoring"" for excelsior's nursing program you have to pay to test out of EVERY course. That's another 400$ a test to the tune of 12 tests and then another SEVERAL thousand to go to a ""clinical site"" to obtain the hours needed to ""test out"" of skills to be able to sit for ""state boards"" problem is that state licensure isn't recognized by MOST states! That means you can't just take the NCLEX exam pass and then apply for reciprocity like I could  if I took an ACCREDITED program in Ohio then decided to move to Iowa. Good luck working as a RN after paying 15k plus for a piece of paper that isn't worth the pulp it took to make it. Sooooo let's say you complete their A&P and their Psych and their fundamentals class but you want to go to another school.... nope!!!! Still on the hook for a program you no longer want AND even if you do just pay them off and decide to go elsewhere you have to pay for those classes again... because you can't transfer credits from a non-accredited ""school"" that is really just test prep. These people are dishonest and they work as a pyramid scheme. Basically you get money off your ""tuition"" for every person you get to sign up. Ughhhh. And if you recruit X number of people your program is FREE (if you don't count books, uniforms for ""clinical"" and the 6K in testing). They brag about a 97% passage rate.... statistics lie!!!! I was in a high pressure sales pitch with 20 plus other men and women 12 of us signed right then and there for a ""discount"" (more like so we wouldn't have time to do our due diligence) NONE of us completed the program or were able to sit for the NCLEX. We exchanged information to ""study"" together. Run!!!!! If something sounds too good to be true it probably is!!!! I stupidly tried calling them 3 times this year to try to go back through the ""test prep"" since I already paid for it and was off during the pandemic. I can't get an email or call back. I recently filed another complaint with the better business bureau and I'm hoping it at the very least helps others who also have been swindled and helps people avoid the same trap I fell into!",2021-01-02 03:54:30,713,3262,

I will start by saying that this restaurant is absolutely beautiful and has a fantastic atmosphere. They did a nice job with offering ""lap blankets"" and having heaters to minimize the cold, such a nice touch!! Our server was very nice and pleasant. 
For the Holiday, they offered a 5 course menu, at $115 a person. From a value perspective, this is a bit high... but neither of us mind that when the experience and food is great. I'm disappointed to say that this was not the case, sadly. We began with ordering a Martini... which was one of the worst he has ever had. We opted for a bottle of wine, which was great and at $62 for the bottle, vs $22 a glass.. was a no brainer.
There were two options for each course, so we ordered one of each. The oysters weren't bad. The tuna, which is always a favorite... was ok. Bland but just ok. The asparagus salad was good, had nice flavor, but was very small.. maybe a few bites. The soup was cold and bland. Duck liver, which I personally would never normally order, was very unappetizing. The beet terrine was also not good. The remainder of our meal, were served less than room temperature, pretty much cold. The filet and sea bass could have been good, had they been even warm. The pana cotta was yummy and a much welcomed finish to a very ""catering hall"" feeling meal. 
Also, we were seated by the service area, which was hidden with beautiful drapes... but insanely noisy and really changed the vibe from a lovely intimate setting, to feeling as if we were sitting in the kitchen. 
Overall, we had a great time as always, however this dinner was extremely disappointing and surprisingly not great as far as the food. I love so many Garces restaurants and had high hopes for this one!

rba6RhDF8MZhmzUtF5tcYA,wYPa1GSvSuvXIrOU5LkWAA,jrwn0tKRGlQgZrnZutESwQ,2,4,0,0,"I believe the first handyman skill should be is drywall repair. This is one skill set  I am not good at and I thought calling a handyman service could repair 2 ceiling holes (4 x 4) and a drywall seam that was showing  were fairly simple. Patch and texture.

First, he talked way too much......1/2 the repair bill was him talking and doing no repair. Then he charged me $24.60  for materials and $177.00 for labor.   WTF... 2 pieces of 1 x 1 drywall and joint compound. OK... I can kind of  get over that. 

The repairs looked OK because the joint compound and texture was still wet, but the next morning when everything was dry...it was awful. One repair, the repair had a big crack and also you could see the seams and screw holes because he used a piece of drywall that was ""thinner"" than the original and filled it in with joint compound. This is what he told me. The second repair you, could see the seams and screw holes. I think he used the right ""thickness"" of drywall, but not really sure.

The ""handyman's"" skill for medium  knockdown texture sucks. He could not remotely get close to the basic ""knockdown"" texture. He used a sponge???...No one with basic drywall skills uses a sponge for medium knockdown texture. 

I did call and and email about the crappy repair. The same tech came out and tried to repair and retexture the previous repair. It's OK, but still not what I CONSIDER A GOOD DRYWALL REPAIR. 

Eventually, I went over all the second visit repairs and re-applied joint compound, resanded and retextured everything the ""handyman"" was supposed to do originally.

For $201.64, I could have done a better job repairing 2 ceiling holes and a wall seam.

I am sure they are a good handyman service company, but they are as good as the employees they hire. 

I will also be emailing the owner of this company a more detailed  description of what transpired when the ""handyman"" visited my house.

Next time, I will hire a drywall guy that hangs, tapes and textures sheetrock. It will avoid the frustration.

I used this company for multiple projects in the past, and chose to use them again about a year ago. Much to my surprise, the product and customer service has completely dissipated. Completely.

I had chosen a product from their catalog that was represented as being very ""sleek"" and beautiful. Once the project was completed, it turned out to resemble a cheaply made plastic insert.  

During install, my window was cracked, and I promptly mentioned this, however, my complaint was ignored. There have been multiple issues that I have had with this product, and I've had to subject my household to repeat returns of strangers into my house during a pandemic, in an effort to correct the problems. 

Eventually, I asked for a partial refund in order to rip the entire thing out and have it completed by another company in the area. On a Friday, Monica, at corporate, informed me that they would refund me $450.00 on my $5,000.00 purchase. Then, within 4 days, retracted that offer and said that the ""team"" had changed their minds and would offer no refund.

Today, they sent a gentleman to my home to ""discuss with me the replacement of the product"". He took photos and left. I felt as though it was a ""cya"" tactic and had relatively nothing to do with actually correcting the situation at hand. 

I understand that to them, this may be a quality product, and that their workmanship is unmatched. However, as a repeat ""flipper"", I would attest to the fact that this product and workmanship are of the worst I have seen.

On the positives: really clean restaurant, nice waitress who was also the hostess. This place definitely is following the covid guidelines. The tables are spaced apart enough, they clean and sanitize each table thoroughly and the waitress was even wearing gloves! My beef noodle soup called Tew Neua Toon dish was amazing! Flavorful broth, big chunks of beef, delicious Chinese broccoli! I would love to eat this everyday! 

The negatives: the marinated pork (Namtok Moo) and the ground pork with rice dish. The appetizer we got which was the Namtok Moo was very salty and the sauce tasted artificial. It tasted like one of those pre-made Asian sauces you can buy in the international aisle in the supermarket. The pork was also very chewy and rubbery. The Ka Prow  was a ground pork stir fried with Thai basil sauce, onion and fried egg. The meat was again, way too salty and had an overwhelming taste of spice. It was just too much for me. I don't know if they used msg but it tasted a bit too strong.

Definitely make reservations if you have yet to experience the surreal, cozy joy that is heat lamp dining in the freezing cold on a city street (for the record, we were adequately TOASTY here, so much so I didn't wear my winter coat or scarf the entire meal and wished I didn't wear a sweater either). Get on down here!

Our server, Paul, was THE best.  Insanely knowledgable about the expansive wine list and the best pairings for each section of the menu, pacing our courses with calculated precision.  Plus, super friendly and attentive (especially considering servers have to cross the street in traffic to deliver our food!)

A breakdown:

The Sauce: started with two glasses of white, then moved on to a bottle of red (a lovely licorice-y bottle of Barbera, per Paul's recommendation)

The Starter: addicting, toasty & not shy of seasoning foccacia bread served piping hot in a mini cast iron skillet and served with delightful whipped bee pollen honey butter (can you eat this if you're allergic to bees, serious question) & an addition of silky farmer's cheese (I would literally go back just to order 5 these - bread lovers, REJOICE!)

The Small Plate: lovely, bitter chicory with a smattering of pistachios and a hefty dousing of a fresh and herby rose vinaigrette, topped with plump figs (very large portion for being labelled ""small"")

The Shareable Pastas: creamy duck ragu gramigna and lemony saffron calamaretti (that gamey duck won the battle, especially paired with the red, but that calamaretti was also fantastic)

The Sizable Entrees: peppery NY strip steak and a decadent roast suckling pig (wonderful crust on the steak but a *tiny* complaint is that the steak knives were not sharp at all, and that pig was 1000% worth the high cholesterol)

The Sweet(s): fried apple donut and a butterscotch gelato served with all the fixins' (this was 2desserts and we did not need 2desserts - it was excessive but worth every delicious bite)

It feels like you're in a fort, with a tall heat lamp and two smaller heat lamps ensconcing you in a warm, orange glow.

Not any paper menus that they can throw out just there plain regular menus, but they could still get wiped down. Anyways the server was great to start with. Once we sat down he immediately asked us what we wanted to drink (Which I would of given people like two or three minutes to look and see the drinks). After he came back with the drinks he took our orders. 

Then got the food out fast. Once we finished eating he came over a few minutes later and said is there anything else I can get you? We told him no that's it. 99% of the time we are out and say that we get our bill. He just left and went to do other things. 

There were two people running the floor as far as I can see. So it was an older man and then this man that was about the same age as my boyfriend and me and were. So he had to be between 18-30. Then I see he take the next customers which was a family. He seats them.

Takes there drink order and then goes away and we are still waiting for our check this whole time! Comes back with their drinks and takes there order.

Comes back in a few minutes to take the check and money and says be right back with change. 

I watch him as he is doing something else and not giving us the change then I look away and he's back with the change. We left after that because we were done. We were also annoyed because my boyfriend had work at 3pm and we wanted to hang out a little more and go to target before he had to leave to get home to get ready for work which we got there at 12:30pm. By the time we said no that's it, it was 1:03pm. When he gave us the check and we got the change it was 1:15-1:16pm. 

That's when I was keeping count my boyfriend apparently was keeping count longer and said it was about half an hour we were waiting (Which I don't think so), but in all it was slow as snails. They need to pay more attention please they really were not that busy at all!",2021-01-23 04:34:09,460,2063,

My girlfriend and I were actually the very first customers to sit and eat at the restaurant. We had been driving by since they were doing renovations and finally decided to stop by when we saw it looked open. They sat us even though they weren't quite ready for dine in and the service was amazing. The owners took care of us, explained the menu and their backstory. They were extremely warm and inviting, even asking us to help name a new signature Sushi Role. Beyond that, the food was fantastic. We were served the complimentary rice chip appetizer and edamame to start, both were great. The complimentary chips are a nice touch. We split a house salad, which was unique and delicious. Finally, we got our main courses, 2 sushi roles and teriyaki chicken. The sushi was out of this world. Often sushi is generally the same at most places, but here it was fresh, with a unique flavor. I can't recommend surf and turf role enough, the seared beef on top was Fantastic. The dragon role was also delicious. And the chicken on the teriyaki plate was tender and flavorful. At the end of the meal, they also brought us a complimentary dessert, some type of home made ice cream sandwich. Wow! It was fanatic, right down to the home made whip cream.

In all, I am so glad to see this place turn into something even better than the old hooks. This will now be in our rotation of local spots. The owners said they will also be adding ramen to the menu, which you can't find in this direct area. Can't wait!

If you've driven past and thought about stopping, do yourself a favor and stop in! We can't recommend this place enough.",2021-01-03 22:42:05,348,1650,

I was always blessed to live with my dad or roommates who did the regular check ups. Then my husband fully took over the responsibility as well as doing minor repairs and fixes that still are costly taking it to a someone else to fix. 

After my husband passed away I had to depend fully on my father for several years. I bought a few bad used disasters! I've paid a sad amount to keep metal together to move on wheels in recent years. My husband always took our vehicles to a close family friend to his family. Once I had to rely on my dad, for my lack of knowledge or even simple ability to maintain a working vehicle, he started bringing me to his mechanic shop that he had been going to for decades along with friends of his. This is a staple mom and pop type shop. The owner(s) from what I've experienced are incredibly nice, genuine, upfront, and honest. My dad handled all the drop off and communication but I do know that they have been extremely reasonable with prices, the owner had once told me to come to him with a vehicle before buying another piece of junk, and when my dad told them they were moving out of town the owner told him that they would take care of me and help me. 

This is a very NON bias review as I don't know anymore than the transactions made through my dad and the company. I have been there many times for pick up and have interacted minimally but have been extremely pleased. I'm living a bit of a distance away but plan to go out of the way on my day off next week to make an appointment with them on my vehicle. I felt compelled to write this review cause there were less than a handful and nothing recent. I've decided to make this mechanic shop a forever help and not because of my dad but because they extended their willingness to help me out as a longtime loyal customer on my dads behalf. They are quick to fix and very trustworthy. The one downside is that they don't do transmission work. Another situation I got into. They do have a company in Clearwater that they send their business that way. Another positive, the company is pretty honest as well. They didn't fix my transmission because they found more issues on my vehicle and felt like I should consider the cost not worth fixing the transmission. Unfortunately I can't recall the name of that company at this given moment but they saved me a few thousand! I would highly recommend this mechanic shop and hope that they continue to stay open for decades to come to save me from killing my vehicles off!",2021-01-14 04:52:19,538,2634,

I came here on a Sunday because I had such a craving for a spicy Bloody Mary. I checked the menu out on line beforehand and saw they had what they called The Crabby Mary. Sounded good.
As we pulled up, we didn't have any problems finding a parking spot. We walked right in and out to the outdoor bar area and sat down. Our bartender greeted us and right away, and before she could introduce herself, I ordered their Crabby Mary. Now, one thing I was kind of iffy on, was that they put lump crab meat in their Bloody Mary. 
Now, when I got this, it looked so good. It literally failed all of my expectations. They should definitely NOT put crab meat in their drink. This was really gross and made the drink even taste weird. The last thing I want to do is suck up a bunch of crab meat in my straw. Ewe. So, needless to say, I would never order this special drink of theirs again. 
Onto the food. We had the Ceviche for starters. Hmm, I wish I would have liked this, but it was disappointing. Portion size was small for the price and the taste was lacking that citrus flavor that Ceviche is supposed to have. I ordered the beer steamed Peel n' Eat Old Bay Gulf Shrimp. They were pretty good size, just enough spice, and hit the spot for me. My friend ordered the Crabby Wings, but said that the next time he comes, he would try their Tiki Wings. All in all, I would definitely come back. The back patio area was a good size that had plenty of tables to accommodate many patrons, as was the seating in the bar area. 
The menu had a lot to offer and they have many specialty drinks. This place is worth a visit.",2021-01-20 23:02:00,373,1686,

We actually tried calling another company several times before Trenton Roofing, but while the other company never called us back, Trenton Roofing's response was immediate and positive.   We were connected to one of their roofing consultants, Brian Fallon, who inspected our roof, made recommendations, including replacing the leaky windows, and offered several choices reflecting roof strength and cost.     The estimates were very reasonable and we jumped in.    One selling point for us was that our roofing consultant would be present for the roof's installation and available for any questions or concerns we might have.
    Trenton Roofing was experiencing a busy period when we signed our contract, so we had to wait for several weeks for our roof to go on, but the calendar situation was made clear to us in advance, so the wait was no surprise.    Our consultant and the Trenton Roofing office staff kept us informed of the calendar choices.
     Our old roof went off and our new roof went on all on one day!     Trucks of workers arrived early and worked like a well-oiled machine, until our beautiful new roof was fully replaced--- all on the day before a big rain storm.   And when the storm hit:   No leaks!   We love the color.   We love feeling safe and secure that our roof has a 10-year workmanship guarantee.    We loved the fact that the work fully took place on one day.   We loved that the crew left our property spotless, with no trace of nails, shingles, or other materials.   We loved having one person who communicated regularly and accurately with us.   We would definitely recommend Trenton Roofing to anyone in the Princeton area needing a new roof.

I've gotten the plain white meat a few times before and it kept me coming back, but today I tried the buttermilk white meat and it is delicious! The chicken comes in nice large pieces and it was dusted with some tasty powder(Im not sure if it was some kind of buttermilk powder or some seasoning blend but it was amazing!) I was confused about why there was an option for both plain and buttermilk since I thought they would be basically the same, but they are definitely different and I can't wait for the next time I pick up a 5 piece of Chix & Wings buttermilk white meat!
The fries are nice and crispy and come in a little paper bag. There's not a lot included, but enough that I was full after 3 pieces of chicken and almost all of the fries. 
The to-go bag had a bunch of ketchup packets, some napkins and some plastic forks. There is also a self serve counter to grab all of these things, so I had more than enough after I grabbed everything without realizing it was already in the bag. 
There are signs on the window with covid guidelines, but while waiting for my food, someone else sat down pretty close to me in the waiting area and the employees didn't seem to care. The employees did have gloves, masks, and a plastic wall between them and the customers though, so they are taking some precautions.

My husband and I love living in Zionsville but often tell our friends that we wished more places were open past 9 or 10 PM on the weekends. Hotel Tango is open until 11 PM Monday-Saturday. Within 30 minutes of being here my husband turned to me and said that we found our new hangout spot. We met another couple and enjoyed lots of cocktails and a few food items. My husband had the Smokescreen which consists of bourbon, orange bitters, black walnut and turbinado. He had a handful, if that tells you anything about how much he enjoyed them. I started out with Leg Day which was a dessert cocktail with hints of banana and coconut. I also had the Auntie Vackser- hints of lemon and banana and the Sand In My Stockings- bourbon, orange, lemon. I would have every single drink again 10x over. Every single one was made to perfection and nothing was too sweet or had an overpowering flavor. Our AMAZING server Derek brought out a couple shots for us to try to see if we liked the flavor combinations. I can't wait to go back just to chat with him again and learn more about the cocktails they make. He was so welcoming and friendly. 
As far as food goes- I originally ordered the Buffalo chickpea dip and decided to change my order to the pulled pork nachos a minute later. They still brought the dip out, on the house, because they wanted us to let them know what we thought. Our friends had the chicken and bacon nachos. We all enjoyed the food. My husband loved the nachos. They use Broadripple Chip Co. sweet and spicy chips, which I looove, so I enjoyed them too. Derek sat down and asked how everything was multiple times and another woman (I didn't catch her name) came over to chat for a while too. 
The inside has a cozy feel with a fire place that we sat next to which made our visit even more enjoyable. They have lots of outdoor and indoor seating. Outdoor seating is dog friendly! They have tshirts and sweatshirts you can buy along with bottles of their liquor. They also pay tribute to veterans with their decor which I think is very cool.
Once the weather is warmer, me and my husband will be able to walk here from our house and people can easily walk here from downtown Zionsville.

The only real negative I have with this place is that it is much smaller than I imagined. Although they really pack the items in there. Not that it's cluttered. But the amount of interesting items that are on shelves,tables, hanging on the walls and from the ceiling. Make sure you look up and down as there are items all over the place. I was on a limited schedule trip so I didn't get to spend as much time in here as I would like to have. Remember it is a store but also a tourist attraction so the awesome stuff on display is not for sale (NFS on the price tag). The staff was very friendly and the prices are what you would expect at a place such as this. They have lots of memorabilia ( T-shirts,magnets,stickers,dish towels,etc ) from the show as well as the items they picked on some of the episodes (which are clearly marked with all of this information on the items price tags). I was here during the week on an off day in the middle of winter so Parking was not a problem. I parked directly across the street in a public parking lot (pay by the 15minute parking at a kiosk). Like I said it was a slow day so I was able to park my large pick up truck and travel trailer in the parking lot rather easy (could be a problem during peak tourist season). Just a note. Make sure you pay the reasonable fee to park as the meter maid was on top of this. As soon as I walked across the street. He came pulling up and checked everything was in order.

I WILL BE DISPUTING THE CHARGE WITH MY CREDIT CARD AS WELL AS CONTACTING ANY CORPORATE OFFICE YOU MAY HAVE.
Upon check you in, we have not received any complaint from you and at the time of check out also you did not mentioned anything about any issue.
THE FACT THAT I SHOWED YOU THE ROOM WAS COVERED IN BLOOD AND THAT I NEEDED NEW LINENS WAS NOT AN INDICATOR OF ISSUES? YOUR INCOMPETENCE HANDLING THESE ISSUES SHOWED I WAS BETTER OFF HANDLING THEM BY MYSELF
At the time of check out, you misbehaved with our staff in front of other guest which was really bad manner and INDISCIPLINE at public place. At the time of check out, you misbehave it our front desk staff and called them idiots. Other Guests in the lobby they also noticed your misbehavior and rudeness with the service staff who serve your during your stay.
FALSE. THERE WAS NO ONE THERE WHEN I CHECKED OUT EXCEPT THE PERSON BEHIND THE COUNTER WHO I HANDED MY KEY TO AND SOMEONE MAKING COFFEE INT HE OTHER ROOM. THERE ARE PLENTY OF CAMERAS THERE. IF THIS IS THE CASE I GIVE YOU PERMISSION TO POST MY PHOTO HERE OR A VIDEO SHOWING THIS ALLEGED CONDUCT. I WILL BE CONTACTING MY JAG OFFICE MONDAY TO SEE IF THERE IS ONLY LEGAL RECOURSE I HAVE TO MAKE YOU AMEND THIS STATEMENT.
Our service staff at Hotel they are working hard in this COVID and all are front line workers to help Doctors and Nurses during this hard time and you are calling Front line people Idiots is such a shame
AGAIN NO NAMES WERE HURLED ON MY END. I AM ALSO A FRONT LINE WORKER OPERATING MY OWN BUSINESS. YOU ARE ATTEMPTING TO SAVE FACE AND IT IS NOT WORKING. IF YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT COVID WHY ARE YOU NOT TAKING PRECAUTIONS LIKE WEARING MASKS WHEN INTERACTING WITH CUSTOMERS OR PROPERLY CLEANING ROOMS?
Did not feel like driving over 2 hours to go to Cove Haven for one night. As shown in the pictures there was what appeared to be blood on the walls. Went to inform staff and they handed me a bottle of cleaner and a rag and told to clean it up. The bedding and, as shown in the pics, was soiled. Who I believe was the person in charge handed me a new sheet and said she inspected this one and it was good to go. Got back to the room and that one was soiled as well. At this point I could tell they would be of no help. Me and my wife decided to just go to the store and purchase our own bedding. When we returned I used the cleaner they provided and wiped down all handles, switches, shower floor, and jacuzzi. Did not want to take 45 mins out of my stay to do it but we rarely get away.
When we returned I moved the table and chair in the room to a more central location. The mask you see in the photo if what I found under the chair. What you do not see are the leftover rose petals from previous customers, leaves from outside, lighter, and other trash I found under there.
Even if you decide to stay here after this review I would suggest bringing some cleaning wipes and sliders/flip flops to clean and walk around in. Would also suggest bringing your own bedding just incase.
If an employee reads this please do not respond with a blanket answer. I am a small business owner and personally address all customer concerns on an individual level and would expect the same. Do not try to use COVID as an excuse for one of your employees not handling the cleaning themselves. You could have asked us to wait in the lobby or outside while someone cleaned.

Have been many times and while the tap rotation seems to have slowed over the past year and sometimes they may have a beer for only a couple days can usually find something new  (my recently turned 21 y.o son was lucky to find his first Rapp Brewing Lemon  Creme donut here) .  You can take your beer in a  plastic cup as you stroll down the new pier and check out the pop up tent vendors on a weekend, sit at one of the outdoor chairs/table on the veranda and maybe catch view of a frolicking dolphin or two, or (my favorite) sit at the window ledge, penny encrusted, counter, people watch and consider your  blessings with your significant other(s)/mates. 

The food can be astonishingly good.  The meatloaf and smoked Gouda Mac and cheese stick out as favorites. Most of the time they have pretty good (low volume!!) tunes going although on occasion may have an obscenity laden NSF hardcore rap/punk song but they change it up if you ask.  

It can get crowded.  The tables are spaced but still a little too close for comfort for non vaccinated folks.   Bartender asked someone ordering a to go beer to mask up and refused to serve the guy when he whined which was great to see.  (He went out and got a mask and came back in)

The window display is messy, you'll either park and risk getting a ticket or find a spot three blocks over.  There is no real decor and I've never actually seen a menu unless I've somehow missed it. The donut flavors are not listed on the displays and you may feel rushed to make a decision. 

What you will come here for is a damn good donut. To impress your coworkers. To make your family happy. To feed your emotions with that glazed donut so light and fluffy you don't feel like you ate anything so make sure you get two. 

You will get fresh donuts and the trip will be worth it. They will pull them off the racks behind them and don't be surprised when you get in the car and can't help but bite one and you realize they are almost still warm and you practically wet your pants it's so good. If you want to feel more civilized. Get a side of donut holes to eat in the car - you can get them in multiples of 6. But get 12. The first six will go so fast and you will be going through withdrawal within minutes. 

Personally, I'm not a fan of cake or ""fancy"" donuts - I prefer glazed yeast donuts. These are so light and fluffy and delicious and dangerous. Just go there, support your local (black owned) business and you will laugh every time you drive by a Dunkin or a Krispy Whaaaaa.

When the pandemic started I attempted to reach out to another local supplier who never got back to me. I had to reach out a few times before getting a response and when I did, it seemed very low effort. In the end we decided to wait on purchasing home gym equipment because we really didn't have the space.  Fast forward to a new house and we now have room for a mini home gym! We aren't going to be lifting 600 lbs and also are limited on space so other online distributors seemed a bit overkill (for huge squat racks or power racks). We did buy a half rack from Dicks, but that's because it was the right size and price.  Next we wanted an adjustable bench and weights etc. The first time I stopped in I  was greeted by a sweet and friendly golden retrevior, Kade, I think. I appreciated the salesman's answered my questions without being pushy. 

So the next day my husband and I went back and we purchased an inspire adjustable fc1 bench that has attachments available for leg extension exercises and preacher curls ($125 for attachment, we went with the $329 bench). Overall, Spencer was amazing, super thorough, friendly and again, zero pressure. 

Currently the weights are coming and expected to be here towards the end of January, they are priced at $2 a lb (tip, the other local supplier has them priced at $3 a lb as we heard other customers talking about it), Nevada Home Fitness has not raised their prices for weights during this time which is pretty cool.  Then we got the base bar because again, we aren't going to be lifting all that much, for $150. 

They did recommend putting a deposit down which was $10, seriously, just $10.  So we placed the deposit on the bar, weights and attachment for the bench and then bought the bench home. 

While they loaded the bench, Spencer's girlfriend brought him lunch and she had two doggos in her car. The whole shop was happy to see the dogs and overall, just a very friendly vibe that I really appreciated and enjoyed. 

I wish they had a bit better selection for squat racks, they had a half rack but it was pretty much just the rack and didn't have the look to add any other attachments like a landmine, pegs for resistance bands etc, but only because we would have loved to support them for that purchase too.  

Anyways, I would highly suggest checking them out if looking for equipment, they had a lot of cardio (bikes, treadmills, rowers etc), and a lot of total body machines as well.  They also had a good selection of dumbells and kettlebells weights too.",2021-01-02 00:16:52,538,2584,

If you go here at 3pm-9pm, the wifi doesn't work so don't bother trying.

No masks or worn incorrectly and the staff never cleans. They didn't clean before covid either. The toilets are ALWAYS busted. The weights are never racked. I've spent over 30 minutes racking weights myself, so much so that gym members have actually asked me questions thinking I worked there. If you want to find a weight check behind the treadmills, that's where they're usually left. I even tested this by leaving weights I would need for the next day by leaving them behimd the treadmills and 2/3 times they were there over night.

I had a trainer for a year and he would tell me over and over how incompetent the management is. They know how dirty the place is, but they don't care. They know the weights are never racked, but they don't want to have their employees rack them. The management is so incompetent, even at a regional level, that the job turn over rate is unheard of. Every month or so half the staff quits and the other half LOUDLY complains during work outs how they want to quit. I dont know who Gage is, but your employees really hate you and you need to wash you're hands man.. Oh they also stupidly lie about it too. Like I have email chains that show a desk worker flat out say one thing and then Ashely (the manager) says another because they were caught in a lie and after talking to a lawyer the contract is designed to allow them to do just this.

A class trainer threw a 35 pound plate and almost hit my face and while trying to keep my distance from her, she saw me, thought I was giving dirty looks, and then threatened me. The manager defender her because they were friends and after fileing a complaint, her and management said if anything was to be done I would have to have a meeting but they repeatedly dodged me. My lawyer basically told me it'd be easier to deal with them by actually getting hurt, which is absurd that would the optimal option.

There are hidden fees of over $100 dollars a year. They also charged when gyms were closed because of the pandemic and because the contract requires you to cancel in person, you couldn't get out of paying it when you probably didn't have income because of the pandemic. 

The classes take priority and even if you need equipment from the area behind the classes they will stop the class entirely until to block you from getting any of that equipment because reasons. 

The ONLY time this gym is running acceptably is when they ask you to fill out servays. Like seriously fill those out. If you do theyll address the problems for 2 weeks. I tested this and it worked, I even got a meeting with the regional manager but he was so incompetent he couldn't make a single meeting with me THAT HE SCHEDULED and if I wanted to meet him he required it would have to be at random times as if I had no schedule or job or class.",2021-01-08 21:45:21,623,3016,

The home was originally rented directly by the owner, Bill Hanson, but turned over to Avenue after conflicts with the owner occurred repeatedly. At first we were thrilled to not have to deal with the owner since he clearly was inept and unqualified to deal with tenants. We had issue after issue in the house. Mostly dealing with plumbing issues. These issues were either not addressed or inadequately addressed. 

Upon move out, the leasing agent, Michael Golde, told us that we would be responsible for cleaning the home and making sure to shampoo the carpets. During the final walk-through, Michael indicated that we cleaned the home better than he'd ever seen a home cleaned during his time as a leasing agent of rental properties. We cleaned all the appliances, walls, floors, anything else remaining in the home. We made sure that all the lights worked and the home was in at least as good of shape when we left it as it was when we initially rented it. The lease provided to us, that we signed, indicated that we were responsible for cleaning and any damage. We cleaned and repaired everything. 

We now arrive at the point where our deposit is supposed to be returned and are informed that they (Mr. Hanson) is retaining money to rekey the backdoor, which we never received keys for upon move in, and for painting because of the spackle we applied to the nail holes from hanging pictures on the walls. Hanging pictures is not what the statute in Missouri would consider ""damage"", although that is what Michael would have me believe. No paint was provided for us to paint over the nail holes, so we would have had to match the paint somehow since the paint was grey not white or off-white like most places. They pay their maintenance worker $15 an hour while charging us $80 for the rekeying of the door and $100 for someone to paint.

As I was getting my pedicure which lasted maybe 15 minutes. There was no massage, which I found peculiar as I'm watching other technicians give a massage. She cut my toe.... not once, but twice. Like actual bloodied. She never once said sorry or acted as if she cared. Beyond rude. 

I asked for a rounded gel manicure... she filed my nails almost pointy.  At that point I was beyond over it. She refused to listen to my pleas even when I reminded her ""rounded please, I don't like the pointy."" 

She didn't speak to me. She didn't smile. She was clearly annoyed by my business.  

I've never felt more unwelcomed.

As I went up to pay, the receptionist asked the woman in front of me how her service was... she responded with not great as I was cut a few times.  2 new clients bloodied. Nothing was done. Nobody cared. 

I still tipped more than 20% but I really shouldn't have. 
Lesson learned.

I'm giving 2 stars because the receptionist was really sweet.  And the salon was gorgeous.",2021-01-05 20:44:51,325,1478,

Waitress showed up a minute later; no greeting other than ""what can I get you to drink?"" Skinny girl with a ponytail, Coke bottle glasses and a ton of costume jewelry. When the Queen Bee asked a couple of questions she seemed to have a notion of what she was talking about.

Queen Bee settled on trying breakfast burrito. It was a behemoth served with a nice pile of home fries. That thing pretty much has everything but the kitchen sink wrapped up in a huge grilled tortilla. She enjoyed it and took half of it home for lunch tomorrow!

I had corned beef hash and eggs with hash browns and rye toast. I was under the impression that they made their own hash in-house; I was wrong. Still pretty tasty and grilled to a crisp. Spuds also grilled crisp and what can I say about toast? It was toasted, buttered and sliced in half. Large slices of bread though. 

I was underwhelmed with the service between the character who seated us and our dear waitress. She at least did check in with us a couple of times to refill coffee cups, etc.  Steve the owner stopped by our table as we finished up. That was very nice of him and we chatted for a moment or two. That's how I know the hash wasn't homemade; LOL!

For a national 'monument' this is a wonderful place to visit. The arch itself is a unique and the area it overlooks has a rich history. This is a great trip for school age children to learn about the westward expansion of the U.S. We didn't have time to look through the museum portion but it appeared to be full of interactive exhibits.

If you want to know more about the sites that you can see from the top of the arch, ask a ranger some questions. They are full of knowledge. For instance, we had no idea the Eads Bridge was the first steel bridge in the U.S.

This might be the 'quickest visit' of all the national parks. We visited with our 5 month old daughter (her first 'national park'). It was a short enough visit between feedings, naps and diaper changes to finish the tram tour before someone got fussy. Note that you can leave your stroller at the queue for the tram. Our baby was not at all scared by the ride up to the top but it was noisy. 

I feel the park is taking all the necessary precautions they can to keep visitors safe during the pandemic including limiting the number of guests on the tours and having one directional entrances and exits.

The cafe inside the museum is open but it only caters to those ok with eating greasy and fried food. At least there's an option when many cafes are closed due to the pandemic.

The outside waterfront area is a good place to take some pictures of the arch but other than that it is pretty bleak. This is why I am so confused about the national park status. We did see a few people riding bikes on the paths, but really there's not much to do in terms of outdoor activities unless you want to stare at the river or the arch or the huge city behind the arch. 

I believe they have a boat tour at the park but it wasn't operating. Not sure if that was due to the season or the pandemic. I love a boat tour but this area is really industrial and I'm not sure it would be a very interesting tour other than more arch and bridge factoids. I could be wrong and might take the tour when we pass through again to visit family in southwest Missouri.",2021-01-18 16:27:32,457,2192,

Crawfish isn't even season right now and the pasta was still sooooooo good so I was really impressed. Very flavorful and creamy. I also got a side of their jambalaya which i wasn't too much of a fan of, but I won't hold it against them. For dessert i got their bread pudding with whiskey sauce....... OH MY GOD.. AMAZING!!!! I started doing the happy dance when I took the first bite. Only place whose bread pudding rivals theirs that I've personally had is Pappedeaux (if you're from Texas you know). We walked in for dinner maybe 30 mins before close and i still felt like my server was attentive and the food quality didn't suffer. Its important to note that we were waiting for about 20-30 mins outside prior so keep that in mind before visiting. This place is very popular amongst natives from New Orleans and tourists alike. When I come back to New Orleans I will definitely have to come back here and this time i will be sure to try the gumbo and other popular items they serve... all of their food looks really good to be honest.

Everyone was nice. That helps. The next day (yes, I came back), my order was ready to go as soon as I got there, so give them a chance!

The Chicken Teriyaki is where it's at, preferably with Yakisoba noodles, though the fried rice is also very good. I tried the Tofu, which was fine (it's tofu, whaddya want?), but I have to admit that I was disappointed with the Salmon. You get a good mix of protein, starch, and veggies per order, and at a decent price. It would be nice to get a LITTLE more food - I'd like to be a little more full after spending ~$10, give or take, but I guess that's just how it works, these days (I have a similar issue with Honeygrow, nearby, in that the food is good, but I can't cheaply fill up my bottomless pit of a stomach).

We ordered a smattering of items: the Buffalo chicken pizza, black bean chimichangas, Philly cheesesteak, meatballs on garlic bread, fried texican potato, cheesecake & banana carob bread pudding. 

The pizza was PHENOMENAL. I was blown away. I am a born and raised NYer. I am a pizza snob and I loved this pizza. I almost went back the next night to get another but I resolved to wait until next weekend lol 

Cheesesteak was delicious, chimichangas were good, my fiancé ate all the bbq seitan off the fried texican potato after I tapped out but I fried up what was left in the AM with some eggs (sorry not plant based!) and it was dynamite. The meatballs left a little to be desired, but I think mostly Bc it was take out and the bread got soggy. I think fresh in house it would be delish. 

The cheesecake was like, healthy dessert. You know the type. Not bad, but not my fav. Next time I'll double down on the banana carob bread pudding which knocked my socks off. 

I'm so thankful we found this place. I am probably going to be minimizing my dairy intake for the long haul and this is my new go-to spot for pizza and other dairy-less treats!

The Chocolate Lounge was unfortunately closed. 

The lady behind the counter was so kind and helpful. I was overwhelmed by all the choices, I basically just asked, ""what is the best milk chocolate bar you have?"" She was more than happy to point out her top choices and explain a bit of the background behind each bar. I was leaning towards something a little crunchy, so I went with Dick Taylor Hazelnut Milk Chocolate. With hazelnuts from Oregon and cacao from Brazil, every bite was delightful. It was more of an earthy chocolatey taste, with the milk taking the backseat on this one for subtlety, but enough to bring balance to the flavor. 

I also went home with a box of 8, all very solid choices:
- Salted Caramel: Dark shell with a bit of rum and sea salt
- Fresh Mint: Dark ganache, lemon & mint combination
- Ecuadorian Heirloom: 85% cacao is pushing it but it was good
- Hibiscus Flower: I didn't get to try this one but they loved it!

This is a park for everybody, and it's a great place to appreciate the outdoors in Indy.

The last time we visited, it was on a free day, so we didn't have to pay admission. But usually, Fort Harrison requires a fee to enter. So bring yo cash if you want to visit, or get a state park pass, which will allow you to enter via the pass.

We usually always visit the playgrounds, which are fun but nothing to go out of your way to visit. I certainly wouldn't pay admission just to visit these playgrounds, but if you're here and you have playground-age children, then you must go. 

The last time we were at Fort Harrison, we brought hot dogs and picnic accoutrements, and used one of the grills available to cook out. It was nice because we had our own little spot with two picnic tables and a grill, and it was near the woods, so we hiked into the woods after eating. While in the woods, we discovered some forts made out of tree branches that kids could fit in. Could this be why Fort Harrison is named as such, because there are forts in the park? 

I feel like this would be a good park to run through, because there were lots of paved paths that went along the greenspaces and through the woods.

We enjoyed our few moments visiting the restaurant to retrieve our meal.

We started with the lobster bisque, and the Caesar salads that both meals came with. Stir the soup really well before tasting. Very good! The consistency is what you'd want out of a bisque- nice and creamy. The Caesar salad were good, but the croutons were GREAT. 

For our entrees we opted for the chicken parm and the seafood lasagna. The chicken parm was a little sad. The chicken was very greasy and lacking a little crispness. Personally, I love a nice browned mozz on top which this did not have. But worse than the chicken parm, was the seafood lasagna. I was so excited for this bc I've never had anything like it. It just wasn't good. The peppers were definitely too over powering and the crab, scallops, and shrimp seemed to be a little overdone inside. A very heavy dish. Very creamy and cheesy. We only got through a few bites before moving it to the fridge.

The bread was straight off the presses from Subway as far as I could tell and it was served with what looked and tasted like margarine.  But the biggest fail came at dessert.  Our waitress who inexplicably was also our busser and also brought our plates (staffing issues?) had never done a banana's foster or was just taught in the back ten minutes prior to the order.

We absolutely adore Derick and want to take him out to brunch as a huge thankful! Overall, the staff was too tier and we will be back!

I haven't had TS in a while and was in the mood for a smoothie so I stopped here. I walked in and there were already 3-4 ppl waiting in the lobby, no workers at the counter or in the prep area. A few mins pass by and 4-5 workers come from the back, no sense of urgency. The staff comes out loudly laughing and joking  around. The gentleman in front of me ordered a smoothie and so did I. We waited for so long for one smoothie each. Customers were visibly annoyed and the staffed cared less. A few people spoke up, I didn't but I couldn't wait to get to my car and write this review. One customer had an online order and his food was waiting at the counter minus his smoothie. He mentioned his smoothie was missing and the food was getting cold. They took the sandwich back to remake as he waited for the smoothie to be made. He got the smoothie finally and had to wait even longer for the food LOL!! Talk about poor service!! I sat and watched as other customers walked in, poorly greeted by workers (no one stayed at the front counter) one person received a head nod as acknowledgement lol. I sat back as orders of food and smoothies who ordered after me got their orders before me!!! My receipt was stamped for 1:39 minutes away from 2 I was walking out with one smoothie.

 Yesterday I had the opportunity to visit (couldn't check in due to app problems) while hitting up my favorite eatery.  I was hoping to gain inspiration, and find creative ways and ideas for dealing with all the stuff I own.  I came prepared ready to purchase, armed with measurements, and my own tape measurement.  Hubby was along for the ride, reluctantly, but was to be my voice of expertise as I'm the planner and project manager but he has to ultimately execute my ideas. There were a few projects in my home I wanted to tackle and fully expected to leave with a several purchases.

However I left empty handed.  While the store is nice and large and does have an assortment of storage ideas for every item imaginable it lacked creativity.  I didn't find inspiration or any ideas that I haven't already thought of myself.  All I discovered were tons of people (and hard to social distance in some isles) and rows and rows of overpriced plastic goods.  The custom closet department especially was crowded and the floor displays had price tags that matched buying a used car.  I see no reason to come here vs Ikea, which has similar displays and custom services, and the same particleboard quality.

Makes me wonder do Container Store customers have no idea that Dollar Tree and Dollar Generals exist?  Even Walmart, Target, and any big box retailer sells pretty much the same plastic bins at a fraction of the cost.  I still can't get over their prices.  I expected to be wowed, but left disappointed.

One thing I do know, it's not even a challenge to replicate their storage solutions by visiting a dollar store.  It's elementary!",2021-01-11 16:48:55,371,1853,

I made an appointment through coast dentals appointment setter who initially set me up at the WRONG location. I don't blame this facility for that. But when It was scheduled correctly, I get a call the day before my appointment asking can I come in at a different time bc the dentist has allot of work to do.  I reluctantly agreed. I have two kids and a job as well as a dental emergency. Unfortunately the time they decided did not meet anyone's needs. I don't know why they think we can just rearrange our lives soo easily. 
I spoke to them and was rescheduled to come in the next day at noon bc it's a dental emergency and bc of the prior trouble.
Again, I'm coming in for a tooth that is already been examined By them pre covid. 

Day of appointment: 8:21 am. I get a call from coast dental saying they are canceling my appointment, the Dr. cannot see me at all at this location AT ALL. No charge, no warning, no nothing. Totally confused. So I asked, I have a warranty on my appliance that was made by your facility. How is that honored? And she simply suggested to just go to another dentist. That doesn't solve anything!

The rooms are a bit outdated but our room was clean & the bed extremely comfortable. The maids aren't entering rooms right now due to covid but we found a clean bag of towels & toiletries outside of our room every day. Anything we needed a call down to the desk & they delivered in minutes. 

The rooms have microwave & mini fridge as well as a Keurig with coffee assortment & tea. The products in the bathroom are Bath & Body Works.  Tv has large variety of channels including all the HBO channels. We brought microwave popcorn & enjoyed watching a movie or 2 before bed. 

The sunset views are AMAZING. We were able to spot dolphins one night swimming close to the hotel! 
There is a sunset countdown clock in the lobby & they do a countdown in Jimmys. Loved Jimmys. So convenient to have a good restaurant on the property right downstairs. Great to grab a bite after traveling before we knew the area or where to go. The breakfasts were huge. We saved 1/2 &  had breakfast for the next day too. Tried most of their food. All very good. Service was on point. Love the live music every night!  

The location could not be better. We walked everywhere.... convenient store , shopping, beach, all the great restaurants! Cesare's on the beach was a short walk for a wonderful Italian dinner night out. We skipped dessert everywhere we ate because we loved the ice cream at the shop down the road & the crepes right next door. 
Beautiful views of the island from Jimmys rooftop at the edge next door. Gorgeous clean heated pool & cute arcade. Yes the machines are old & some weren't working correctly but we still had fun getting in some skee ball, Ms PacMan & air hockey. 

The beach is beautiful. Access is out the front to the left. There are restrooms & chairs/ cabanas to rent. Right across from many places to eat as well. 

The Causeway is a short Uber ride away for under $9 & there are restaurants & shops as well as the boat tours, dinner cruises etc. This is where Pier 60 beach is located as well. Lots of activities there. 

There is a trolley that runs up & down the main roads. Look for the poles with the big sun on them. Trolleys are free right now because of covid.

Food is gross, place is dirty, service is awful. I should have trusted my instincts when I walked in and saw how disgustingly dirty the vents over the hostess stand were. When we sat down, I immediately saw the caked on food on the wall next to our table. Our table had not been cleaned yet and there was no place else to sit, so my husband and I sat down at a dirty table. We waited so long before being greeted and having someone clean our table off that we almost left. In hindsight I wish we would have. We ordered the steamed dumplings to start off with. They came in a heap of mushiness, all stuck together and also somehow falling apart. I went ahead and tried one - cold, mushy, no taste at all. No thank you. The miso soup is just beef broth; there doesn't appear to be any miso in it at all. The salad was at least edible but you could tell the dressing was loaded with sugar. Also, we had to practically beg for silverware - twice - before we got it. I watched our server do everything else but bring us silverware and we sat just looking at our food for an unreasonable amount of time without being able to eat it.

We were really hoping that the bento boxes we ordered would be better than the starters but they were worse. My tuna was supposed to be rare/just seared. It was completely overcooked. The egg roll was ice cold. The sushi roll was completely tasteless but for the salmon which tasted like it was on its way out. I'm not sure that I've ever been as disappointed in a meal. My husband's was just as bad. We never do this but both my husband and I looked at each other and agreed that it wasn't even worth staying. We were hungry and we weren't going to eat anything that was put in front of us. We are not picky eaters at all! It was just that terrible.

Not that the server checked on us to see how we were doing, or brought us the chopsticks we asked for. I had to get up and locate her and tell her that we are not happy with anything and if she could please bring us our check. No answer, she just walked away from me. I would have liked a response but honestly just wanted to get out of there and assumed she was going to get us our check or the manager (not that I asked for one) or something to remedy this. She came back with our check with only the dumplings removed. Whatever. I'm no Karen. I just wanted to get out of there and get something edible. I worked for years as a server and I am ALWAYS a good tipper but I could not bring myself to tip on top of spending $26 on food we didn't eat and service that was barely even existent.

It really sucks because we live right by Kabuto and really wanted to love it. Obviously we are never going back. We should have looked at the reviews before going.",2021-01-18 19:31:28,613,2810,

The temperature was in the low 50's and we had to book the tickets in advance. We arrived promptly on time since our time slot was scheduled from 10am-12pm  for the snow tubing.  I had paid for parking when I placed an order for my tickets. A couple of days before the event I was texted a link with my ticket information and when I arrived they scanned it and I went through.  Upon entering  we were red wristlets that had our our scheduled time.  Before snow tubing they were giving us instructions and from there we proceeded and went and got our tubes, we decide to go together as a couple so we did the tubing for two. We caught this escalator that took us to the top and from there it was history. We  went down the slopes  like a total of eight times, we did three rounds in the single tubing.  Later we proceeded to the igloo which was pretty cool, but honestly there was enough ice produced to make snowballs. I feel that section is more appropriated towards small children. We sat there for awhile and enjoyed the cool weather. The igloo you can literally stay there all day. Once we exited we saw a couple of logs that I guess they lit up if you wanted to warm up. Also they had food stands and booths that sold alcohol, but I'm guessing due to our time of day that we chose majority were closed.

Suggestions:  1.  purchase tickets and parking online 
                         2.  purchase hand gloves

At that time, the installer and his assistant were prompt, professional, and did an amazing job. I realize I should have written a review then, but it just slipped my mind.

Fast forward 2+ years later, and there was an issue with the controller for the water heater. I was having some renovations done, so my gas line was turned off. When it was turned back on, the pilot light had gone out on the water heater and I found that I couldn't get it lit again. Remembering who installed the water heater, I called Reno Plumbing Doctor again, told them the nature of my emergency, and they sent someone out the same day. The contractors working on my house were amazed that someone would come out that quickly, and several of them asked who I was using (potential future customers).

When the technician arrived, he was able to troubleshoot the problem and replaced the entire controller. With everything working again, he then told me that the two-year warranty on the water heater actually ran out two weeks prior, but Reno Plumbing Doctor WOULD HONOR IT ANYWAY, since it was so close. I know plenty of companies that would not do this, at least not without some hefty pursuasion, but Reno Plumbing Doctor obviously wants to retain my business and is willing to do what it takes to make that happen.

All my experiences with this company have been positive, if not outright glowing, so I would heartily recommend them for anyone's plumbing needs. Barring some drastic change on their end, I will never use anyone else.",2021-01-26 18:03:45,328,1651,

I've been going to the adjoining Brass Tap once a week for the last month, and people are always going there thinking it is The Hatchery. The giant Brass Tap sign is not a good clue, I guess. Nor are the 30 something beer taps in plain sight. Still, I figured if people are so hungry for The Hatchery that they are going blind and/or illiterate, it must be worth trying.

Well, I did try it today. And now I just wish I'd tried another beer next door. 

I got chicken strips. They took about 25 minutes. I don't know why. Lots of other people got lots of other chicken while I waited. They must have known that I am a connoisseur of chicken and tried extra hard.

I will say, the meat is definitely clean and white and the young woman who tried to help me was very nice, even though she was powerless to get me any chicken for nearly half an hour. She was obviously working very hard, and kept telling the kitchen folk they should probably get me some chicken. The place was also very clean. I used the restroom and it was spotless. That was the highlight of my visit.

My strips, I took to go, when I eventually got them. This seemed like the safest bet, since strips are apparently so hard to come by. I found them to be weirdly sweet, with an aftertaste that lasted a long time. Not as long as it took to get the chicken, of course, but a long time. Some bites were greasy. Some bites were not. 

It wasn't gross, but it wasn't good, either. I'll go back to The Hatchery again, maybe, but only if I'm so thirsty that I lose my vision and think that it is a Brass Tap.",2021-01-10 17:54:00,370,1626,

My experience, unlike most people's, was very disappointing due to the inattentive service and average food. I would give this place a 1 star because I left completely dissatisfied, but the only thing that warranted a 2-star rating was the fact that the food was still edible. 

For starters, which was the best thing about this dinner experience, I ordered the deviled eggs and the meatballs. Meatballs were pretty good, but could use a little more seasoning since it was borderline bland. The sourdough bread was hard and I could tell they were old. The popular deviled eggs were good as I'm a big fan of deviled eggs, but I thought they were basic and not restaurant-quality. 

The entrees were underwhelming. I waited 30 minutes after the appetizers for the entrees to come out only to be disappointed by the very basic food. The pork chop was moist and tasted okay, but the Mac and cheese looked and tasted like they came out of a school's cafeteria. The collard greens was so watery and left a pool of water that mixed with the cheese from the Mac and cheese, which looked unappetizing. The hot chicken was moist and seasoned well. 

Service was terrible. Waters were left empty for a while only to be refilled once. While we waited half an hour for our entrees, the waiter never bothered to check on the status of our food. Overall, the food definitely did not taste like they were worth the wait. I also noticed a table of 2 that came after us that got their entrees much sooner than our table.

Do NOT come here if you WANT patrons masked; however, 100% of the staff IS masked. (Since September, restaurants & bars have been fully open.)

Open Monday thru Saturday 11 AM till 2 AM, & 11 AM till 12 AM on Sundays, this pub has a minimum of 26 wall TVs (that I counted)-- a perfect place to watch sports!  It has a bar that offers 20 drafts, as well as the usual bottles.

Lots of specials here; the pub's webpage has a specials calendar. One regular notable offering is the $9.99 Killian's Pitchers & Burger Day ($7 & $9). There's also LIVE MUSIC on the weekends. Two popular (& excellent) local bands are James Galione Band & Bryan James Band. Highly recommend both, especially if you like upbeat classic rock. 

On each visit, service has been excellent @ both the bar & the tables/booths. The food has been very good to excellent-- the wings ($6.99 - $24.99); The Patty Melt Burger @ $12; The Pub Club ($10) are all very good; & the Pub Style Shepherd's Pie is EXCELLENT (Full $13 or Half $10)! O'Briens even offers 6 desserts, including the Cinnamon Creme Brulee Cheesecake @ $8, which was very good.

Outside there are a few tables near the entrance where you're likely to find some friendly bikers smoking or couples w/ canines. The bathrooms have always been clean, & my sensitive nose has never detected any bad smell anywhere in this Irish pub (as another reviewer mentioned).

I used to order takeout from here about 3-4x a week since 2016/2017 and had to take a break because my family wanted to switch it up- not Mcalisters fault they USED to take very good care of getting our order right. 

Fast forward to a few weeks ago- I was craving it again and was coming here once again 3x a week. The staff is totally different. We used to love
Getting take out from here it was affordable and easy dinner option because my husbands works until late at night

I am on a strict diet and make some changes to my salad and my husband's so it can fit our dietary restrictions. They mess up at least one thing on my order every time and i guess it's my fault for not checking the salad before I leave . Previous staff used to pull the salad out of the bag to make sure they got it right. I complained last week because they forgot the chicken on my salad. 

I'm upset because my husband comes home late ready to eat his salad and instead of chipotle ranch dressing I ask for for his salad they gave me chipotle peach bbq sauce that goes on one of their sandwiches - He dumps it on his salad without thinking it was a wrong sauce and maybe the sherry shallot that comes with it. 

I really don't know why they gave me a sandwich sauce. And not a dressing - ANY dressing. I called to talk to a manager and he acts as if I am a dumbass Bc the sauce tastes like a bbq sauce and says ""they don't have bbq sauce"". Instead of trying to help us problem solve and correct the problem. We can't eat this salad with this bbq tasting sandwich sauce - so we have a ruined salad. I asked if he can replace it and said he would only give us more salad dressing not a new salad. 

Your store got our order wrong - not me! So make it right is all I ask. For his rudeness I will NEVER eat Mcalister's again.",2021-01-12 02:38:26,388,1823,

I went there with my wife and 2 kids (aged 10 and 13). Coming from the Lone Star State, we are used to Texas BBQ and this was our first experience with Tennessee BBQ. We walked in with a 100% open mind and went 'hog' wild with our order. Some Texans are a little snobby about their BBQ but not us.

Our order: ribs, brisket, turkey, chicken wings, Mac-N-Cheese, hush puppies and of course French fries. 

One thing I can 100% say is that the 'smoke' on all of the meats was terrific. 

Ribs: We had the 'wet' ribs and they were really good. In Texas we're used to beef ribs but the pork ones were spot on juicy and tasty. Great size too. The sauce on them was standout good.

Brisket: A little dry for my liking but it's been my experience that this is par for the course for restaurants. It's tough to keep a brisket warm and juicy. For me that's where the sauces come in. Good taste though. Smoke ring on the brisket was great (if you're into that kind of thing).

Turkey:  I didn't think I would but I really liked the turkey. It was juicy which honestly threw me off a bit.

Chicken Wings: Being originally from Buffalo, NY, I'm not a fan of smoked wings and neither was my son (who is a Texas native) but he said they were crispy and I seen they had a nice color.

Mac-N-Cheese: I liked the Mac-N-Cheese, creamy and good smoke taste.

Hushpuppies: The hushpuppies were really good and I would highly recommend them with the light orange sauce (name not known, sorry).

I myself had the 'Redneck Taco' with the shredded pork. I really liked this. I had 2 different sauces on it but due to COVID I couldn't tell which one it was since they don't have them on the table and weren't labelled in the containers. I did find a nice sized bone in the pork while eating it which put a damper on the meal though (I have a fear of dying like this, sorry). The coleslaw and corn tortilla both were darn good and added to the overall dish. The fries were just OK but some of them did taste a little off like they had been in the same grease as the hushpuppies or catfish.

The new location of Martin's is very open and has tons of funky signs and posters like the old one did (as seen on DDD). Lots of fun to look around at all of it which brought back good memories of a simpler time (yeah I'm old but not ancient). That was a good thing because our order took a long time to get out to us, though I'm not sure why since it was slow when we went. 

The help was very friendly but they didn't seem to know a lot about the sauces when I asked which being a first time guest was irritating. I was a little surprised by that since they sell them by the bottle. 

Warning: If it is under 50 degrees out and you're dining in make sure you bring a coat. Even when closed, the garage doors they have let in a lot of the cold. Now while it wasn't freezing it was uncomfortable at times especially sitting on the steel seats. The women and kids were more put off than the guys if that matters, just sayin'.

Overall, I would recommend Martin's. However, after I left it felt that this COVID crap had stolen another great experience from me that I had waited so long for. I definitely will go back there when the sauces are on the table and I can try them all and know what the h-e-double hockey sticks each one is and tastes like.",2021-01-09 07:10:12,767,3446,

We had dinner here on Saturday night, but stopped by earlier in the day to request a more sequestered table. That meant not being in the mint-green main room, but rather the area off the bar, which was fine for us because we were by ourselves in there for almost our entire meal. It's still charming with lots of oyster-dish decor, and we sat under a massive painting of a pelican, which tickled our daughter pink. Also, we were impressed that they were doing temperature checks and actually *did* have spaced out tables.

We got some cocktails off the drink menu (Sazerac, Paper Plane, couple other random ones)--all were fine but nothing special. For apps, it was turtle soup, seafood gumbo, and the creole caesar salad. One of us was nervous about the turtle since she didn't love her ""gator experience"" at Cochon, but you really can't taste it at all since the flavoring of the broth, etc is so intense. The gumbo was, no surprise, incredible...we have yet to have a bad bowl in this town. But--WHO DAT--caesar salad!!! Once you have an oyster dressing, you really wonder why it would ever be made with anything else. Amaaaaazing--possibly the best dish.

Mains were the pecan dusted redfish and the chicory rubbed roasted beef tenderloin. The fish was OK; there was a good amount of crab but it got diluted by the intense sherry cream. It would have been nice to have had more of the artichokes on the dish. The tenderloin was definitely better, but we could have sworn that it was prepared sous-vide even though that wasn't indicated on the menu and isn't our favorite way of eating meat (yeah, yeah, we know all the arguments, yada yada, boring); its whole roasted shallot (SINGULAR) wasn't roasted well enough but we enjoyed the charred radicchio.

Bananas foster. We have a lot to say about this. First of all, the menu says it's $10 and that there's a minimum order of two people, but that seems like a super cagey way of indicating that you'll in fact be charged twice. It's $10 extra, whatever, but that doesn't strike us as classy. The whole enjoyment of the dessert really just comes in the performance of the thing with the flames up in the air table-side (our daughter LOVED this), but the dish itself isn't that good. At all. The bananas were still too hard (i.e. not cooked/soft enough) and the ice cream was so freaking frozen solid that it melted into the warm sauce, so you're kind of just eating the whole thing like a soup. We're not saying it tasted bad--it didn't--but we had high expectations and they were not met.

So food would be 4 stars even with the hiccups, but service wasn't very good. The ""second-in-command"" or whoever he was kind of fumbled around everything he did (was he new??) and while our server himself did a decent job, we didn't find him to be particularly hospitable, especially considering that we were the ONLY people in his section! Also, he failed to inform us that our daughter's kid's pasta dish (overcooked farfalle with parmesan) and side of fresh fruit was $15 (LOLZZZZ). But here's the real kicker of what happened: About half way through the meal one of us realized that he tucked his legs under a chair that had gum on it, which got all over his pants. We let our server know (to switch it out) and he just seemed really unfazed. A manager did come over to drop a business card to get in touch about a dry cleaning bill, but their whole response was nonchalant and ""whatever, dude"" about it. That was disappointing.

Gah, this review is so long! Dunno how we feel overall. We'll definitely not be back again and we're unsure whether or not we would even recommend it to others. At the end of the day we had a good meal and a pleasant evening with our three-year-old--who was on excellent behavior, thank goodness--but it was a lot of money for not a lot of high quality, so we're rounding down from 3.5 stars to 3.",2021-01-05 02:59:11,862,3956,

After moving from Hawaii to the east coat in 2014, my wife and I have been looking for a Japanese restaurant that served high quality sushi and other Japanese style foods.  After a long search, we have finally found our home.  We moved to the Tampa/St. Petersburg area back in early September after living in the D.C. area for 5 years.  In both places, my wife and I looked for a good Japanese restaurant.  We would find okay ones but nothing rocked our world.

That is until now.  We had driven by the location (where E.B.I. is now located) prior to its opening, hoping another Japanese restaurant would go in, and low and behold our prayers were answered.  We notice that shortly after E.B.I. open, the parking lot was always full.  We took that as a good sign and last night, we finally got to see why.

Our wonderful experience started off with our server Jamie.  Just absolutely warm and wonderful person.  She new the menu well and after listening to us, made some recommendations.  I ordered some Nigiri sushi (Tuna and Yellow Tail) for my wife and I and for my entre, I ordered the Pork Katsu with fried rice and my wife ordered the ""Little B Roll"".  The orders came with Miso soup.

The Miso soup was incredibly fresh and was wonderfully soothing.   The sushi came out afterward and again the word that comes to mine is fresh.  Also the quality of the sushi was simply outstanding.  In many places the sushi has dyes and is injected with water to increase weight.  Not the case here.  Oh...  did I tell you about the price!  Maguro (tuna) is usually $12 to $14 for a serving of two pieces.  Here, it is $6.50 for the same serving.  The price is awesome just on its own, but the quality is simply amazing and the taste... Heaven!

As we are enjoying this wonderful meal, Dawn, one of the owners come over to the table.  What a wonderful person.  We find that we both had living in Hawaii in common and were even there at the same time.  We talked about the fresh fish and how hard it is to find on the mainland.  Dawn explained that they have to caste a very wide net to get the quality that they are serving and you can tell.  Her husband, Patrick who was working behind the counter with sushi chefs Bobby and Alan came over to say hello.

We talked about favorites (seared ahi) and an Iron Chef Morimoto favorite Hamachi (yellow tail tuna).  Patrick and the team made up the requested suggestions and wow!  The seared ahi was simply amazing.  I could of order another round were is not for the Pork Katsu I had already eaten.  The Hamachi was as good as I remember and Morimoto's restaurant in Honolulu except that I didn't have to pay the $26 for the serving like in Hawaii.

We also talked about the shrimp trucks on the North Shore of Oahu and of course the most famous Shrimp Truck is Giovanni's.  They have a Garlic Shrimp that is to die for and you can get it right here.  It's awesome.

The Little B Roll is amazing and I highly recommend it to anyone and the Pork Katsu is a generous order and if you are hungry, this is the thing that will hit the spot.

My wife and I will be soon and often.  Come join us and enjoy not only a wonderful restaurant, with great ambiance and warmth, but enjoy the wonderful people who work there.  You can taste the passion they bring in the food.

Note:  The photos we took after we started eating.  The serving are much larger. The food was so good we kind of forgot to take the picture first.",2021-01-16 23:07:41,733,3479,

I often like to get the specials. One time it was a posole (AMAZING) and another time it was fried chicken with mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts. Their fried chicken is honestly one of the best Ive had. The breading Tastes healthier but nice and crispy. The chicken is of high quality and perfectly cooked. 

Some of my favorite items-
1- fig burger. Astounding. The goat cheese pairs so well with the argula, carmelized onions and fig preserves. 
2- the kale chicken salad with fried chicken. Honestly so bomb. I don't even like kale but the maple mustard vinaigrette is delicious. You can tell they make their dressings in-house. Ive had this salad with grilled chicken and its also super delicious. I normally don't like berries/dried cherries in my salads (I'm a savory gal) but Im so glad I gave this a shot because now I get it all the time and always crave it. Arguably one of the best salads in Santa Barbara. 
3- cheeseburger eggrolls- seems unusual before you try them but tasty. 
4- brussel sprouts 
5-fries - my boyfriend refuses to share his so I always gave to order my own. Perfectly crispy everytime. Dip them in their Rosemary Aioli. 
6-  mashed potatoes with rosemary gravy 
7- anything with their fried chicken (obviously) 
8- THE COOKIE DESSERT.
9- the little kitchen burger (just a classic.)
10- chicken tikka masala (so flavorful and good comfort food)
11 - mac n cheese 

...I can probably go on and on. I'm somewhat of a food quality snob and this place is always consistently good. I've never had anything I didn't love here. The chefs here clearly know how to cook everything perfectly. 

Definitely recommend giving this a try if you haven't already!",2021-01-11 02:22:23,358,1783,

I had never been in such pain in my entire life and it was evident yet I waited 8 hours in that emergency room only to be seen by a resident who seemed very rushed and annoyed. I was sent home with antibiotic gel that I could not get into my eye because the pain was so acute and it when I would try to open my eyelid my eye would immediately start watering like crazy and the gel would not go in, it would fall right out of my eye. I mentioned this to every doctor and resident I saw in my next five or so follow-ups at Wills Eye and not one of them offered any assistance or suggestions, they just said I had to figure out a way to get it in there. I misdiagnosed by a resident as well as a doctor for having an allergic reaction to antibiotic drops, which the resident doc actually TOOK an entire full bottle from me and did not return it because he believed I was allergic. Come to find out I had bacterial conjunctivitis and needed those drops, also I have no insurance and pay out-of-pocket for everything! I was then again misdiagnosed at every follow-up from the doctors telling me I have angry eye to a viral infection to this or that. They actually ended up spreading this infection from my injured eye to my uninjured eye from constantly testing my vision and having me place the plastic piece over one eye than the other and then the other again. I even told them i was prone to bacterial conjunction yet this still went wrongly diagnosed. My abrasion, which was 80% of my cornea, reopened about a week and a half later due to this misdiagnosed conjunctivitis and the subsequent swelling shut of my eye entirely. I couldn't open my eye at all for a MONTH. I was told not to cover it because that would cause bacteria to grow. Then after several visits to the ""best eye hospital"" I was so fed up I switched to Penn. It was like night and day. The corneal specialist actually took the time to show my mother how to get the gel into my eye, to teach me how to spread it around so it doesn't just fall out, and he finally taped my eye shut. After this my eye FINALLY began to heal and the pain became bearable and eventually dissipated. This lesson cost me more than a month of agony, several thousand dollars out of pocket, and so much time getting to and from the city from the far suburbs. I will never recommend this hospital to anyone and will make sure people know to beware that the place lives so well below its reputation.",2021-01-06 18:27:05,513,2507,

She never really answered that question just told me she would make it Beautiful. 

I started to say again do you have the red vase? And I got a dial tone?

She had hung up on me...

I called back and said seems we got disconnected, again I tried to ask her if she had the red vase that the flowers are pictured on her website..

She ten proceeded to give me a lecture...I said I want to know if you have the red vase that is pictured on your website...

Finally she said no but I can make it Beautiful I said I want the red vase with the flowers thank you I will find it somewhere else.

She hung up again on me.

SHE WAS TRYING TO SELL ME SOMETHING I DIDNT WANT.

I went to another florist I do business with and the bouquet was 10.00 cheaper and I went straight away and paid Cash for the bouquet to be delivered tomorrow.

Then I called back the owner of Flower Fantasy and told her she was very unprofessional, I found the bouquet I wanted 10.00 cheaper and I would Never Use her again Nor would I ever Refer her to Anyone!! 

Seems she has forgotten who the customer is and who pays for the service she provides.

Look else where before using this flower shop.

I had a record of mailing correct amount on January 3, 2021. We were charged a late fee which we paid for fear of wrecking our credit record. While on the phone with a representative I checked my in box for bills to be paid and realized I had not received my CENLAR mortgage bill, even though it was Jan 28, 2021 and bill was due Feb 1.

When I called back and asked where my February invoice was, I was told ""it was sent"". What kind of tricks are they playing. I am happy to pay my mortgage, but prefer to pay by mail - CENLAR makes it next to impossible. I do not have a cash flow problem - IF CENLAR WOULD SEND ME AN INVOICE!!!!!

End of November - Called them...where's our furniture?  They looked around and said the something in the warehouse had something somethinged and there weren't any left.  Next ones coming in mid-February.  I said this was unacceptable.

I moved away from the area before this LaScala's opened a few years ago, so I was excited to see that they had expanded their footprint into New Jersey. When I lived in Philly, I liked ordering delivery from LaScala's Pronto. I also recall a great flight at Birra in 2015 during beer week.

They're presently only offering electronic menus due to Covid, which is nice. We were seated right away and our friendly server was extremely patient while my mom tried to decide on a drink to order. I eventually asked if they could make her a French 75 off the menu, and the bartender agreed.

For my drink, I ordered the Blue Point Toasted Lager, which was only okay. For a restaurant with the word beer in it, I expected a better list. They should consider fluffing out the local selection, adding styles like sours, and perhaps even adding an Italian beer beyond peroni. I felt like their website was a little misleading on what to expect drink-wise.

But my critique ends there. The food more than made up for the lacking beer list. Oh my goodness!

My mom ordered the arancini app and I selected the ricotta board. I was torn between that and the fontina, but our server said the ricotta is their most popular app. I tried a bite of my mom's rice ball and it was great. But the ricotta with perfectly prepared bread?? Heaven. Pure bliss. I ate so much of it that I had to box up most of my pizza!

For my meal, I chose the alla carbonara pizza. Since I was super torn and wanted everything, I also ordered a four cheese pizza to go. My mom had the truffle pizza.

Verdict? All delicious but the four cheese stole the show. My mom even liked it better than her pizza, and she's the person who has always claimed to ""not like cheese.""

I also didn't want to pass up trying their dessert, so I ordered a slice of limoncello cake to go. Ate it later on and it too was delectable.

I would for sure return for their pizza when I'm in Jersey visiting family again. I so wanted to try the mac and cheese and the spinach and artichoke dip pizzas. Such inventive pies!",2021-01-01 18:13:21,470,2207,

This time, it's McCordsville that benefits as this location opens up at the end of a strip center in the same parking lot as the still fairly new Meijer just at the Indy/McCordsville city limits. 

This Noble Roman's follows the same rhythm and decor as other locations within the chain that first started in 1972 but only recently developed the ""Craft Pizza & Pub"" concept. 

You can order online and pick up curbside. Additionally, they do have a drive-up window where you can carry-out your orders. While I believe this location only opened in the last day or so, they were already doing a fairly decent business though much of it appeared to be carry-out. 

The interior appears to be a bit smaller than many Noble Roman's locations, though the set-up lends itself fairly easily to socially distanced dining. Employees were wearing masks. 

I tried to order online, but the website kept trying to send it through the Carmel location. I finally got frustrated and just went inside. I sat very well distanced from everyone in a corner of the restaurant and actually got in some needed reading time. 

Unlike the location in Fishers, this one seems to be offering table service if you're dining in. You can definitely tell they're still working out the bugs in their systems, but the employees were friendly, helpful, and I have no doubt those bugs will get worked out. 

This is a new strip center. It looks to have maybe 3-4 other retail spots with only one other taken - a Verizon store. It has accessible parking and curb cuts. Like Most Noble Roman's locations, there's a two-sided glass door and a narrow aisle (with social distance markings) toward the host/ordering area. There's also a bar area and televisions throughout playing everything from sports to silent films. 

Also unlike Fishers, I did not have to get my own drink. I also appreciated that. They have both tables and booths - I always appreciate it when I'm offered an option. While logic dictates I prefer a table and stay in my wheelchair, there are days that getting out of the chair is nice. 

It did not appear they would be having any outdoor dining even when warmer, but that's just a guess based upon the space. That could change. 

I ordered a fairly standard Noble Roman's order for me - an individual-sized sausage pizza, deep dish. I also ordered garlic bread and my usual unsweetened iced tea. The bill came to about $13 without a tip (Yes, I did tip. Quit rolling your eyes). 

I find Noble Roman's to be remarkably consistent and I was definitely happy with the meal. I'll no doubt return. I sort of stumbled across this location as I'd headed out to visit a coffee shop that ended up being closed. Driving home, I spotted Noble Roman's and thought pizza sounded amazing. 

They use King Arthur Brand flour. They have 40 topping options. They offer salads, pasta options, and baked sandwiches. They have a variety of side items. Of course, they do have beer and a craft root beer tap. 

I was delighted to stumble across this great new addition to the McCordsville restaurant landscape. It's relatively close to my home and probably the closest location to me other than possibly Fishers. So, there's simply no doubt I'll be returning.",2021-01-02 22:19:03,669,3363,

Somewhere in the midst of syntax and sentiment, those words always seem to ring true for this angler, 45 years on this journey and most of them plying the nearshore with a rod in my hands.

Goleta pier is, perhaps, one location that most elicits those feelings-- for more than 20 years, it has been my ""home pier,"" fully 130 miles from my doorstep, but never too far for a casual evening visit.

A few weeks ago, my youngest son saw my old hoop nets leaning against the garage wall, and told me that for his 7th birthday, he wanted to catch a crab. Between distance learning, distance principaling, and a move to a new home, the thought of getting out on a pier was a refreshing notion. And so, my wife and I loaded up the truck with kids and gear, and started north on the 101. After a quick stop at In N Out, we arrived at Goleta Beach Park. Fearing the worst, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the park and the pier were clean and improved: the restrooms were in good working order, pier railings were replaced, and the lights were upgraded from sodium halide orange to LED soft white.
We enjoyed our dinner at the picnic tables, not far from the site of several Goleta Get-Togethers with fishing buddies over the years. I breathed a few heavy sighs remembering old friends who have moved away or moved on to higher planes, but all with a smile on my face.

We set up a few crab hoops from the bend to the crane on the reef side, and threw in two hi-lo rigs with sardine chunks for good measure. One of the more glorious sunsets I've seen in a while created a gorgeous backdrop for our family adventure.

The action was slow but steady on small (sub legal) rock crabs, decorator crabs, and one big spider crab to round out the variety. The birthday boy was ecstatic, of course, and even added a couple of white croaker for good measure.

I found myself looking down the pier for old friends a few times, but only saw other folks enjoying a relatively warm winter evening.

As for me and my family, we enjoyed our 260 mile turn around trip immensely, and my walk down memory lane has stayed with me all week: running's  ""pier fishing school"" years ago as a service project; catching all sorts of fish, crabs, and lobsters in the company of friends; nights of solitude with only the stars to keep me company. I was so glad to visit Goleta, even if only for a few hours to reminisce about more than two decades. It proved once again that while our piscatorial pursuits serve the purpose of catching (and if we choose, releasing) critters of the sea, there is so much more to the pastime.

We started off by ordering guacamole and salsa. I usually don't like it when I have to pay for salsa, but if it's good I don't mind as much. They literally served it to us in a TOGO ramekin and charged us $5...worst part was they didn't even bother to refill it...that was a rip off. The guacamole was ok, nothing groundbreaking.

I ordered a margarita and that was an even bigger rip off. It was $12, served in a cup you would find in a cafeteria, and I finished it in 3 sips. That margarita should have been $5 at most. 

The tacos are actually pretty good. I especially enjoyed the fish tacos and I like how they used corn tortillas. However, my boyfriend cannot eat corn tortillas as it hurts his stomach. So he asked our server if they had flour tortillas, and our server got a little defensive. I don't think that was her intention but she could have had a better response to his question. 

The atmosphere is very nice and open with plenty of seating. It's nice on a cool, crisp night. 

We were a bit astonished when we got the check. They charge a full 20% gratuity on the whole bill. We tip 20% or more about 95% of the time but it was kind of a slap in the face considering we spent $100 and still left hungry.

This hospital is worth the drive and they are AAHA certified which is worth every penny in my mind. I spent a lot of time researching and looking for the best hospital for my exotic pets, specifically my two, new lion-head rabbits. Acacia animal hospital is filled with friendly staff who aren't bothered by the dozens of questions I had for them, being a new rabbit owner.

I cannot speak highly enough of Dr. Laudonio and his staff. Dr. Laudonio took so much time to answer all my questions, explain everything in detail and just continually confirmed my suspicion that this hospital is the best one for my bunnies. They made sure the bunnies were comfortable and well socialized (I.e. receiving lots of cuddles from staff!) during their visit which made me feel great since due to COVID I couldn't go inside with them. 

I spoke with several different technicians from making the appointments to checking in and out and every single one of them was helpful, efficient and so kind. 

My rabbits are going to receive the absolute best care from Dr. Laudonio and his staff. He absolutely knows what he is doing when it comes to rabbit and other exotic animal care, as does his amazing staff.

On another note, I fully intend to bring my rosy boa and my crested gecko to this hospital if they ever need medical attention.

I have visited this location many times and always book the same service, the ""talk of the town"" luxe pedicure.

No other customers showed up during my service and the other customer remained sitting less than 2' from me for about 30 minutes before leaving. Zero social distancing, VERY disappointing and uncomfortable.

I noticed a bit into my service not only that my technician never changed gloves after her last service, but I'm also fairly sure she used the same tools from the client she finished next to me. In the middle of my service, while she had a hot towel on my legs, she rolled over and sprayed/wiped down the other station and collected the old towels. I had to ask her to switch gloves after she did so. 

Further, my service did not include many of the treatments in the description- no scrub, no foot peel, no wax and my service lasted just over 30 minutes (it's described as being a 1 hour service).

When COVID hit, the team at Sit! Stay! Play! was proactive and did everything to address the health, safety, and well-being of everyone. They were truly amazing and the fact we could still work and know our dogs were safe was so appreciated.

Janet, Emily and the entire team is just incredible. We moved back to CA in the Summer of 2019 and definitely miss taking our dogs to Sit! Stay! Play! Thanks for all the wonderful care of my babies.",2021-01-04 18:46:03,350,1603,

I have been to all locations and I hated this one the most. It's only getting two stars cause our waitress was nice. Came here for my brother's birthday and everything started out good. The greatest tasting thing here was the biscuits and apple butter. But how would one mess that up. The mushrooms and wedges were good as well. Now when we get to our food, whoo chile. My husband had the brisket sandwich with potato salad. He said he liked his meal and nothing was wrong except the potato salad had a slightly weird taste. I had the burger, which was alright. They piled a lot of melted Swiss cheese on which I thought was weird, and the burger was a bit too done. The fries I liked cause again, how would you mess up fries? My mom, brother, and sister had the pick 2/3 meats dinner. They hated all the meat they had chosen; wings, rib tips, ribs, etc. the sides were also not too great. The greens and green beans were sweet as hell. Who does that? The Mac n cheese, horrible. Which I don't trust any restaurant Mac n cheese so Idk why they even got it. My other sister had the chicken salad and the dressing completely ruined her salad and to make things worse, the chicken was nasty and dry. I have never had a bad experience till I came to this location. My mom also talked to the manager who was rude trying to justify the food. Even if the food is fresh, if it's cooked wrong, too dry, no taste, etc. then it doesn't matter if it's the freshest food in the world. Like girl, we all gonna pay for what we ate, but take the stuff off that was all wrong and not edible.

The food, without question, stole the show.  If you are reading this, the restaurant is usually available to members only.  I'm not sure how long it'll be open to the public, so take advantage of this while you can. 

View - Best in the city
Atmosphere - Elegant, up to date
Service - Topnotch, start to finish.  Chef came out, GM checked on us and our waitress was fantastic
Drinks - Nice selection, started with champaign and then each had a cocktail - I went with a Manhattan and my wife enjoyed a Peach Cosmo  
FOOD - Skyline Brussels Sprouts, Pan Seared Sea Scallops, Asian Grilled Lamb Chops, Crushed Potatoes.  The brussels sprouts were quite possibly the best I've ever had...and when on any menu, I order.  Cooked to perfection with a chili honey glaze spread over goat cheese.  The crushed potatoes were delicious but as the only basic item ordered, got lost in the shuffle.  We brought most of the potatoes home as leftovers and created a breakfast dish the next day that was phenomenal.  As far as the main courses, we haven't stopped talking about them.  The Pan Seared Sea Scallops dish was incredible and the thoughtfulness of the plating and pairings with corn puree, risotto, bacon and blackberry reduction made it memorable.  The surprise of the night came with the Asian Grilled Lamb Chops.  No words can do this justice and I thank the waitress for introducing this as a popular selection.  Soy glazed with stir fried veggies and a cilantro mint sauce.  3 lamb chop lollipops, which can't be an easy item to properly cook, were handled by the chef with perfection.  I've ordered this dish from a few high-end restaurants and have never left a review or raved to friends about the experience.

We've been fortunate to dine at some great restaurants and we both agree, this is now a favorite.  Do yourself a favor and take in the views of the city, enjoy a cocktail and trust the Chef and his team to handle the rest.

This review is for the new funeral director rather than the facility itself. I dealt with Andrew Winterkorn at the Curlew Hills location. He not only forgot to fingerprint my mother but lied about it after. He messed up my Dad's death certificate and had the audacity to say that it would be fine. My lawyer said absolutely not! Also added fees onto the agreement after I signed it which I have refused to pay. All in all, stay away!!!!! This is gross negligence and you should beware of dealing with him. His supervisor at Curlew Hills is no better. Avoid both locations or make sure that you keep track of every detail and keep good receipts. Three screw ups is far too many in my book!!!!

When we first walked in, the environment was very chill, warm, and welcoming. The greeter treated as if we were old friends. We got seated pretty quickly. The server was very patient with us as we were very indecisive. Ultimately I ended up with the Paradise French Toast and Belgian Bird with a cup of black coffee. 

The coffee had no acidic after taste and went down smoothly. Perfect for a groggy, cold and gloomy morning to help you pick up your day. 

The Paradise French Toast was soft, creamy and mildly sweet. This was perfect for my liking as I am not a fan of overly sweet things. The fruit brought a pop of taste into the mix. The butter was surprisingly light and not too overbearing. I believe that that mixed heavy whipping cream into it which allowed it to have such a fluffy texture. Even as leftovers, it was amazing. 

The Belgian Bird is a heavy dish but was not overly powering. The waffle was soft but crispy. It paired really well with the chicken that was well breaded. The chicken was a bit on the drier side but nothing that couldn't be balanced out with the jalapeño syrup. The jalapeño syrup took me back by surprise as I was not expecting such a kick. It was a pleasant kick thought. 

Overall, this restaurant was fantastic with excellent food and service. I would highly recommend checking this restaurant out if you are in the area. I hope to be back sometime again.",2021-01-05 13:25:17,303,1486,

I seek out this experience as much as possible! Up until recently I had never heard of manakeesh, a Middle Eastern flatbread that is served quite a lot like a pizza. The place to try it in Edmonton? Sunbake Pita Bakery in Rosslyn. CBC Edmonton's Best Restaurants 2019 named the bakery as one of the Best Restaurants North of the Core. I looked forward to venturing to the north side to taste something new!

The bakery itself is a very casual establishment located in a strip mall. I was quite pleased to see that every single business in the strip mall was a Middle Eastern shop or restaurant - a very good sign that this is the right place for the most authentic cuisine offerings. The store is large and unmistakable with its bright yellow and red signage. Inside you'll mainly find a counter to order from and you'll likely be dazzled (like I was) by the extensive nut bar to the left of the room. The space is clean and neatly organized with bright green walls. I visited the beverage cooler to the right of the the counter first, always interested in finding imported beverages. With a wide array of choices, I settled on a Vimto, a drink that I have enjoyed in the past. I like this carbonated beverage because it tastes like fruit punch except fizzy. What's not to like? It's super popular in Middle Eastern countries and therefore is a perfect match for the food that I was about to consume.

The menu is presented on screens and I wanted to do my best to order a good sampling of their food. The main thing at Sunbake Pita is the tannour pita bread. Sunbake Pita can produce 3,000 loaves per hour and they claim to be the only bakery in North America capable of doing so. Using this specific type of flatbread they make manakeesh, which is certainly the main thing on their menu. This popular item consists of tannour pita topped with various combinations of meats, cheese, veggies and spices. (Of which Sunbake only uses Halal meat and fresh vegetables.) It can be sliced or folded. It's similar to a pizza but with a different type of bread and without sauce. The main one that I was excited to try was the Zaatar Cheese Manakeesh ($5.25) because I'd heard that it's one of their best ones. Upon ordering, the man at the counter (who was very helpful) asked if I would like my manakeesh sliced (like a pizza) or folded in half. I inquired which was the best way to eat it and he recommended folding it - no arguing with that! Served piping hot straight from the oven, this pita situation was incredibly oily because of the cheese - but in the best possible way. The soft, fresh dough was crisped in an oven, creating the perfect combination of chewiness and crunch. Inside was a simple yet delightful combination of melty and somewhat caramelized cheese (which I'm pretty sure was just a marble cheddar) and za'atar spice. This spice mixture is typically made up of dried thyme, oregano, marjoram, toasted sesame seeds and salt. Incredibly fragrant and flavourful, I loved the zingy kick from the spices and detected something almost citrus-acidic about the combination. The spice is quite dense, more or less made into a paste, which really stands up to the cheese and pita, never allowing any of the flavour to be lost. I found this to be an incredibly special item unlike anything that I've ever tasted before. Apparently this particular combination is typically eaten for breakfast and I can see it being an amazing way to begin the day.

The menu consists of different categories of manakeesh; meat, veggie, ultimate, and chicken. I figured that ordering something from the meat section would help to round out my experience. So I chose the Meat Pie Manakeesh ($3.99), which sounded like their most straight-up meat version. Again, I had it folded in half as per the recommendation. I have absolutely no idea what kind of meat is used. Possibly lamb? The pita itself was just as perfectly baked as the previous one however this one contained a very flavourful mixture of meaty goodness. It tasted almost sausage-like and was well seasoned. This manakeesh was heavier and bolder. I enjoyed it as something that could serve as more of a meal.

I was surprised to find a Chicken Shawarma Wrap ($8.50 for regular) on the menu. Chicken shawarma is widely available in southern Ontario, however is less so in the west. Especially in Edmonton where the donair reigns supreme, you don't come across chicken shawarma all that often. So to find it on this menu was very exciting for me and I had to try it. Upon ordering, I was not asked which toppings I wanted (which is typical practice in most shawarma shops). Nope, Sunbake Pita was going to make this shawarma their way - and I were going to like it. Made with the same delicious tannour pita, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. I personally loved that I wasn't given any choice in the toppings because I honestly prefer when so",2021-01-19 18:37:11,1006,5000,

Bottom line: If you want to get your skis serviced in a timely manner, go somewhere else because this place doesn't have its systems in order to keep their timing promises + I hope you are also comfortable with slack mask-wearing discipline during COVID. 

Broken Customer Promises:
1. Broken Promise 1 - Failed to Keep to Servicing Schedule: Turned in skis for rush servicing with promises of next business day completion. The next business day, I was informed my skis would be 3 days late.
2. Broken Promise 2 - Failed to Keep Customer Service Remediation Promise: I was promised that to make amends for the lateness, they would ship my skis to me after service (I live 2 hours away - hence I requested a rush). When I called, they backtracked on the promise. 

Other Issues:
1. It was very blatantly obvious that one of the more senior store staff that interacted with customers struggled to keep his mask on. Occasionally it was on, but it was most often off (as in mouth and nose open). The rest of the staff kept their mask on and had no issues. 
2. There was mass confusion of where lines were and where to go for specific services (paying, seeking product advice, ski servicing) and etc. People were standing around waiting for service.

Deeper Operations Problems:
I stood around long enough to overhear an interesting conversation between the staff and customers about the store's issues. Apparently, there are two digitally tracking systems for ski servicing that don't talk to each other. So although everyone is supposed to get an automated text and email, its very easy to fall in between the cracks (like me), if it is input in the wrong system. The staff was consistently checking between the two data systems, an easy point of mistakes and inefficiency. 

The Staff is Great Though:
While I was standing around, I did see lots of friendly and caring staff helping people find the best gear. They seemed like lovely people. However, they were clearly overwhelmed and clearly sagged with bad systems + management struggles. 

Final Thoughts: I hate to sandbag a small business with so much history in the community, but they really did me wrong. I had to spend $300 (in extra travel and lodging costs since I was from out of town visiting family) + adjusted my winter plans because a business could not keep their word. I also canceled visiting family out of an abundance of caution after interacting with the non-mask wearing customer service person. Thanks Buckman's.",2021-01-03 04:39:00,513,2598,

In addition to all these wonderful things, normally (but now closed for Covid) they Would have fitness facilities as well, laundry facilities available, and even an on-site bar that is still working during Covid!! They are open and taking precautions And only serving one customer at a time.  

Hotel McCoy has a nice heated saltwater pool with lovely facilities and ample towels and even a little island with an umbrella in the center! The murals around the entire property are to die for and the layout is really cute. They even have a gift shop with really cute items as well as some coffee table books I might want to come back and buy.  

Each room has a different theme and there are many large and small murals that are fascinating all over the property.  I included some photos!

For the most part, everyone has been very friendly. However, since COVID, things have seemed to go a little downhill. I understand why they are not allowing people inside the building until their appointment time,  but last time I was there I was left waiting outside for almost 1.5 hours after my appointment was to start. It's not easy standing outside with two dogs with no where to sit for 1.5 hours. 
When we do finally see the doc, they are friendly enough, but I'm always left in awe of how much money I've spent and I never really know what it is for, even after I ask clarifying questions. Labs for this, tests for that, etc. I don't think I've ever left that building without spending $400. If you are looking for something cheap or low-cost, definitely look elsewhere.
I would also be very careful if scheduling a dental procedure. I was told on the phone that dental is about $600-$650 (already very expensive), and then when my dog was all said it done, it was about $1400. This was due to ""necessary"" tooth extractions that I had apparently agreed to. I understand sometimes that teeth need to be removed and maybe the price would go up a little, but my God, you think you could warn someone when their bill is going to be $800 dollars more than the already expensive quoted price??

I do understand the place is slightly pricey than others but the amount of food you get, variety , quality and taste is perfect and totally worth it.

We were here Saturday night and had reservations upfront. We were seated immediately outside in their covered area with heaters. They have only one option which is pre-fixed. You can order some apps or customize meats but basically the idea is the table gets a plate of Salatum (apps), entree and desert of the day. We got a plate of of Salatum i.e. multiple small apps(tapas) with pita. The hostess explained each app and its contents.  Took her like 5mins to complete everything.  We did order drinks. Cocktails were unique and tasted well. Salatum was delicious and pita bread was fabulous.  You can request more Salatum as needed. All apps were veg with unique flavors. I cannot stop raving abt their pita. For entree, we ordered lamb kofta and ribeye beef. Lamb was delicious, well cooked. Beef was over cooked so they replaced with rare. I like mine medium. But, the meat was very well seasoned and tasted delicious. 

For desert, we got sesame cookies and hit chocolate. Love love live the cookies. Hostess gave us gluten-free for home for free. But the original one much better. Too bad they don't sell it.

They were a very small portion and since they were on special they didn't come with any sides (I wasn't told this I guess he assumed we knew). They were also cold. We tried a bite and didn't eat the rest. 
I got the grilled salmon salad which was delicious. I asked for dressing on the side but there was a pool of it in the bottom of my bowl anyways, which I didn't really understand. My friend had a burger and was immediately turned off that he couldn't pick the temp it was cooked, but it is a quick service type restaurant so he got over it.  It was also cold when it came out but the flavors were ok enough. The fries were good. 
He got the cobbler - served cold with no ice cream. I'm not sure if the people working just thought this was how to do it or if it's how PDK always does it, but we are in the south and that's not how you serve cobbler. 
I got the banana pudding shot. It was good, enough. I would say Jim N Nicks blows there's out of the water but it wasn't bad. 

Covid - they have markers on tables that have been cleaned. There was only 2 other people eating in when we were there (on a Wed night) so distancing was easy.

First things first, the guy taking the order was nothing less than RUDE. I made him  aware that it was first time and asked what would he recommend. He gave some options. Then, as I was deciding between the lobster roll and the BLT he said ""I told you, the lobster roll is the popular pick."" Not ""I told you"" like yay rah pick that one. More like, ""you're disturbing me...hurry up and order!"" Kind of way. Meh. 

We order the BLT, lobster roll and shrimp Mac and cheese. 

It wasn't anything special. I have it 3 stars instead of two because the spicy sauce they drizzle on top was the best thing they had!! I went back and asked for a cup of it lol. I used to dip my fries in and added flavor to the lobster roll. When I did go back to the counter to request that, a different guy was way more pleasant! He should've been the greeter guy! 

The seafood is COLD. I didn't read the reviews and felt rushed to read the menu so I wasn't aware of this. But this is something I would have like to known prior. The put cold seafood on hot buns and Mac lol. 

Out of the 3 things, the BLT WAS THE BEST. Skip the Mac and cheese at all cost. The lobster roll was edible if you add the yummy drizzle. Fries are delicious!

Both my handicapped In-laws needed to use the restroom since we were traveling to Mt. Lemon. We stopped in and decided to Purchase drinks, donuts  and I believe some cheese and bacon sandwiches. My father in law asked a Dunkin Donut staff member where the bathrooms were and he was told that they were closed for Covid. He came back to the car and told me about it. I did not believe it so I went into the restaurant lobby and noticed that the pathway to the restrooms was semi blocked with what I believe to be a trash receptacle. I  asked the young lady behind the register where the employees go to the restroom when they need to go? She said we use the bathrooms but the Owner wants them closed to customers. I informed her that both my handicapped family members needed to use the restroom. She denied me again while saying she was sorry. I informed her that If they serve food and drink and allow people to dine in they must open their bathrooms. After the third time me mentioning this the young lady asked if I wanted to speak with the manager. I said yes, and a few minutes later I was talking to the MOD. The MOD told me that the young lady behind the counter was right but that they would never deny anyone from using the bathroom. I answered but I was denied! Twice! The MOD told me that its so difficult trying to keep up with all the Covid rules and that they had just had a health review and they said it was ok to close the bathrooms but she would still allow me to use them. I let her know that if they were going to allow people to dine in their restaurant they needed to have a restroom available to them (I pointed at a different party eating their purchases).  I let her know I didn't have to use them but my elderly, Handicapped in-laws needed to. I took  mental note of the trash bin that had to be moved to unblock the pathway because my mother-in-law could definitely not squeeze her way through. I asked her what she wanted to do and she said she wanted to go to a different restroom. We drove up the street to a CVS and she was able to use the restroom without any problems, apparently they must not fall under the same Covid regulations.

We arrived at 6:45pm and didn't expect it to be so jammed packed. The restaurant is located in a residential area and there just was not enough parking for the amount of people there. We had to drive in circles for 17 minutes, just to find a spot. We even witnessed a fender bender on our quest. 

Once inside you are immediately greeted by a host stand and a beautiful lit up bar. All of the staff seemed to be wearing face masks, but seating was not spread out. Unfortunately, they do not take call a heads or reservations so there was an expected wait. The bar was full but the bartender noticed us and offered us drinks while we waited. About 15 minutes pass -- we are seated in the outdoor section of the restaurant. It was clean, and beautifully decorated, giving an Aztec feel. The outdoor bar was nice but not as big was the one inside. 

Our table was in the corner, but very close to other tables around us. The seats were very low and uncomfortable for some. It took our waitress 10 minutes just to greet us, and another 15 to get us waters. I order the drinks which were four peach and blueberry  -5 degree tequila shots and a crown and sprite. They arrived at 7:45pm, and made up for the time waited. They were absolutely delicious. A nice size pour and went down super smooth. The cinnamon sprinkled orange chaser, made it uniquely perfect. On the other hand the crown and sprite was very watered down (you could tell it either had been forgotten about at the bar or the sprite went out). 

We finally order our food at 8:00pm. I ordered the Poblano taco, Mahi Tropical Taco and Lobster Taco it arrives at 8:22pm. Surprisingly, The poblano taco was the spiciest of the three but was very good. I just wish they drained the juices from the mushroom. It made my tortilla soggy before I could even eat it. Mahi Tropical was just that; topped with a mango salsa, and crema. It was a good one to choose from. My favorite being the lobster taco, super fresh and a nice amount of lobster. I wish I ordered two of them!

Overall, The service made this experience a not so great one. The food was good but nothing to rave about. Parking needs some work.",2021-01-21 19:35:53,465,2222,

I promise I've really tried to like it but unfortunately the poor experiences outweigh the good. The biggest issue is the inconsistency in hours; it's not uncommon for the door to be locked when the hours posted on Instagram and yelp say it should be open.

Most recently I walked up at 9:20pm on a Saturday as a couple was just leaving with their shakes. When I got to the door, an employee met me there and told me they were closed. According to yelp and Instagram, they close at 10 on Saturdays. I get taking some liberty with flexibility of hours during the winter when you sell ice cream, but this seemed really strange since they obviously had a flow of customers and hadn't cleaned machines yet. With an ice cream shop in the Bottleworks garage now directly across the street, it's getting pretty easy to take business elsewhere so hopefully this changes soon.

I was super excited to see the menu state that the chocolate covered strawberry milkshake came with an actual chocolate covered strawberry on top, but when I've ordered it, it actually comes with a syrupy slice of strawberry topping and Hershey's syrup/sprinkled chocolate chips on top. Just false advertising.

As other reviews state, the price is steep and it also feels pretty unfair that there is only one size for milkshakes. It creates a ton of waste as most adults can't even finish a whole one, let alone kids. And this made for a huge hot, sticky, dairy mess all over this section of the Cultural Trail all summer long as the trash can repeatedly overflowed by night fall. Hopefully this summer the business can provide some extra trash cans for the area.",2021-01-17 02:58:16,331,1690,

The service was awesome! I failed to get our server's name (that's on me), but he was incredibly energetic, helpful, and friendly. I'd give him 5 stars. He's the only reason this isn't a 1 star review.

First, the restaurant was packed. No attempt at social distancing. I get that it's not legally required, but I guess I would have hoped they would be at least a little concerned about the safety of their patrons. Live and learn.

I ordered a salad with blue cheese dressing.  The dressing was watered down!  Disgusting. Had no blue cheese taste.  It was not creamy at all. Especially disturbing since it's always been so good in the past.

I also had au gratin potatoes. A few of the potatoes were under-cooked and the cheese was tasteless. Again, always been superb in the past.

I also ordered a steak. I was very pleased with the steak.  It was cooked to perfection, juicy, and very flavorful. They added steak butter which just added to the deliciousness.

In case you think I'm just overly critical, this is the report of one of my guests:

Also ordered a salad with blue cheese.  Said exactly the same! Ate only a couple bites.

Also had au gratin potatoes and felt they were bland.

She ordered Chicken with provel cheese, white wine garlic sauce with broccoli and mushrooms. She'd had this in the past and was looking forward to enjoying it again.  Again, she couldn't finish it and wouldn't take it home.  Said it was bland.

Spent over $60 and the only food that was enjoyed was a 6 oz steak.

Won't be back until COVID pandemic is over. Will try again at that time.  Hopefully they'll be back to being all-around awesome.",2021-01-17 04:39:57,381,1756,
rhpE77sjbqXgHd4g8KYYzQ,-nHUAn6IfY2U-Joq7CuLEQ,B65v5G8kMbOz16YdLITHcA,5,5,4,5,"The night started with Larb salad.  From the Issan (border with Laos) tradition of Thai cuisine, it is not really a green leafy salad, but more a meat and greens salad.  It is a wonderful way to start your meal along with possibly som tam (Green Papaya Salad).  Both som tam and larb share a certain spiceness which can be adjusted.  There are times when we just order one of each for a dinner for two.  Both come with a generous bowl of white rice at this place.

The minced pork is wonderfully seasoned with fish sauce, chili flakes, lime juice, thinly sliced red onion, toasted sticky rice to give it some crunchy texture and a wonderful assortment of fresh herbs (like basil) to bring it all together.  The pork (or chicken or beef) is piled high atop iceberg lettuce and sliced cucumbers.  The spiciness (heat) of the pork is offset with the coolness and crunch of the lettuce/cucumber bed.  Requesting pork will give you the chewiness and porkiness that really separates it from beef or chicken.  This version is a ONE pepper on the heat scale at this restaurant, but it can be toned down to mild on request.  For those who have not experienced Larb or   Som Tam, this would be a perfect place to sample it.  Start with the toned down setting on the heat.  Two thumbs up on this dish.

Another dish we had was the Pad Thai only because that is the most ordered dish by non-Asian people.  After many visits to Bangkok and Chiang Mai in Thailand, there is no spice level or dish we have not tasted.  I prefer the dish to cause my eyes to water and my forehead to break out in a sweat when the item is just placed on the table.  That happens in Thailand from just the vapor released from a proper spicy dish.  This pad thai was not spicy, but was acceptable and average.  Simple, good flavor, but nothing life-altering.

The final dish was Pad Kee Mao which is flat noodles and we got the shrimp as the protein along with a 3 peppers rating on their scale of 1-5 at this establishment.  The big noodles are more capable of absorbing the peppers than the more delicate other dishes.  A level of 3 peppers brought it up to the level of 1 pepper with the larb.  It was a very tasty dish with a delicious sauce.

Chiang Mai House will get more of our business as we venture through more of the menu.",2021-01-28 02:02:34,473,2298,

First started in 1965, the year I was born, I grew up enjoying Clancy's due to my family's mad love for the place. If I remember right, it was a Plainfield location - or it might have simply been on Rockville Road. I can still remember the building and the burgers. 

I was honestly a little stunned when I heard that Clancy's would have a location inside Bottleworks. It appears to be their 2nd location at this point - here's hoping this means a resurgence is coming. 

The very first Clancy's was in Noblesville. It was always a place that made you feel like they weren't cutting corners. Clancy's technically was fast food, but it was a different sort of place. Being that the character Clancy was based upon a cartoon character, it always carried with it a sort of nostalgia. 

Can you tell I'm reminiscing? 

What about now? The Garage Food Hall is a pretty nifty place. Each restaurant in the Hall has their own location with a few tables, though given current pandemic guidelines you may need to look around a bit - I did. They have a mix of taller tables and shorter tables. Since I'm in a wheelchair, I obviously needed a shorter table and ended up having to go to the other side of the Hall to find one. 

The Clancy's menu includes their famous burgers along with a Beyond Plant-Based Burger, a Clancy's Topper (don't think Big Mac - way better!), flat-top franks, some chicken selections, multiple variations of fries, some sides, shakes, and a variety of beverages. You can get your sandwiches as a meal and you can do things like double up the burger ($3 extra) or get a large drink instead of a medium. 

I ordered a double-burger with fries and a large unsweetened iced tea. My meal came in at just over $12. The burger was fresh. It's made from angus beef and on a brioche rolla. It was delicious and substantial. The french fries were nicely seasoned - perhaps a little bit on the light side in terms of a side, but not bad and definitely tasty. My iced tea was also terrific. 

Masks were required and all employees were masked (you obviously took masks off to eat). Bottleworks has an active cleaning crew. I left the table once to go get ice cream and when I came back a couple minutes later my table was already clean. 

The young woman working the counter today, whose name I didn't get, was an absolute delight - super friendly and helpful. 

Oh, and they also do have a rewards program that you can sign up for with your first order. It's pretty quick and painless. Parking in their lot is paid. I actually parked at one of the Mass Avenue meters and wheeled around. Everything is pretty wheelchair friendly. The doorway is a double-sided glass door and all of the sidewalks are new and have appropriate curb cuts. The parking lot has accessible parking. I did struggle a bit with carrying my food (no trays), but that's likely a safety precaution in a pandemic world. I could deal with it and did. 

Overall, this is probably somewhere between a 4-5 star but I'm trending upward because of the terrific service, warm nostalgia, safety precautions, and I just plain enjoyed my meal in a pleasant environment. Tables were nicely distanced and everything felt safe and respectful. 

There's simply no doubt I'll be back. While I do want to try some of the other Hall options, I'm already looking forward to a return trip to Clancy's.

Started off my lease with issues with management after they implied, in the lease contract, that our apartment would come equipped with furniture- a tiny 2 BR/1 BA that we are paying WAY too much for. However, after I signed the lease agreement, they told me that there would be no furniture included in the apartment. They knew it was a breach of contract, so at the last second, to cover themselves, they provided about (maybe) $40 worth of barely usable, poor quality furniture that we decided not to use because it was actually dangerous to use (whole other story). Management was extremely unprofessional and the property manager I had to go through could not communicate with me in a respectful, adult-like and professional manner, so there was basically nothing I could do. Not even sure how she, the property manager, still has a job. 
Then, many issues later, our lease is up and my roommates and I all get COVID, so we need to quarantine for 10 days (even though our lease is up in 3 days) so we ask if we can please stay for an extra week and we'll pay a weeks worth of rent in exchange (which is basically the remaining of our savings). But, that wasn't enough for them, and demanded we agree to a 2 week extension paying half a month's worth of rent- or they kick us out when our lease expires. Knowing we were all unemployed from work shutdowns due to covid with no unemployment money, we are all living off of our very limited savings, and simply cannot afford to stay for 2 extra weeks. But they didn't care, and threatened to kick us out of the apartment if we did not sign the 2 week extension agreement. Not to mention, halfway through the last month of our lease, they had contacted us multiple times, continually asking us to extend our lease by several months. They offered to negotiate a lower price, but we voiced our financial difficulties and had to decline. However, when we were diagnosed with COVID, their willingness to cut a deal flew out the window. Even with 4 people infected with COVID, showing very severe symptoms of a deadly disease, they only care about squeezing every dollar they can get out of you. 
Am yet to have a decent encounter with them.

Grant you this was our first time going out to eat in over 6 months. I know things have changed with carona but everything was bad. Start off did not feel welcomed when I walked in the hostess seemed like she was overwhelmed and just did not want to be there. I asked if they had outside dining she said no and I now know why. That was the staffs playground while we were waiting at any given time there was 5 to 7 staff members out there doing what ever they wanted. Once we were seated we were placed right by the door going to the out side dining and it was a revolving door as staff came in and out blasting us with cold air. It would be different if there were other guests out there but just staff doing what ever they wanted. Took a long time for the waitress to come get drink orders. We got our drinks ordered dinner i got steak and ribs wife got steak. Really disappointed they no longer serve mac and cheese that was the best things they had. We waited quite a while for our salads and drink refills. Our salads came with our dinner the waitress did give us refills and that was the last time we saw her. Both our steaks were chewy and under cooked my ribs we not very good. We would have complain but no one ever came back to check on us. Every time I asked one of the employees the would go in and out of the door they would say let me get your waitress but to no eval. We both didn't not eat our food and at one point another employee gave us boxes and told us to pay on that point of sales thing on the table. We said screw it walked out and ate at in and out.

The owner and her mother are the ultimate professionals when it comes to owning and operating a business. My Brownies were utterly amazing they were a true brownie. They weren't like a cake they were thick rich and moist.  I also requested nuts and I wasn't disappointed i got full chunky walnuts not slivers of nuts.  I'm going to say an important part of business is if you make a mistake its not how bad the mistake its how as an owner operator its handled. The owner herself herself is an inspiration to young women everywhere. To her advantage she has a bonus and that's her Mother to help her take her businessto the next level. You can tell the love she pours into her food. You can tell it's not just a job for this owner operator it's her passion. This mother daughter duo is fantastic heartfelt professional and spiritually lead which will bring nothing but prosperity to this business. I'm honor to tell anyone this a GREAT place to spend your money. Place your order today guys its so worth it and the welcoming service you get when you step into this establishment is worth everything. I can't tell you the Taste Tester's name but she was a joy.

I mean really, who ever wakes up and goes ""you know what would be good... a spaghetti burrito."" and then sets out to get one.  (And this is coming from someone who routinely eats spaghetti sandwiches... don't ask.)

I'm here to tell you that while you might not ever WANT this, you owe it to yourself to at least try it.   This fast casual concept place from the makers of Bavaro's Pizza popped up on my radar and I decided to give it a try.   

It's a quick option for anyone who needs a quick hit of their scratch kitchen style of Italian food.  You come in, order in a tablet, then eat your food.  

I don't even remember what the proper name of the Spaghetti Burrito was... but you'll find it in the tablet.  It comes in both Spaghetti and Meatball, and Chicken Parm form with a side of whatever sauce you'd like.  (I went with the red because I was already way out of my comfort zone.). 

I also added a ceasar salad to the side which I'm happy to report holds up on its own thanks to the great hand crafted ceaser dressing they put on it.   

Both items were great and fresh and i'm also pleasantly surprised to not feel too bogged down after scraping down the copious amount of carbs.  

If you're looking for something quick, new, and Italian, this is definitely the place to try.  Definitely would like to see a few more of these places pop up, and kudos to the owners for trying a new concept that actually kinda works out pretty well for what it's meant to be!",2021-01-16 20:53:46,326,1500,

Never seen anything like it. Which is sad. Starting taking my pets here because it was a ""low cost"" vet. Both of my animals were neutered/spayed here when they were kittens. So my one cat has dental problems. Has since he was 3. Took him there for a supposed ""tumor"" in his mouth over a year ago. Took him in for a regular exam they didn't see a tumor but he needed his teeth cleaned and had a heart murmur but they could do that there. Ok. Give me an estimate of $300-600. Ok no biggie. Covid hits and all hell breaks loose there. Now his mouth is covered in bloody drool. Call them to schedule an appointment. The ""estimate"" was more then 6weeks old. I told them it's fine. It's only been 8weeks. Put me on hold and say they will do but it will be 4 months until we can do the dental cleaning. What? You can call back and see if we had any cancellations. Called back a few weeks later had the same rude lady answer the phone. Didn't look at anything and just said we didn't have any surgery cancellations. Click. Hung up the phone on me. Ok. Karen. Guess I'm not getting in any earlier. 3 days before his scheduled procedure I get a call that they had to cancel the appointment and the earliest they could do was another 3 months and I was ""lucky"" they were squeezing me in and they had NO vets currently working in the office. What?! Huh! Same Person who had hung the phone up on before by the voice. So it's a veterinary hospital with no vets currently working at it. Finally take him in for the appointment almost a year later. Looking at an estimate saying anywhere from $600-$1000. What?! Well after I tortured the cat, not giving him food or water since last night, too late now. He's also my baby I was more then willing to do that for him. Then I get a phone call asking if I want to cancel the appointment after I dropped him off.  because he has a ""growth"" in his mouth and find a vet who has a specialized x-ray machine for dental work in cats but good news he doesn't have a heart murmur that 3 other vets have told me about. Wait you don't have an X-ray machine there? Well not one to see all the fine detail. No I don't wanna cancel. Do the procedure. Cuz it would take another 5 months to get in somewhere. Ok. But we are really backed up today. Ok. Not my problem. Finally do the dental cleaning. 4 extractions and $1000 later. With a $178 biopsy to tell me his gums were inflamed and he didn't have cancer. Take him home. Give him his medicine. Which they didn't give me enough of according to the directions. Glad I'm a nurse and able to do math since someone there isn't able to. 3 days later he's vomiting. He gets upset when he pukes. Go running back there to grab more medicine. Thankfully I checked before I left almost gave me one that was meant for a 50 pound dog. Sure that would have killed him since he's a 12 pound cat. Get me the right dose that will be $56 for 4 pills. Almost charged me $78 for the remaining antibiotic that wasn't in the bag since the vet put a note on saying he doesn't need it and it just finish the bottle I have. Nice. Looked on Chewy this morning. Same medicine is $17. Nice one guys. His stomach is upset and you literally charged me 4x as much as the medicine cost because I don't have much of a choice at that point. Never again will we be returning here.

David is very nice and well meaning, unfortunately he billed us 3 times the amount of hours he ""expected"" he needed for an existing garage.  And this was not to actually get the process started.  He told us there are 2 options we could go.  Option 1 is a preprocess called planner consultation: of asking the city questions to find out the scope of the project.  This option would allow for us save money by seeing what we can do.  Isn't that what his services are for?  To do the research himself?  I researched the California coastal commission meetings and had to give David information that he thanked me for finding... Option 2 was to just submit to the city and see what happens.  He said option 2 could be a lot of investment without knowing the true answer.

Ok, so we chose option 1, as we are not the professionals.  3 months later plus almost $10,000, we get an answer from the city.  It's one line and it says, in summary, yes you can do a conversion based on the California coastal commission rulings, duh.  Case closed.  This is exactly the same information I sent David months previously.   

We ended up using Vanguard services, Jarred and Michael were much more proficient.  They gave us a reasonable fee schedule and stuck to their timing.  They were shocked by what we went through with David.

Soooooo here we go again, 2021 and I am in need of a TOW and I have to call on my roadside assistance service to get this towing party started.

Ring-a-ling... I'm calling!!!

To my great pleasure, the call was dispatched to AFFORDABLE TOWING. 

I received ONE update from the roadside assistance company about the towing service that was dispatched and the rest of the communication was regarding the time the towing company would arrive.

The ETA was 119 minutes, I can appreciate that and TRAVIS was johnny on the spot in that timeframe. He was polite, yes ma'am, no ma'am, gotta love that SOUTHERN CHARM. He advised me of what was going to happen and he proceeded to make it do-what-it-do!!!

My vehicle was loaded onto the bed & off he went with my baby to the repair shop of my choosing. ANNNNNNDDDDDD a bonus was that, 15-20 mins later, he called to say the vehicle was delivered, the eagle had landed!!!! WooooHoooo NEVER HAVE I HAD A TOWING COMPANY to advise of the delivery; I was ecstatic at this extra effort I was afforded. This took so much worry off my mind.

Because it was a job associated with my roadside assistance company, I didn't have to worry about fees, this was a plus.

From now on, I will utilize this service, although calling them will mean something is awry with my vehicle, at I least know my vehicle is in the best of care, my time will be appreciated & customer service is paramount.

He told me she told him what happened and she got busy!!! He never apologized nor did he try to accommodate me or reprimand his employee!!! They treated me as if I was wrong.  Not to mention my order was wrong.  Therefore I did not leave out of there until 1:57 because my order came out wrong. My call began at 1:00. I got my receipt after ordering in person at 1:17 and I had to wait all the way until 1:57.  I believe this was deliberately done to me as a punishment.  The whole entire waitstaff were making condescending remarks about me getting upset. I am very disappointed and I believe this happened because I am black.  Don't patronize this business!!!! They don't care about their customers!!!!!",2021-01-04 20:20:14,371,1746,

This place was recommended by several friends and since my go to place was booked till 10  I'd figured we would give it a try. I regret it. I had visiting family that we wanted to take to an AYCE place and wanted to impress- it only pissed all of us off and spoiled the meal.

Reservation: I called in earlier in the day and set up a reservation. Upon arrival, the waiting area was packed and I couldn't tell where to check in. I had to find the hostess who was hidden behind a sign/the wall. She said that they are running late and I had to wait 20 minutes and we agreed since we were hungry and everywhere else was booked the rest of the night. We decided to wait outside and asked if they could call us when the table was available. I walked back in 25 minutes later of a status check and the hostess seemed to even forget me and I had to remind her of the reservation. We waited another 10 minutes till being seated. This should've been a sign it wasn't going to be a pleasant dining experience.

Service- Once seated we immediately started looking at the menu and figured out what we wanted. We waited another 20 minutes, trying to waive down a waiter before ours approached us. We ordered our drinks, filled our our card and waited. Hangry doesn't even cut it. We ended up eating the ginger, only a small portion to share amongst 4 people that was provided, before even our drinks came. We waited another 30-35 minutes before our food came, missing some items we requested. Concerned with time, we asked the waiter how long till closing and she said they closed at 10pm but last call was at 930pm which was in about 15 minutes. She said she would be back to give us a heads up, she didn't. Luckily we were timing it. A hostess walked by, seeing us fill out the card and asked us if we needed anything. We told her we were getting out last call items in and she said she would get our waitress. Our waitress walked over and then reminded us, at 935 pm, that we have to get our order in. We placed our order and she told us that if we wanted desserts they had to be placed at that point as well which we did. 

She walked away and not 2 minutes later came back and said they will charge for any excess food remaining. That's understandable but  the comment was not well received since we were only served a couple orders of Nigiri and 3 rolls for 4 people. We told her we understood and almost immediately our food came out- where was this processing speed before?! 

We ended up eating all but maybe 4 pieces of a sushi since it was a pretty bad roll. We also ordered mochi ice cream and the vanilla had a weird flavor to it. 

Overall- I don't think we would ever recommend this place. Poor service and speed. I would think for a placed reduced in seating and requiring reservations would be better managed. Im pretty sure we wouldnt have gotten seated unless we bought it up. We felt rushed to eat our food and place our order but the speed of service and food is left to be desired. The food was decent, thus the 2 stars, but most of the rolls we ordered tasted the same, we were missing items from our order, and one roll specifically was very dry and bland.",2021-01-02 19:27:36,704,3346,

I have been to this wonderful establishment, more times than I can count, and I've never been disappointed. It's such a crowd pleaser, which is why it's my go-to when suggesting a place to eat. 

In the summer I went here a lot because they have tons of really great outdoor seating. They have really cute lights in their beer garden and two different covered patios (one is 21+ only). 

They always have a good beer and cider collection. So it's a a great place to grab a chill drink and an appetizer. They also have some really great cocktails, and some amazing seasonal food items. Basically you can't go wrong ordering something off their menu. While all of their items are great, the stars of the show are of course the smoked meats. They have brisket, chicken, and pulled pork among other things. Most of the time I order their brisket with sides of Brussels and mac & cheese. Never have I once regretted it.

Lately, I've been doing Whole30 and I was really worried that I would have to wait 30 long days before I could get the best brisket in town. However, I was shocked and amazed to find out that their brisket is Whole30 compliant!! It seriously tastes so good it feels like it's illegal. I'm still shocked. 

For the winter, they've closed-in their covered patios to add more seating. They also have some fire pits outside if you wanted to grab a beer and hang outdoors on days when the weather is warmer. They always have a wood fire going, which adds to the cozy atmosphere of the restaurant. And if amazing food, great drinks, and great vibes wasn't enough to boast about....the servers are so nice. I have really never had a bad experience with any of their staff. Always so helpful and accommodating. They even answer my super annoying Whole30 ingredient questions, which I seriously appreciate. 

Run. Don't Walk. Get the brisket. Get the burnt ends.",2021-01-18 19:19:52,405,1942,

Over the past few years, the Bristol has had occasional break-ins in the parking garage, which is not uncommon in Midtown. My car was even broken into once, but nothing was stolen. I don't blame these extremely rare occurrences on the Bristol, that's just the nature of living in a city. 

Recently, these break-ins have been happening at an alarming rate. In the past year (starting in approx. March 2020), it seems that I have gotten monthly reports from management of people breaking into the complex. These break-ins have resulted in busted car windows, intruders roaming the halls, and what sounded like grand theft auto. In reference to this final incident, management did not expressly disclose that this particular intrusion included grand theft auto, but that is what their notification email implied. They said something along the lines of a car was taken, but I do not 100% recall their exact language. 

Having said all of that, management has, to my knowledge, reported each incident to the residents via email. Whenever the parking garage door has been broken, management has hired a security guard to monitor that door. When management noticed that the intruders were breaking in, they built a fence and installed barbed wire to attempt to prevent entry. The building has installed security cameras. 

Unfortunately, none of these measures has curbed intruders. I feel exposed, and the prospect of leaving my apartment after 10:00pm genuinely frightens me. I worry that I'll run into someone who has broken in, and I get nervous every time I hear a knock on my door when I'm not anticipating a delivery. 

I'm not sure what the Bristol could do to remedy the issues it is currently facing. Management appears to be making an effort. All that being said, I would not chose to live here again. I hope they find a way to eliminate intrusions, but until that happens I would discourage prospective tenants from living here. I will update this review if the situation improves before I move out because aside from these break-ins, the Bristol is a nice place to live.",2021-01-20 23:48:53,438,2248,

Always kind, always friendly and always a great experience.  It has been a new reality for us that a restaurant can maintain and even increase the quality of their food and service.  But at Phaya, it is all true.  We have been visiting Phaya since it opened years ago and even through this pandemic, when other restaurants trade in their delicious food for poor quality ingredients, Phaya has tested true.  Their food is delicious and of high quality.  Every meal, every single time we go it is on par.  If you are new and want to try Thai food, authentic, delicious Thai food, then  here are some suggestions:

Pad See Ewe ( Mild or with no heat) - You can choose tofu or veggies or a variety of meats.  It is flavorful and not at all spicy.  Just delicious, drool-inducing food that is AMAZING

Tom Yum Soup - Choose your spice.  It starts with zero spice and that is how I order because Im a wimp.  You can order the soup the same way with tofu and or veggies or  their offered selection of meats.  Delicious on a cold day

Salad Rolls with that Thai Peanut sauce. - Simply the most glorious, refreshing thing you could eat.  Pair this with the Tom Yum Soup and you have a nice large and filling meal.

If you like Spicy food then the curry is always at least mild.  YOu can get it as hot as Thai hot but you really have to love heat for that one otherwise it might be too much even for the most spicy-conscious. 

Being 100% honest when I say that there is NOTHING bad here.  Try it.  Go out on a limb and take a small step outside of your comfort zone.  Ask for No spice and experience the amazing food they offer here.

My low review is based in two factors. 1. They only accept check or cash. In a world of covid pet alone where you can open a kids candy store and accept cards, that's si.pmy unreasonable. They will send you out to hit an ATM and come back.while I understand they limit your ability to enter for pick up to one at a time, the idea of running to get cash and going back to a line was very inconvenient. 

 2. And this one is huge for me. I Ordered over the phone for a bolognese sauce which was on the menu. They accepted my order. I came in and the owner said yeah meat sauce. I repeated bolognese. Hey very sternly told me that is meat sauce. He advised me to tell the young people who seemed confused meat sauce because that's how they know it. But it was bolognese. Considering his wife owns Basils fine Italian dining, this was very sad. 

When I arrived it was a meat sauce, a ragu. I personally make bolognese, I often order bolognese, and I know enough to to know the difference. I consider those tactics underhanded, misguided and a demonstration of either the owner's willingness to deceive or lack of understand of common Italian foods. 

He lost me as a customer. I was bring the food to show off to friends who would be future patrons who are not impressed. And considering I got pizza over the years from them I am very disappointed to have to share this. I personally support local shops and restaurants.

We are extremely displeased with Cenlar. My boyfriend's name is on our mortgage and we had one payments that wasn't accepted from Cenlar from his bank. Since then Cenlar has made us send in our payments in the mail. They never told us this and we tried for months to make a payment through the app and online and it never worked. When Cenlar would call us there would be a message that would play and right before it connected us to a person it would hang up. My boyfriend has called them multiple times every month and no one ever calls him back. We recently were able to finally get a hold of someone on Thursday and my boyfriend asked to speak to a supervisor where he was told he can't at that moment someone would get back to him in 24 hours. We are now 48 hours past that and haven't heard from anyone and we will probably never hear from them. We haven't even been getting our bills in the mail anymore. How are we expected to pay every month if we don't get the bill in the mail? We are so tired of this company and would never recommend them to anyone. I have never heard of a company making it so hard for anyone to pay them. At this point we will most likely looking to get a new mortgage company because we are so fed up.

I also liked that they weren't being over done on safety protocols but they were reminding customers of the rules when they weren't following them like walking through the restaurant without a mask or please wear it upon entering.  Plus they did a great job of social distancing the tables as well. So for applause for following what we should be doing...

The sandwich and soup was outstanding and yet not a lot of ingredients....I had the Do Gouda sandwich and consisted of roast beef, gouda, onion marmalade on sourdough bread with some fresh greens. Also accompanied was a cup of their tomato soup.  First bite of the sandwich I was like Oh Yeah! The crispness of the sourdough and then the blend of cheese, meat and onion marmalade was in every bite. Then onto the soup and well balanced here with very forward tomato which in my opinion is the best because some folks think they need to reinvent this classic and they don't.  So after a few bits of my sandwich and sips of soup something dawned on me and that was just because this wasn't grilled cheese (which they have by the way) this sandwich would taste amazing dipped in this soup. Well here I went and wow a whole new flavor profile immersed. So while I wasn't planning on dipping this sandwich into my soup that's exactly how I finished.

Up until he brought us our drinks.. after that we didn't see our server until he brought our food.. 

the food was horrible. I got a burger it had no dressing. I asked for thousand island which took him forever to come back and let me know ""I'm sorry but we're all out of thousand island"" and instead gave me a chipotle sauce. I also got their Brussel sprouts and they were sour and had no crunch. They were still very hard. My wife got a beef dip and the sandwich was cold the beef was dry. We even asked for extra napkins for the table 2 times when ever we would be able to get ahold of him.. (Mind you there was 4 of us) the server would only bring 2 napkins.. and we would never see him again. He didn't even come to the table not once to refill our drinks. 

Now it's time to pay.. we split the bill.. just for me and my wife it came out to $52.31 when I noticed how much it was I couldn't believe my eyes because the quality of their food does not match their prices.. I'm usually a can you take this off my bill kind of person but I bit the bullet and paid for it I  specifically remember not leaving a tip because of this horrible experience i discussed with my cousin why I  wasn't leaving one and she didn't either and so we went on with our day..

I told him you have my name this was 2 days ago you can't go back in your receipts and check!? I  also specifically explained to him why I did not leave a tip because of the shitty service & how i write a zero with a long line through it when I  don't leave a tip.. so finally He gave me his email address and told me to send him a picture of my credit card statement and a picture of my receipt that I at first couldn't find but ended up finding.. till this day still no response I got no call back not even a response to the email.

The new house is freshly designed, open, beautiful and appearance is highly attractive. It is however, small like a satellite restaurant if you will.

Staff is friendly and gave us a free sample after questioning the flavor or their in house potato salad. Never being to one of these 'micro' versions of the larger style restaurants, I noticed the reviews for this restaurant were'nt stellar so it got me pondering, why? 

This new location is in a wonderful area geographically for Tucson restaurants and it's upscale in design. I came here in January 2021 with a party of 7. The pricing was a bit high on behalf of the entire crew that was with me in relation to the portion size(s), maybe, they'll adjust that in the future??

Overall, the restaurant was visually highly appealing, smelled delicious and the meal was crazy fast to our tables. I ordered the burnt end/tips but really would wished the portion sizes were a smidgen more. Though the brisket was certainly delectable, I can't say the in house made potato salad was a win - for me, but hey, to each their own. The restaurants accouterments table was unused due to C-29 restrictions, so the appearance of barely used is still present which is a shame because the restaurant is beautifully designed. Though, no spatial plastic dividers amongst the tables like you see at other restaurants. To me, they're silly in the first place as they'll certainly NOT stop viruses and the point behind them is mute to me in the first place so glad to see they didn't waste finances on installing those.

This was a huge purchase for a young person, and he was perfect every step of the way. The low rating I'm giving this location, however, is based on our experience with the finance department.

Having bought many cars in my life, I knew there was going be a long list of warranties that they would encourage her to purchase. I explained this to my daughter ahead of time, and explained why she should decline all of them. Obviously, that's from personal experience. As i said, the finance guy  was super pleasant and professional  when we first met with him-- UNTIL we turned down every single warranty. He then turned into a huge (insert your word of choice here!) His voice turned from friendly to rude. He was extremely cold and short after that. He acted ""mad"" at us. He rushed through everything else & stopped being friendly. The WORST part --I counted (at least) FIVE times that he mentioned (specifically about declining gap insurance) ""just don't wreck the car on the way home"" or ""as long as you don't total the car"" ""gap insurance would have covered you if you total your car when you leave this lot. That actually happened last week!"" --some variation of that. I felt so bad for my daughter, as this was such a big moment in her life and now she was terrified to drive a brand new car home.

We were previous Discount Tire customers and switched to Big O because of damage Discount Tire had done to our rims multiple times. Discount always paid to fix the damage but it was a hassle. At Discount Tire, the warranty covers everything. If you opt not to buy the warranty on the replacement tire, your cost is $0 out the door. We incorrectly assumed it would be the same at Big O. That's not how the Big O warranty works. They charge you for everything again. Mounting, stem charge, tire disposal, balancing, etc. Oddly, they recommended an alignment again when they just did one less than two weeks ago on our truck. I don't get that either. In the end, we had to pay over $70 for something that is supposed to be covered by the warranty. We like the folks at Big O but their warranties are really a ripoff compared to Discount.

We invited good friends of ours to join us since they'd never been. Parking in the garage was easy and the entrance is off of Illinois Street. Parking wasn't outrageous at $10 for 4 hours. 
The weather turned out to be crisp and clear so the view was spectacular. We arrived a few minutes early so we had a short wait which went by quickly.

Our server, Wolfgang, arrived at our table about 5 minutes after we were seated. He was very pleasant and answered all of our questions. We placed our drink orders and Wolfgang did an excellent job of keeping our drinks refilled. When he asked for appetizers we explained we were undecided and required a few more minutes. Unfortunately, he asked for our dinner order at the same time. After a few minutes, we each decided on our appetizers and entrees. 

My husband had the Steakhouse Chili as his appetizer which he enjoyed with the Beef Tenderloin and Brisket. I had the Lobster Bisque which was very creamy and flavorful. Our friends had the Skyline Brussel Sprouts with Goat Cheese, Honey and Almonds and the Indiana Corn Brulee with Jalapeno Cream and Cheddar Cheese. They both raved about the Brussel Sprouts and the Corn Brule was enjoyed as well. We were all baffled why the soups were served in an extremely oversized bowl which didn't make for an attractive presentation if that was the idea (IOO). Unfortunately, we still had not received our napkins and silverware and had to ask for those before enjoying our appetizers. Two of us had decided on the Maple Bourbon Glazed Salmon but when we ordered Wolfgang apologized they had ran out much earlier and he forgot to mention. 

We had a long wait between courses and was starting to think we had been forgotten or our meals weren't turned into the kitchen. My friend went to find the Manager in hopes of determining why we hadn't seen Wolfgang or our entrees. The Manager came over to our table to explain the kitchen became swamped with folks arriving without reservations. While he was at our table he also cleared the appetizer dishes. He was so kind and apologetic plus offered to comp our desserts which we weren't looking for but we did order desserts.

Shortly after his visit to our table our meals arrived. Our friend ordered the Pan Roasted Chilean Sea Bass served over Basmati Rice, Root Vegetables, Coconut Curry and Kaffir Lime Yogurt. He topped it with the Jumbo Lump Crab in Bearnaise Ailoi. The Sea Bass was the hit of the evening. It was light and tender, no fishy after taste, the flavors were delightful and a beautiful presentation. I would return just to order the Sea Bass. His wife ordered the fresh and crisp Classic Ceasars Salad, the fabulous Crushed Potatoes with Guajillo Butter and rounded it off with the remaining Brussel Sprouts and Corn Brulee. All of us kept diving in for another crushed potato. They were spectacular, loved the seasonings. They were sharable sides but we should have ordered two bowls of these. They were that good. 

My husband ordered the Pan Seared Sea Scallops served with Sweet Corn Puree, Buttered Leek Risotto and Blackberry Reduction. The Scallops were beautifully prepared and exceptionally tender. We raved to him how delicious risotto was but his arrived mushy and had a bitter flavor. He didn't want to return since it had taken so long for our meals to arrive. I had the Classic Caesar Salad which was fresh and tasty plus a 4 oz side of Jumbo Crab with Bearnaise Ailio. The salad and crab was satisfying but I would have preferred less aioli on the crab. 

The menu also offers Kale and Beets, several different sides, a Chicken entree with Butternut Squash Hash and Asian Grilled Lamb Chops. A Filet Mignon, a bone-in Ribeye, a Porterhouse and a Wagyu Tomahawk for 2 is offered, too.

Our desserts were scrumptious! Three of us ordered the generous portion of Flourless Chocolate Cake. It was decadent and creamy with chocolate mouse and blueberries. My husband ordered a Bourbon for his dessert. 

It was wonderful spending the evening with good friends. I just wish we wouldn't had the huge gap in service since I was the only one who had been here before.

Their meatballs were very comforting and tasty. Nothing over the top nor too fancy, but traditional and thoroughly a taste of comfort. Their marinara, however, was the star of the dish. It tasted so fresh and it kind of just snuck in there (not trying to be a show-off) and stole the show. There wasn't a drop of marinara wasted. I would probably eat anything they have with this marinara on top. 

Hubby had the Pollo Portofino, which is a sautéed chicken breast with artichoke hearts and mushrooms in a creamy white wine Aurora sauce. He loved it.  

We ordered some Garlic Bread (which everyone inhaled), Mozzarella Caprese, and Polenta Porcini. 

Let me tell you... that Polenta Porcini is so crazy good! It is grilled polenta with porcini mushrooms and Gorgonzola. Oh my! I will most definitely get this every time! I was even looking at the menu again a bit ago and thought that I might even make a meal out of two appetizers: Polenta Porcini and the Calamari Fritti, especially if I can add a dipping sauce type cup of their Marinara (in addition to their Spicy Marinara Dipping Sauce).

I now know why my sis-in-love and her late Italian hubby enjoyed Mario's Portofino so much. It is obviously made with love, traditional, and tasty.

I did not get any pictures, because we were eating late and were starving. Sorry about that.  ;)",2021-01-26 00:34:33,391,1916,

The atmosphere is nice, although it is confusing after the Aquarium closes, and you must enter through the patio. The bar, tables, etc. are all very nice. 

We ordered the Stuffed Spuds, which are really just large tater tots, they were fine. A little cold and not the best. I also ordered the scallops which were good, but the green beans were not even warm and were not cooked at all (I'm used to fresh green beans, but you have to cook them, at least). The sauce was very salty and not great. 

Our main complaint was about the brussel sprouts - which are apparently fried in a deep fryer. They were burned to a char (photo included), and completely inedible. We are pretty sure that they had gotten cold, or were old, and then were re-fried. They were disgusting. We each took one small bite of the ash-like sprouts. When the server asked us how things were, we were honest and told her the sprouts were terrible and inedible, and she said, ""Oh, I'm sorry to hear that."" and then walked away from the table. She made no effort to take them back to have them remade, or remove them from our bill. 

My boyfriend got the Nashville Hot Chicken, he said it was dry, but it was a sandwich.

Overall, I think we spent about $80, and were still a little hungry when we left. I'd recommend the seafood place or the Fountain instead, just avoid this one.",2021-01-20 17:55:04,316,1433,

The COVID restrictions and such have regretfully permanently closed many small businesses... Luckily this business is still around... Chicago Pizza With A Twist on 2900 Clear Acre Ln, Reno, NV.... The restaurant itself is very clean, but not fancy or particular pleasing to the eye.. The food on the other hand is a work of art... India and Italian fusion. Who woulda thought... And it works very well... The pizza dough they use on their pizzas is very tasty (which is a big deal for most pizza lovers) and their sauces and ingredients are fresh and well put together. I have had their chicken wings and they are delightfully oven crisp, and meaty with a choice of crazy sauces, but the pizza's are what are truly impressive to me. It's straight up flavor town. I just love their Latino Style pizza which I ordered.. A combination of sweet and hot. I do not care for Hawaiian pizza's with ham and pineapple on them.. Well.. This pizza has pineapple on it and it is fantastic. Go Figure..  And you can get all the pizza's extra spicy..  I also ordered their new Spicy Tahir Achari Chicken pizza which has white garlic sauce .. This was outrageously good... I have had their pizza's with an India flair as well, like their pizza's with Tikka sauce, Tandoori sauce, Curry, Manchurian, and with lamb Kebab, etc.. They are all equally good. When I received my pizza's to go, I opened the boxes and saw that both pizza's were put together with care. In fact they were both really pretty.. I even liked the pizza box they came in...

""This was the best car wash place until the new owners took over! They don't care about quality of work or the customer whatsoever! The quality of the washes are extremely sub par compared to when the old owners ran things!

The old owners were so accommodating and never nickel and dimed you for ""extra"" services. But now, even to get your dash just wiped down is an ""extra"" charge and service! This will be my last time coming to this place!  All because of the new owners and how they're running the place into the ground. There used to be a line to the street of people getting their cars washed all day and cars waiting in line before they opened....not anymore. Now you can pull up and only wait behind 1 or 2 cars max! That says something to me!

I would have given it zero stars if I could! That's how disappointed I am that this staple of Clearwater that has been here for years is now this way under the new ownership and management.


Response from the owner...
Craig, we apologize for your bad experience at Sunshine Carwash. Our staff is always trained to never ""nickel and dime"", but to only recommend services. Light wipe down of the dash is included in all our services except for exterior only. If you'd like to express your concerns further give us a call. 7274172627.""


You couldn't even get my name right in their response!!!  And no, wiping of the dash is not included...I asked.  Your pricing is outrageous with diminishing quality!

In her 8 years of life she's never had table food. But I guess that meat was a shock to her body because the next day, she was so sick. She had diarrhea and vomited multiple times. I thought she pretty much had gotten it out of her system but unfortunately Day 2 she had gotten worse and scared me half to death. I immediately called the nearest Vet to me in a panic.  I had never been to Fall Creek Veterinary Medical before but they got her an appointment right away. 

Upon arrival she was weighed and we were put in our private room. They do require masks, social distancing and the Dr. will only see the pet but you stay in the private room while the Dr. examines your pet. Although my dog is typically super friendly, she turns into a little fighter at the vet. She gets anxiety and super stressed and won't allow them to touch her. They were able to take her in the back and get her muzzled to find out what was going on. The Dr. called my cell phone and gave me periodic updates with his recommendations and even advised of costs (no surprise billing). Thankfully she didn't have to be hospitalized or have extensive treatment and looks like she will recover just fine. 

The staff was super friendly and compassionate and made me feel at ease. The next day the Dr. himself called me to follow up and check on her. 

I had such a great experience, my little fur baby will be going there routinely for healthy visits :-)

She kept scolding me throughout the whole nail session and seemed to be in a hurry. I understand it's a business and she wants to service her other clients, but sitting down with her was very unpleasant. She kept telling me to get off my phone which i totally understand but I looking for a photo to show her for my nails. I then proceeded to listen to music in my airpods and she kept telling me to get off my phone. All I was doing was listening to music..... No one ever scolds me like that.

The servers response was ""I am the manager we are busy you are waisting your own time!"" Then walked away... 
Believe it or not wasn't the  worst part of the night!!

At this point we showed our stamps to guy at the door went outside to discuss whether we were going to stay decided the girls are having an OK time we'll just stay and eat after.

I responded ""he has to Pee is all as far as I know!""
Door guy"" he needs to show me his stamp and do u have a problem "" standing in my face now!
My response was ""I have an issue with poor service! Also if u approached my friend as  aggressively as u just approached me seems to me u are the one starting an issue! I would like to speak to a manager""!

Older guy (""owner?"") overheard said he would talk to door guy then said he would walk us out to protect us from door guy!!
Me ""I got news for ya u are understaffed over packed and u have an employee threatening people if he touches anyone in my group we will file charges!""

Older guy (owner?) Instantly changed his attitude and at this point have it escalate so far starts apologizing for the inconvenience and his door guy repeatedly to my party! ( it would have meant something had he done his job and handled his employees before he heard YELP!!)

I am truly surprised Marriott allows this property to be part of the Courtyard brand. The room quality was worse than even any motel I've stayed at. The room they first gave me was extremely dirty, during COVID times! Dirty towels hanging in closet, underwear sticker on wall, stains all over wall and floor, greasy fingerprints on phone, cockroach in light fixture... clearly wasn't cleaned other than a made bed. I went to the front desk to complain, had to wait behind another party complaining about the exact same situation. I was moved to a new room. The new room was better, but not great. There were some sort of bug feces behind the toilet, disconnected doorknob, and stains on the carpet. I realized at this point that my room wasn't a one-off, it is the hotel. The rooms are dirty, extremely dirty, and dimly lit. I would never come back unless renovated.

Now the front desk was polite when I raised the issue. Like I mentioned, they moved me to a different room and comped me one night. However, later that night they woke me girlfriend and I by calling me at midnight to again apologize. What hotel doesn't have the common decent sense to not call a guest at midnight?? This ruined the entire evening of sleep. Between that midnight call and the clear lack of any cleaning, I have given the service a poor rating.

I really wanted to check out one of their igloos that they have set up on their patio area as it looked like a fun new experience. We tried to go a few weeks ago and found out that the igloos are quite popular and people are making reservations about 4 days out. I learned from that experience and made a reservation for this past Sunday. A friend and I dined in the igloo where you have a reservation for 1 hour and 15 min. The igloo can seat like 6 or so but I would recommend 2-4 people as an hour and 15 goes by super fast! Our waitress was super friendly and helpful! We ordered a few tacos each and chips and salsa. In the past, I've really enjoyed the West County Housewife taco and also the popcorn shrimp this time was bomb! Everything was tasty and delicious! They do a great job limiting contact by placing your items on a small table right inside the igloo. In-between reservations they clean and air out the igloos. While they make an effort to heat the igloo, it's pretty chilly and I'd recommend a coat, hat and even a blanket if you get cold easily. There's a tiny space heater inside the igloo and heat lamps outside. It's something fun to do during quarantine and I can't wait for my next dining experience!

I drive by Fazoli's on the regular and have seen them promoting new chicken wings the marque. Being a chicken wing lover, I was tempted to give them a try, but was hesitant to do so. I just couldn't wrap my head around a fast food restaurant serving up good wings. Lucky for me, a cousin gave them a try and told me they were not bad. 

Hearing a thumbs up from a family member, I was ready to give them a try. So last night on my way home from work, I drove thru their drive-thru and ordered the Boneless Garlic Parmesan (10 pieces). When I ordered, they offered me Ranch or Blu Cheese for dipping. I'm not a wing dipper, so I declined, but I want you know it is available. 

My cousin was right, they were fairly good for the price and coming from a fast food pasta restaurant. The pieces were a variety of sizes and even with the difference in size, they were perfectly prepared. I was expecting a more dry garlic parmesan, but this one was more of a heavy sauce. I want to go back and try the buffalo sauce. 

I'm also thinking about cheating and buying the Garlic Parmesan again and bringing it home to dice up and add to a homemade Alfredo sauce. It make a nice and simple pasta dish, really fast. 

The young lady who was working the drive-thru was super sweet. I would vote for her as Miss Congeniality.  She was super perky over the intercom and even more so at the window.

However, there is a real problem with service. Specifically with what it seems to be one of your managers. I'm going to have to describe this person because she was not wearing a name tag and I don't want to call out the wrong person. This particular person was Asian decent (respectfully). Nevertheless this person has a really sour attitude and doesn't listen to anything someone has to say. She rushes you through the food order and speaks very fast and in my opinion rudely.

Maybe you owners hired this person because of manager experience but I think you should keep her in the back doing manager things because she is not a people person. In fact I even noticed that the other employees look stressed when she's around. When this particular person is not there my experience is very delightful. The employees are always smiling and will help you through your order without rushing you out the door. Make no mistake this isn't recent and it isn't because of covid. I have been eating there for over a year and every time this particular person helps me she almost makes you feel like it's a problem taking your order. Her answers are always very short and rude.

So hopefully the owners will read this and take into consideration that maybe they should consider a new manager or keep the existing manager in the back kitchen so she is not allowed to help customers. Eventually people are going to be irritated and not eat there as there are many other poke places to go to.

In fact next time I go there and I see her serving people I'm simply going to leave and go somewhere else.",2021-01-07 18:39:53,335,1692,

Most places just use a cheese sauce out of a can and rely on the food for flavor. Nice Guy's does it right, I'd come back just for that nacho cheese sauce. Overall it was a fantastic experience. The place has a cool hip vibe, the music they played was great, we got there during a shift change so we had two servers. Both servers were attentive, friendly and knowledgeable of the menu giving great recommendations. The place was very clean and the bathrooms were impeccable. Nice Guys will be added to our list of favorite place to eat from here on out.",2021-01-01 22:13:17,365,1686,

When I call them, someone who hates their job and has answered the phone with no intention on being helpful or empathetic to the fact that I have now missed work to accommodate delivery of an item I'm now told is not even in stock.
Fast forward to today. I get a call at 4:04pm by the delivery driver saying that he's at my house. 
I tel him I'm at work and was operating under the information that was provided to me verbally and confirmed in the subsequent email that was sent out, advising I would be provided with a 30 minutes window.
I explain I require that window to get from my job to my home to receive said delivery. 
The driver says, ""well they always say that but they don't do it. I'll wait for you."" 
As I'm driving home I get a call from dispatch telling me the driver is going to finish his next TWO deliveries and come back to my house when he's done.
I explain that I'm only 15 minutes from home now, and she tells me he's already left.
I request an ETA for when he will be back and after holding for 10 minutes and making it back home, I am told that he'll be returning in about 25 minutes. 
25 minutes comes and goes, I call them back, wait on hold for 25 minutes, and am told, ""the driver noted that he went back, no one was home, and he's already returned to the warehouse and is gone for the day.""
Both Sam Levitz and Ashley Homestore are the most unprofessional scoundrels I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with. 
Alex who claimed to be a supervisor in the Delivery Department was condescending and rude, and I wonder how there are no checks and balances in place to ensure that customers are being treated fairly and that people who are hired to do a job are actually doing said job. 
I'm currently waiting for a supervisor to call me back to issue me a refund.

Been to all of the theaters with luxury seats, Galaxy tops them all. Didn't get a back ache from these. Cinemark has some great seats, too. As does Harkins and AMC. But these are great. Just as good if not better than Roadhouse.

There are lots of screens here, all have exceptional sound systems. If you are lucky and get in the big room, there are 52 speakers there waiting for you with incredible sound.

They have like 32"" touch screens for ticket kiosks. Very nice. You can use their app to purchase tickets and reserve your seats ahead of time.

Their concessions are yummy! The popcorn is the best of any theater as they use REAL butter and distribute it on the corn nicely. They have the best containers, too, with domed lids with a hole to put your hand through. (Think large Icee drink lid.)

This is nearly a 30 minute drive for us, but it is so worth it to view a good movie.

5* = A top favorite. Mind-blowing good. I will definitely return and I will go out of my way to go here. Worth every dime of my money.

4* = Outstanding. Tucson-top-tier. Some elements not quite as good as it gets, but it still is worthy of my regular business.

3* = Good experience. I might do repeat business if it is convenient, the only option, the only one in its category, or on a whim, but would not be among the first thing to come to mind. Would definitely recommend you trying it to get your own take on it.

2* = Not so good. Would not recommend at all. Waste of money.

I understand that these aren't American tacos slathered in cheese and sauce, but because of that, I would expect the proteins to be stellar enough to not really need much else.
I can only speak for the tacos, chips & guac - we didn't try any of the other menu items because it was our first time. Between us we tried: fish, brisket, carne asada & lengua tacos with a side of chips & guac. The chips are super weird, it seems like they're made out of flour tortillas, and ever single one I had was super stale. The guac.... ugh. Just don't even try. Where's the salt? Where's the like? Where's any flavor at all? All of the tacos were huuuuuge let downs. chewy, bland carne asada. fish that's mostly batter. overwhelming amount of thick sliced (not diced) onion. very small amount of meat for tortilla size. dry tortillas that fall apart bc they aren't doubled up. we didn't wait very long after ordering, maybe 10 minutes tops, but somehow everything was still cold? It's weird that they seem to really emphasize social distancing buuuutttttt there's an entire sauce bar with spoons in each condiment that you have to touch to serve yourself, meaning you're not the only one to stick your hand near all those sauces in the middle of a pandemic.  and yet somehow still, even the salsas were bland. 
I wanna give them the benefit of the doubt, so I wouldn't be mad if I was dragged here again by someone else, but I certainly won't be back on my own accord.",2021-01-07 01:23:18,355,1603,

I ordered the carne asada tacos with rice for 19$ and 2 tres leches cake for 10$ ea. Lemme tell you it's not worth it, I regretted 100% of this. It shouldn't cost me 42$ for this amount of food and the food itself was so dry. Never have I ever felt like killing myself after trying this place.

The carne asada tacos had nothing but a few onion bits and meat, where the fuck is my guacamole, tomato's, salsa etc... this shit made me want to throw food at their store. The meat had no flavor and all I tasted was onion. Legit awful choice. I'm guessing it's corn tortillas... and it was thicker than the girth of my  why the fuck is it so dry? I'd rather buy 19$ worth dogecoin at .10cents, it was that bad.

The rice that came with my entree was so awful that it gave me acid reflux and the combination of the two just don't match, had 1 scoop and thew the rest out. I can't take it anymore.

Man I hoped that the tres leches could've made me want to change my mind, but it didn't, why tf is the cake also so fucking dry? Why is it so small too?, is it to compensate for non wasteful food when I decide not to eat it? Took 1 bite and extremely disappointed. There's nothing tres about this, it's just spongy with no milk oozing out, so flavorless it tasted like regular pound cake. 

Overall, if you're either drunk or got a ton of money this is the place for you. Cuz you're either not caring what the food taste like while drunk or you try new things and not worry about the cost, because the entree and dessert will cost you 30$ per person. Probably more if you order drinks and appetizers. There are better places to eat at a much cheaper price on the other side of the bridge like karlas or greenhouse, don't go to frans pub because I once found a piece of hair stuck inside my food and all they did was say sorry, and it was the cooks fault why is the waitress saying that to me?

I'm just copying and pasting what I put on there and I will attach photos of the gift card redemption stuff because the link is real and it does work. For whoever was saying they didn't know the actual price of their system is baffling too. You literally have to sign for it and when in doubt, ASK QUESTIONS. I asked a plethora of questions and our poor guy was at our house until MIDNIGHT. A whole three hours because I was not going to invest into a system without knowing absolutely everything. They go to houses all day long, every single day. It's possible that they think they told you the price but didn't. Just ask and they will answer. Anyway: 


I frequently go to Home Depot and I just bought a house that was built in 1897, meaning there's a lot of work to do. When I was there, a woman came up to me and asked me to participate in a survey about the quality of water in my city. It's extremely poor so of course I participated. I also was entered into a giveaway. A few weeks go by and I get a phone call saying that the drawing hasn't happened yet but they're offering free water tests and a gift card to Home Depot. I honestly only accepted the test for the gift card because I'm trying to ball on a budget. then when I saw how disgusting my water is, I had to get the reverse osmosis system installed. I was a little weary about it as I've just purchased brand new windows but this company is amazing and they work with your specific needs. What got my attention is the benefits. Lifetime warranty on my system and I'm freely given starter points that I can use to purchase items from them such as plant based products or more salt for my system. I mention this because I was about 2 weeks away from spending $70-$80 on a concentration kit from a plant based company. It would probably last me about 4 months or so. With my system install tonight, I was given the same thing but MORE. Now only time will tell on the quality of products however I have really high expectations and will update my review accordingly as time goes on. Prior to install, we had a leak in our basement that was running our water bill up quite high and the techs that came out killed two birds with one stone. Fixed our leak and put our system exactly where we wanted it. When I called a plumber to quote me on the leak, he said it would take 2 hours and be around $300 so for this company to take care of it for us was really sweet. They were not obligated to do it but they did it anyway. This house has a lot of work that needs to be done and I am absolutely certain that we will be back for a tankless water heater and plumbing for our bathrooms.",2021-01-30 02:58:01,581,2722,

It was definitely one of the more memorable dining experiences during our trip. The restaurant was divided into different dining rooms. I forgot what room I dined in but each table had two-three different colored balloons on them. It was that they had strolling three-piece jazz band that played various tunes including ""Blue Skies"", ""You're My Sunshine"", ""Over the Rainbow"", ""What a Wonderful World"", and ""Jambalaya"".

After placing our drink and food orders, our server brought us garlic bread, which consisted of an open faced baguette topped with olive oil, garlic, herbs, and grated parmesan cheese. For drinks, I recommend the Poinsettia (if you like something fruity) and Whiskey Smash (if you like something strong).

During brunch, they offered a pre-fixe menu that included a starter, entree, and dessert. For soups, you could select from Turtle Soup, Gumbo, and Potato and Bacon.

For starters, I'd recommend the Turtle Soup, Commander's Creole Gumbo,  Winter Strawberry & Citrus Salad, and Whiskey Roasted Apple & Winter Squash Parfait. The Turtle Soup consisted of a rich stock cooked with turtle meat, green bell pepper, onion, collard green, lemon, and aged sherry. Turtle tasted like minced beef or pork. I liked how it was tangy and had a hint of spice. The Commander's Creole Gumbo consisted of a rich stock cooked with seafood, toasted garlic, and creole seasoning. The Winter Strawberry & Citrus Salad consisted of spicy mixed greens, local strawberries, red grapefruit, navel oranges, kumquat, pecans, and lemon pound cake croutons tossed in a kaffir-lime limoncello vinaigrette. The Whiskey Roasted Apple & Winter Squash Parfait consisted of roasted zucchini bread topped with brown butter, honey whipped creole cream cheese, whiskey roasted apple and winter squash, and raisins in mulled red wine syrup and salted pear cider caramel sauce.

For entrees, I'd recommend the Pecan Roasted Gulf Fish, New Orleans Barbecued Shrimp (with Creole Potatoes instead of Grits), Farmer's Market Vegetable Frittata, and Cochon De Lait Eggs Benedict. The Pecan Roasted Gulf Fish consisted of a wild caught sheepshead topped with local greens, melted leeks, spiced pecans, and prosecco poached jumbo lump crabmeat in a Woodford Reserve Bourbon corn sauce. It was delicious.

For desserts, I'd recommend the Creole Bread Pudding Souffle, Strawberry Shortcake, and Strawberry Margarita Sorbet. Despite the long wait (about half an hour), the desserts were worth the wait. The Creole Bread Pudding Souffle was served with warm whiskey sauce. The Strawberry Shortcake consisted of a bed of local strawberries topped with a fluffy buttermilk biscuit with powdered sugar and chantilly cream. The Strawberry Margarita Sorbet was served in a 400-degree caramelized sugar bowl and garnished with a strawberry and lime. We enjoyed dessert with coffee and tea. For teas, they offered the following Stash Teas - Chamomile, Meyer Lemon, Pomegranate Hibiscus, Green Tea, Chai Spice, Orange Spice, English Breakfast, and Earl Grey. Among the teas, I selected the Earl Grey with cream and sugar.",2021-01-07 03:53:33,612,3213,

Took a solid five minutes for someone to show up at the host stand to seat us.

Drinks took 20+ minutes to come out, allegedly because the bartender printer broke. Apologies? Not really.

Deviled eggs were pretty good.

The bloody Mary was literally the worst cocktail I think I've ever had. It tasted like cocktail sauce without the thickness. I don't know how it's possible to mess up a bloody, but they did it. Disgusting! no heat, barely any vodka, no flavor other than gross tomato juice. Couldn't finish it. The bartender should be drawn and quartered for this abomination. I told the server it was gross and she basically shrugged, walked away, and seemed like she didn't want to check in on us after that.

Mimosa flight was meh.

Our main courses were a bit delayed because the runner didn't know which table to go to, so we saw him with our food running around the restaurant like a grade A moron.

Chicken and waffles was ok but waffle was room temp and the eggs were over hard instead of easy. Would've told the server this, but again, she went AWOL!

Short rib hash was flavored with a pound of salt and not much else. Super greasy and couldn't get through it.

Would I go back? Absolutely not. It seemed like every other table in the place had issues going on too.

My lamp was not an antique nor a special lamp and it was manufactured within the last 8 years. I used it for my workspace while working from home. One of the light domes came loose and was hanging. They originally told me that the repair would cost approximately $20, then this later jumped to $80 in a follow up call. I was told there was a part that is not manufactured anymore and that this increased the cost. (Since that time I have shown pictures of this lamp to another repairman and was told there should be nothing about this lamp that would be so unique.) Anyway, when I went to pick up my lamp the first time after waiting 2.5 MONTHS to receive it back (late Dec 2020), the base was caked in dust. This was the first thing that made me wonder about their business practices. Yuck, I thought... I did not drop it off that way. Lexi must not be much of an improvement on the former sales lady...When she picked my dusty lamp up to get it from a side area one of the domes swung around and hit their high, bullnose wooden counter. Lexi did not mention this nor apologize. It was almost comical, as if this happens regularly? She also did not offer to help me to the car with the lamp. These types of lamps ought to be to wrapped with a plastic wrap at center so nothing swings around. They ought to offer help out, and certainly make sure lamps are presentable for pick up. So I placed the lamp in my car and headed to the grocery store. An hour later I am unloading my lamp to bring it into my home. It breaks in half at center! I am wondering how it was treated in this shop (when I wasn't looking). I brought the broken lamp back to this shop and was told I'd be called. I never was; I had to call them and I was told I'd be charged to fix it yet again. I finally called them the last week of the year to ask when it would be ready. I was told by the end of that week. When I said to Lexi that I truly doubted this time estimate, she snarkily said, ""Merry Christmas"" and hung up. I wish I had paid with a credit card and not cash. I would certainly be contesting these charges. I also wish I had read all these reviews. At this point I don't even want my lamp back because I don't want to step foot in there again. Plus, it's been so long I had to replace it anyway. They still have my lamp and they still haven't called (it's now Jan 10th, 2020), nor do they respond to email I guess. In summary, the only good thing about this place in my opinion is the location. However, if I ever need to repair a lamp again, I'd drive far and wide to do so.",2021-01-10 06:10:34,595,2624,

Restroom is very spacious and very clean. This house is for people who prefer to keep the house clean. There are trash chutes just next to your door or stairs. 

The reason I am taking off all stars are:

1. Ants everywhere. Cannot drink water. All my water glass, drink-ware where I have a sip gets invaded by these devil ants. This is a worst place to live in.

2. Kitchen is very small. Only two countertops. A huge restroom and a tiny kitchen??!! Who engineered that?! You cannot even stand properly at one side (countertop) of the kitchen because of the refrigerator. If your roommate has already taken the other side, you have to work on that smallest space beside the refrigerator. Kitchen trash bins were dirty when I moved in and the staffs refused to clean those although my roommate was away and not using it for a long.

3. Room heaters are useless. Specially the living room heater does nothing at all if there is a very high ceiling (3rd floor). Bedroom heater was not initially working too. After fixing, it's better (I had to argue with the staff to repair it). In 2021, you definitely deserve a better heater in a city that is oceanside. 

4. Bed mattress is extremely bad. It's a full size plush mattress that is smaller than the bed frame. So it keeps sliding all the day. Your bed sheet also keeps sliding because of the plastic kind of mattress cover. It's hard too, I will get a mattress topper/ pad. Come on San clemente! Couldn't you provide a better mattress? That's where your grad students sleep and think of research lol.

5. You cannot use a private router, which means you cannot use a personal wifi printer. Go with USB cable in 2021!!

The phone kept ringing and there were about 5-7 people that came in to pick up orders in the 15 minutes I was waiting. Even though they were super busy the gal behind the counter was really nice and even held the door open for me so I can carry out my box of food. Thank you!

GREAT FOOD! The vegetables were crispy. The beef was tender. Lots of flavor in everything and with non of the greasiness you get at other places. 

The Mongolian Beef is amazing and so flavorful. Melts in your mouth. I'm a wimp when it comes to spiciness so this was a bit spicy for me but so absolutely worth it. I will be ordering this regularly. 

The Snow Peas Pork was really good and I love how it was packed full of snow peas and water chestnuts. The barbecue pork in this is really good but the vegetables stole the show for me. Absolutely delicious. 

The beef chow mein was exactly as it should be. Not greasy, soft, with melt in your mouth beef. 

My husband said he liked the Hot & Sour soup and I take his word for it. 

Overall, fantastic experience and this is exactly the kind of mom-and-pop shop that we need to be supporting right now. Highly recommend you give them a try.

I had the covid test on the 16th and they said they could not find the results. Really?????
They put me in a room at 10am took my vital signs. No one came back there until almost 5pm when it was time for surgery.

At 2am I told the nurse to call the doctor because the pill they gave me did NOTHING. At 330 am I asked if the doctor called the nurse told me,""she is probably sleeping"". REALLY!!!!!This fool finally came in to see me at 630 am. She still did nothing.  NOT ONE PERSON ON THAT STAFF TOOK MY CONCERNS SERIOUSLY!!!!!   This is abandonment  of care.

My husband and I switched to AT & T from T-Mobile/Sprint on January 11th, 2021.  While at the store, we dealt with a particular customer service associate that we thought was helping us.  Now, we find we have been deceived in more ways than one.

1st issue:  We were told that if we traded in our phones, we would only have to put a small amount down for the new phones, and not owe a monthly fee per phone (I Phone 12 & Samsung Galaxy Note 20).  He neglected to tell us that this is not a buy back program, and that we would owe our prior company for those cell phones that were then traded into AT & T.  I find this to be extremely deceiving.  

2nd issue:  We were told that we would be paying $155/month for 2 lines with HBO Max (note he did not tell us about any plans without the HBO Max that are cheaper).  However, we just received our 1st bill in the mail with a due date of February 2nd, when we didn't even start with AT & T until January 11th and were told we wouldn't owe a bill for another 2 months.  Also, the $155 we were told we'd have to pay, somehow turned into a whopping $308! Tell me how this is ok?!  My husband called the store and spoke to this customer service associate.  The associate proceeded to explain why the charge would be $308, not $155.  He stated there is an activation fee per line which we were never told, as well as our phones that we now traded in (supposedly for a $700 credit on each phone) were not showing as traded in yet.  There is also supposed to be an additional discount through my work, that is not showing on the bill though I provided my pay stub at the store in order for that discount to be applied immediately, or so I thought.  

In Conclusion:
Why were we not told about any extra charges, even if they will eventually go away.  2nd of all, why weren't we told we would owe our old company for the phones he got us to trade into AT & T.  3rd:  Why weren't we told our options with the phone plans, instead of railroaded into the highest paying plan?  The service we received at this store with that associate is atrocious, and I would like something to be done about this!",2021-01-23 19:29:27,478,2191,

The woman in their office is the rudest most ignorant person I've had to deal with in a long time. Went down with my car for them to do an estimate on my car. I called the day before to confirm and ask if I could get estimate done then bring car home while they waited for the parts from Kia. The gentleman I spoke to said no problem since Kia is slow to ship parts and it's only the back bumper that's damaged. She first tried to tell me I didn't have an appointment. Then she said she worked the office and I must have called GEICO not them. When I told her no that I spoke to a gentleman she said no one answers the phone but her. Ok I guess I'm lying about the call. Then she said they don't write GEICO estimates she doesn't work for them. Funny it says GEICO on your building!! So she said she would take pictures and send them to GEICO, you know the company she doesn't work for? They'll be in touch. As I was leaving after all this a guy came out of the shop and said he'd take my car in first for the estimate. Probably the guy I spoke to on the phone..she told him no they weren't doing an estimate. Overall GEICO should be rethinking sending anyone there which I told them when I called to complain about her attitude and saying she doesn't work for GEICO.

The place has a nice vibe. Dark and trendy yet laid back. Masks were required and plexiglass separated tables.

We were pretty hungry, and our eyes are always bigger than our stomachs so we ordered A LOT:
Frozen strawberry lemonade $4
F.G.B.L.T. $11
Skillet garlic knots $9
Bianca $14.5
Crispy fried chicken wings $12.90
Pasta + red sauce with meatballs (kids) $8
Caesar salad (full) $11.5
Braised short rib $22
Warm chocolate budino $8
Perfect Pear $10
Bourbon and blue $10

We had a lovely server. Super nice and sweet. However, she kept forgetting items. For instance, I saw that they carried my favorite wine, Orin Swift 8 Years in the Desert and asked for a glass. My husband received his drink and a few of our apps and my wine had still not arrived to our table. We finally asked her about it. She went to the bar to check and came back to let us know that she meant to tell us that they don't serve that wine by the glass, just bottles. No problem. I was partly to blame because I just saw the name and didn't bother to check if it was available by glass or not. I ordered the perfect pear, which took another 15 minutes or so. I started to think she had forgotten again but alas, she brought it out. My pizza was also the last to be served. Our server apologized for the wait on the drinks and pizza, though.

Other than that, the food was delicious! Everything was flavorful. Great portions, too. Love their twist on classics, especially the FGBLT and caesar salad with egg. And that warm chocolate budino. Out of this world. We got it to go because our littles were sleepy by the time we finished our entrees, but it didn't make it out of the restaurant. Hubs and I took one bite and couldn't stop.

My son saw a car here he was interested in and communicated with ""Mike"" for a couple WEEKS about the car. On Tuesday he arranged with ""Mike"" to go to check out the car on Thursday between 12-1. We live about 2 hours away and we told Mike (when we were on our way) it would be closer to 1:00 to which he replied ""great, see you at 1:00."" Got there at 1:00...realized it was a seedy joint right away. Went in and about 4 different guys greeted us. We told them we were there to see Mike and they asked what car. Immediately the one guy asked if we wanted to look at anything else. Then another guy asked the same questions. We said we were waiting on Mike. One of the guys said the car we're looking at was at the dealer getting repairs done - wouldn't be done for a couple days. Still no Mike...I said how could we be communicating and scheduled this time to see this car, and of all days, the car is in the shop (which was a red flag also). We said forget it and left. The general manager ran out after us, I guess to apologize and see if there was anything he could do (yeah buddy, how bout a tank of gas or the vacation day I used to waste my time). He tried to tell me Mike worked in the internet sales dept and he didn't have access to when cars are being repaired. The whole place is as big as my small kitchen so wherever Mike from the internet sales dept was, I'll never know.

After we were waiting for a few minutes server came by and told us they were short of staff and just seat ourselves. Adjacent tables were closed, so no problem. Good to see social distancing.

There was a scan code on table for menu but soon the (apparently only) waitress came and brought disposable paper menus and took our drink order. Drinks came in a few minutes and we ordered our meals.

I ordered boneless wings with onion rings replacing fries, for an upgrade fee. I also asked for hot sauce on the side, for dipping. No problem, just an extra 60 cents. Others ordered a chicken sandwich meal and a tray of regular wings, mild.

BWW offers a list of 21 wet sauces from mild to Blazing Carolina Reaper. I opted for that one plus number 19, Mango Habanero. Unfortunately the waitress was correct. Our food took 30 minutes to arrive. However this gave us time to open gifts and celebrate a bit.

Food did arrive. The waitress was apologetic but we knew she was just overwhelmed. The food for my friends was on point, both agreed. My onion rings were crisp, hot and delicious. Sweet tea was ok and surprisingly refilled quickly. I tried dipping both sauces. The Mango Habanero had a little heat but too sweet for my taste. The Carolina Reaper was on point. Hot, yes pretty hot, but still let the chicken flavor through. Lol. My grandson tried one of his fries dipped in #21 and tried it. Only one fry.

Disappointing meal for the wait and this after going at 1:00 PM to avoid possible lunch crowds. But I do not fault the waitress and made sure she got a nice tip for the evident frustrations.",2021-01-02 21:54:18,346,1674,

I dropped off my son's $75 (replaceable value) REI snowsuit (blue, one piece, size 3T) on 11/07/2020. The zipper needed to be fixed. King Dry Cleaner's contacted to me approximately a week later to state that the cost of the zipper was going to be a total of $35 because it was a special zipper (not the quoted $25). I said ok, that is fine. Winter snow fall is right around the corner and I needed the zipper fixed.

Complaint: 
I never received another phone call from King Dry Cleaners. 

Today, 01/27/2021, my husband went to check on the 2 items I dropped off, and King Dry Cleaners informed him that the REI Snow Suit was gone. Yet, the second item that I dropped off (my daughter's winter formal gown) was still there. How ironic that an REI Snowsuit was missing yet a winter formal gown was there. The snow suit is half the size of the dress yet it magically disappeared.

I called King Dry Cleaners today 01/27/2021, when my husband informed me that the Snow Suit was gone. King Dry Cleaners stated, ""they couldn't fix the zipper and tried to call me.""

I explained to King Dry Cleaners that I wanted to see time stamp/ dates/ signatures of the staff member that supposedly called me to inform me that they couldn't fix the zipper. I call complete B.S. and feel that someone at King Dry Cleaners most likely stole the REI Snowsuit.

I have yet to hear from King Dry Cleaners and will next be filing a BBB complaint. 

I am extremely pissed and now have to spend another $75-$100 to replace the perfect REI snowsuit. If King Dry Cleaners wants to make this right, they need to reimburse me for the cost of the REI Snowsuit. 

Sincerely,
Brooke


UPDATE TO PREVIOUS POST: 
01/27/2021 @ 5:00pm 
The Owner at King Dry Cleaner contacted me and said that they would give me $30 to replace the snowsuit. I am satisfied with this dollar amount because the ultimate goal is for my son to play in the snow tomorrow. Wish me luck in finding a snowsuit.

Thank you for making this right.

Some of the servers are fantastic and a few of them are not. I realize finding help today is difficult, especially in the Treasure Valley area of Idaho.
Atmosphere: fantastic
Food: really good or really bad
Service: hit and miss
Parking: fair
Price: expensive, $37 for a burger and fish and chips with sides of fries and a soft drink. That's a $24 meal all day long. 

Today we ordered the fish and chips and the burger. The fish and chips were not on the menu but I asked and they said they always have fish and chips. They're probably using a scaled down menu which makes sense. My wife ordered the tavern burger with the sweet potato fries, which are always good. Today however she got a half order of fries and they said they would bring the other half back out. Normally this is not a problem except for the service being so hit and miss the fries didn't show up until the end of the meal. If you say you're going to bring fries out then the expectation for the customers is that they will be out within 3 to 5 minutes not 10 to 15.
As I mentioned, I ordered the fish and chips. They came out soggy and the fries were under cooked. After a few bites I could not continue. I had already received my flat sprite, which tasted like a cheap lemon soda. I thought to myself ""he goes another cruddy experience"". I mentioned it to the server and she took it back to the kitchen. Four other tables nearby got their food before my food came right back out. However, when they did come out the server explained that the batter that they used had the wrong beer mixture. My guess is they used an old stale batter but I have to say these were some of the best fish and chips I've ever had. This time they were cooked perfectly and the crispy batter was amazing. The fries that came with it were fully cooked and OK. The only negative here was that they brought a small plate of fries out just before the remake of the soggy fish and chips. Had we received the second fish and chips, the full plate of sweet potato fries, which did come towards the end and were delicious, and the great service this would've been a four-star experience. When the food is good it's really good, but when it's bad it's really bad.
Not sure I want to venture back here until they get the kinks worked out. My complaint is that they are inconsistent with the food, the service is great... Half the time, and the staff in the kitchen don'tt seem to be very experienced. When people have to remake their food you bring it out right away as a full complete meal not in pieces and parts. I realize that they're trying to make us happy, and they ultimately did in the end, but it took a very long time, And a few touch and goes.",2021-01-29 02:05:22,600,2785,

We love to stay at Hyatt hotel during our family trip and business trip around the world. We had a very good impression as soon as we arrived at Hyatt House. The lady at front desk Danielle was very helpful with the check in. It's like Townhouse style and you feel you are going back home. There was no elevator but it didn't matter and not a big deal. The room was great, clean and spacious.
Our stay experience has completed turned upside down during the breakfast in the morning. It's still pandemic time and the weather is cold. My aunt got the breakfast early in the morning for us so kids doesn't need to get down as well. The kids like the oatmeal so I went back to get more. The man named Luis who serves at the breakfast questions me when I went to get more oatmeal. He told me someone already cam and got the breakfast already. Excuse me??????? I told him I would like to get more oatmeal and can't I get it? He made me feel that it's our fault to have a good appetite. He told me to call my family. He then turned to his coworker in the back and spoke to him in Spanish and purposely said in English at the end ""yes they are the same people"". Unbelievable... It's kind of races and discrimination in my option. I looked around and people are also grabbing breakfast for their family members without getting a face. 
I am not sure how the staff believe that he can ask customer that way but I never experienced that at any of Hyatt we stayed. Sadly, We will never come back here and will not recommend our friends and family to come here. There are many more other Hyatt that you could stay and experience the REAL Hyatt hospitality without having a bad mood from staying experience.",2021-01-10 15:06:11,371,1755,

Maybe I didn't do my research. Maybe I was expecting something completely different. I've scrolled past this place several times on OpenTable and the pictures always make it look very appealing. When my girlfriend suggested we go last Saturday, my only concern was parking due to its location. However, when we walked down the sidewalk toward the front door and I could hear ""WAP"" by Cardi B blasting from inside; it was at that moment I knew we made a mistake. Now, this is where my review may be slightly unfair. This restaurant is located on 21st Ave, right next to Vanderbilt. I should have anticipated the college-aged students dancing while standing at the bar and taking pictures before they sipped each drink. The host tried to seat us right in the middle of a huge party, so we made our way to the bar. The bartender greeted us and politely asked that we scan the QR code for the menu. She came back a short time later and we ordered our appetizer, it's around 3:15. That's when she said they were on brunch until 4. Not a problem. It was then I noticed the tables flowing with mimosas and now I understand the appeal to all the local Vandy students. We ordered our app, the wings; not bad. Our waitress didn't come back, but another bartender. It's around 3:50 at this time. We were given plenty of time to decide that we'd like to try the Brunch Burger. He looked at his watch and told us they were no longer on brunch and have moved to their dinner menu. I laughed, he seemed confused, and we told him we needed more time. The female bartender returned once more to ask us what else we'd like to drink. My girlfriend politely replied we weren't sure yet. We never spoke with her again! She would look over at us, say something to the other bartender and then he'd come over. We both had burgers, nothing special but not bad either. The fries were great. I can see the appeal of this place to a younger crowd. Extended brunch hours, obnoxiously loud music, etc. It wasn't for us though. Again, maybe that's what we get for choosing a place in such close proximity to Vanderbilt and on a nice Saturday. I do enjoy brunch, I really do. I also enjoy a good service, which we only received about half the time.",2021-01-05 18:24:26,496,2318,

While it was expensive, we felt it was worth the investment to keep ourselves and our family safe.  The initial process of being shown the RV and making the reservation went very well and they answered all the questions we had.  

My reason for the 1-star review is this.  When we rented the RV, we were told that no one would be in the office the DAYof our return - Monday, December 28, 2020.  We were not told that no one would be there the entire week to check in the vehicle after we'd returned it.  As such, it sat on their lot for 7 days and nights with no one checking it in.  On January 4th, I received a notice that I would have to pay for damage to the ladder on the rear of the RV.  Having not damaged the ladder, I wasn't sure what they were referring to, so I asked for pictures.  The bottom of the ladder was bent out as if something had pulled on it from the bottom rung.  Total for the repair was about $166

Since I believed someone would be checking it in the morning after I returned it, I didn't bother with taking pictures or a video of the vehicle when I dropped it off.  As such, I'm now responsible for the damage that was done (even though I didn't do it).  No proof = my fault I suppose.  

I've been told that they ""bent"" their normal policy so I wouldn't have to pay for unused nights.  Apparently the bend in the policy didn't include someone coming to check the vehicle in the next day.

Then at the end of the semester my son failed his course because no actions were taken after all the screams for help. He was unable to find where his assignments and tests were.  After he failed, now it became nasty. The disabilities office knew exactly that he needed help during the term but refused to help him sent him a questionnaire asking if he had a laptop, internet, and everything. In other words, they schemed to put all the blames on everything else to cover their inactions.  People with disabilities are vulnerable, and this office which is funded to help them instead tried to put him into a trap. They were successful. As a result, my son thinks he is retarded, and he does not have the ability to go to college.  From the way they communicated with my son, I can tell this is exactly what the disabilities office wanted.  Each time he went to them to get help, they always put him down and telling him untruthful stuff that made him feel hopeless about himself.  If you have disabilities, avoid this community college.

Being pregnant and all, I can always snack on something so we decided to hit up Bar Louie. 

Scanned their menu and saw that they had decent bar bites/appetizer options, which was perfect. He went with the chicken quesadillas and I ordered the salmon sliders with tots. 

Babe said the quesadillas were spicy but good and didn't lack chicken at all. The salsa that came on the side look liked it was made in house. I didn't try it but he said it was great with a somewhat sweet and tangy taste. This wasn't a basic quesadilla and I'm basing that off it's size!  

My salmon sliders (minus the onions) were pretty good. I liked that they used arugula versus lettuce, and the sauce that looked like tarter sauce but wasn't gave the sliders its flavor. I have been eating way too many potatoes here lately, specifically french fries, but they had tots so I couldn't resist. They were hot and fresh. The side of bbq I asked for accompanied them well. 

The food was solid and some of the other plates that passed by looked decent as well. I say it's worth a comeback... 

I debated between a grade of 3.5 - 4 as I feel like they should have a sign saying ""seat yourself"" instead of making us (and others) have to wait to be told that and/or for one of their busy staff to have to relay that message.

I prepare myself to try something out of the ordinary, not offered anywhere else, and handcrafted, right? Well that was not what I got at Noble Roman's craft Pizza. The ordering was awesome. Lady on the phone was extremely helpful and very friendly. In the midst of the pandemic we chose the drive through option to pick up our pizza. The young lady at the window greeted me immediately and was extremely nice.  However, her face mask was below her chin, not covering her chin mouth or nose. And she was the one opening the boxes and checking the orders. This was the first time we ordered here so we kept it simple with the deluxe pizza and breadsticks. The breadsticks were very soft and actually tasted very good but they coat them with cornmeal which is absolutely unnecessary. It really just made the breadstick uncomfortable to eat because little pieces of cornmeal were getting stuck in your teeth. I'm really not sure what the corn meal did to the breadstick or what purpose it served but for us it was just not necessary. The ""craft"" pizza could easily be compared to Little Caesars. There was no craft to this pizza. Basic ingredients basic cheeses basic construction. .... Nothing was handcrafted about this pizza that made it stand out from any other pizza place. In fact, it didn't sit well, hours later, with either of us. It had the same gastrointestinal effect on both of us.

We came late (8pm, or a little after, I'd guess) on a Sunday evening, and early cleanup was in progress.  Late hour may account for some of the food issues.  

Drinks:

Out of strawberries for wife's preferred margarita, but passionfruit alternative suggested by bartender was good - it just wasn't very frozen.  They use slushy machines, so not sure why that was - it was still good, though.  Cool night - if it had been hot out, this would have been liquid fast.

I tried the smoked tequila old-fashioned, and it was a good surprise.  I'm a bourbon drinker, and wasn't sure if I'd like this.  It clearly wasn't bourbon, but it was delicious and definitely rang the ""old fashioned"" bell.  I'll definitely order again.  Presentation was interesting - they serve it on a plank that has been scorched, and glass is inverted over the smoking scorch mark to fill with smoke.  Tis is brought to the table, and glass is turned up, a big ice cube is and garnish is dropped in, and the drink is poured from a small pitcher into the glass.  Very fancy service, and definitely a winner.

Apps: 

Chorizo with Queso Fundido (chips and queso with chorizo) was a big disappointment (and a pricey one, almost $12).  We left most of this.  This was supposed to be manchego cheese sauce, but sauce was very yellow (see photos), way too thick, and had a gritty, floury texture like an undercooked mornay sauce.  My guess is that they were out of manchego tonight and had to get creative.  I understand this sort of thing happens, but when it does, I'd like to be told that I was getting a substitution when I order.  Or in this case, I'd have like to be told to steer clear and come back when the regular recipe is available.

(Note: I checked Yelp photos, and this definitely was not their normal queso - which looks fantastic!  Hopefully this was a one-time issue).

On to the tacos!

Mushroom taco wife had was fantastic - I'm, ordering one for myself next time.  It was missing the manchego cheese - but it was still very good.  

I tried a trio recommended by our server (they are big, two would have been enough and I'm a big eater): 

Volcan Carne Asada - big chunks of steak, crispy bacon, avocado, and cheese sauce (again, it was yellow and the least favorite  part of this one - menu said manchego) on a fried tostada - in spite of the cheese issue, this one was a definite hit, and I'll be back for another.

Carnitas - tasty, but meat had that ""been sitting around a while"" thing going on that makes me think it hadn't been a busy day, or they were keeping it around a little longer than optimum - or maybe keeping it uncovered on a steam table where it gets dried out on top.  Just wasn't fresh.

Beef barbacoa - again, a very good taco, but meat seemed a little stale, like the carnitas.

Overall this is reading worse than the overall experience.  We still enjoyed the meal, the store is fresh and new and inviting, the bar and patio have a cool setup, the location is great, parking situation is very good, and the guys that waited on us were very friendly and helpful.

Solid three, and if the food had come out fresh and as advertised, it would be a 4.  I'll update after my next visit - may have just caught them late on a bad day.",2021-01-11 17:36:53,743,3389,

I decided against delivery to avoid the ridiculous fees, and tried to call them to ask if they were allowing indoor seating yet(Philly just lightened the restrictions today). I was met with an automated voicemail and sat through the whole useless thing expecting to be able to talk to a person at the end, but turns out, your only options are to hear the message again, hangup, or text them.
At this point I was over it and wanted to just go somewhere simpler, but decided to text the number since I was told the pizza was great. 
All of that was for nothing though, because they don't have indoor dining anyway, and while I don't mind walking all the way there to avoid the delivery charge, if I can't eat there, my food would be cold by the time I walked all the way back. Sorry that I couldn't give this place a fair rating on its actual food, but trying to contact them is more trouble than it's worth and I'll be finding my lunch elsewhere.",2021-01-05 17:01:50,318,1448,

When I was a kid, it was customary for my family to go out to Chinese and we would order certain dishes to bring in luck. Usually duck, seafood and noodles. Trying to carry on a tradition, I went here because my favorite Chinese restaurants are not open for sit down. This place got such high reviews that I thought it would be fantastic.  Well, if Uncle Roger from Tik Tok was with us, he would definitely be asking some questions. Why are scallops so heavily breaded and when did lemon sauce become orange?  If you decide to try this place, two dishes you should not order, lemon scallops and roast duck.  I have always ordered scallops and they usually are U10 or 20 size, and I don't expect a huge quantity. When the dish came out, it wasn't what I was expecting.  Usually scallops are lightly coated and pan fried with lemon and garlic. This was an  unrecognizable mess that you would never be able to tell what you are eating.  All I tasted was breading--no scallops. At $20 a dish, give me 5 scallops and prepare it correctly.  Bad on you Fortune Palace for trying to disguise your small u30/40 scallops.  The duck I ordered was really fatty, no meat and no Chinese five spice flavor. I know duck is a fatty meat and that is ok, but this duck was not fresh tasting and I think they threw the old duck in the fryer to pass it off as roasted. Now, if you stick to the Mongolian beef and chicken  pan fried noodles, that was actually very good. The fried rice is meh and the char sui pork was just ok.  I don't think I will come back. Two reasons, the quality of the food was sub par, they call this Fortune Palace, because it cost a fortune to eat here for the quality they serve.  I really do not like restaurants that cut corners. Will not be a repeat customer. So sad, and that pretty much summed up 2020.",2021-01-01 17:46:16,407,1885,

I will not be recommending them to anyone after this unprofessional experience.

Situation I had was a regular 3k oil change and needed my rear mud flaps installed. (Misty took care of me with the same exact service about a year ago and it went smoothly.) I had called and spoke to Hugo to set the service up and mentioned the flaps. Took the vehicle in and was called a couple hours stating it was ready. Mud flaps were not installed. No biggie, Hugo was great and apologized. They took the vehicle to the shop and installed them within 20min. Few days later I hear something dragging in the rear. I inspect the vehicle and notice the right rear flap had came off. It's gone. I send Misty an email and she immediately gets back to me and asks for a picture of the rally armor mud flaps retailing for $174.99.

I wait a few days before Hugo gets back to me and tells me the Service Manager Robert Dowd will not compensate me for the flaps and will only cover the installation on new flaps when I purchase them. That's unacceptable. I ask Hugo to have Robert Dowd call me at his convenience and I get no response for 5 days. I had to email Misty once again to get any legitimate answers. Subaru is wrong for not taking the responsibility of compensating for the lost rear mud flap that was installed incorrectly. 

I held this business at a high standard after being a customer for many years. I'm very disappointed with this experience. Don't bring your vehicle in for any kind of service besides an oil change because this is the service you will receive. Robert Dowd should understand where I'm coming from as a customer and if he knew about customer service he would compensate me for my inconvenience and make this experience better. As of now I rather speak to the General Manager because I can't rely on Dowd for even a phone call back.",2021-01-07 06:20:47,401,1999,

I have been there well over 20-times before and I plan on returning again and again! The service is always so quick and the waitstaff is very kind and attentive to all guest needs. The waitstaff is also very observant to returning guests and will ask how they are doing and usually already know their food order or at least their drink order! This is the kind of service you don't get at many restaurants and yet another reason this place is my #1 favorite Mexican restaurant! 

The entire menu is great! - that's not to say that I have had everything on the menu, but of the many things that I have had from the menu, I have never once been disappointed. This goes for both food and drinks - the bartender is absolutely amazing and makes great margaritas and mixed drinks! This is where I had my first ever ""CoronaRita"" and it was the best one I have ever had. Since then I have gotten skinny margaritas, tequila shots, and draft beers - all of which were amazing. The food is great - the chips are always warm and the salsa is always fresh - and you must get an order of queso! Definitely look into their lunch specials and their daily dinner specials, this usually includes some kind of drink special too! 

Writing this review, my mouth is watering because I haven't had lunch yet today and I wish I were going there!  I can't wait to go back and next time I will add photos of my drinks, and food! If you were hesitant at first, this is your sign to not be!",2021-01-05 19:42:24,326,1560,

Online reservation the night before was quick and easy, and the person helping me at the front desk once I arrived this morning was courteous, informative and helpful.  I think his name was Brandon.  The wait was reasonable - only about an hour and a half - so I was in and out fairly fast.  Indoor seating is properly spaced for social distancing and there's hand sanitizer on each table.  Clean and orderly.  The bad part was this: upon getting my vehicle, I noticed that the stem caps weren't tightened at all.  No big deal, but one was barely screwed on at all and could've fallen off with a little driving; it was that loose.  Worse, there was some type of greasy residue along the edge of each of my tire rims.  I drove up to a service bay before leaving the parking lot and spoke with a technician - I believe the same guy who checked me out at the register just a few minutes earlier.  He took a look and said he had no idea what it was and suggested the rims were already like that when I brought my car in.  I explained that they definitely were not, as I take meticulous care of my new (only a little over a year old) BMW and frequently polish my chrome.  He then said he supposed it could be from when they performed the tire installation but didn't offer an apology or any suggestions.  I get it - things can get dirty in a tire shop, but I have never gotten new tires installed where my rims came back greased up like this.  Not at this store location (I've purchased tires here before and also had tire siping done), Tire Rack or anywhere else.  The technicians need to be much more careful with customers' property, especially when they're handling upgraded rims on a luxury vehicle that cost thousands and the customer just paid nearly $1,400 for a set of new tires.  I don't say that to sound elitist; it's just that I work hard for my money and I take care of my belongings.  Had to go to Pep Boys for a wheel brush and extra wheel cleaning solution and spent an hour at the car wash scrubbing the grease/residue off each rim instead of relaxing at home on my day off (MLK holiday).  Fingers crossed they're more mindful and considerate when I bring my car back in for tire rotation service.  Five stars for the front desk customer service, 1 star or zero stars for the actual tire service which was careless.  Two stars overall.  Attached is a photo of one of the rims - not the worst because I had already scrubbed the other three before I remembered to take a photo.",2021-01-19 02:55:50,526,2527,

I wanted both panels cut and hemmed, so that in the end I would have four panels: three 50"" w x 36"" l, and one 50""w x 48""l.  It was a little hard for the man to get what I wanted by he seemed to.  He said the cost would be $60.  I said this was twice the cost of the curtains so he said $50, and if I paid cash there would be no tax.  (Should have been a red flag.)  I came in today to pick the curtains up; unfortunately did not check these until I got home, when I saw there were only two panels, not four.  I returned to the store, thinking there would be a second hanger with my two other curtains.  To make a long story short, after much discussion, with the P&J family telling me I wanted something for nothing, I wanted just to retrieve my panels to take them somewhere else, and I wanted half the cost returned, or $25.  The family accused me of wanting something for nothing, I said I only wanted what was promised.  I said if he didn't simply return the unfinished pieces and the $25 I would go to the police (knowing this wasn't a criminal issue) and would give an appropriate review.  They called the police and I told my side of the story.  They were unable to get my $25 back, only the unfinished curtains.  I would be very careful about using P&J.  He may be a good tailor but I think his ability to comprehend what a customer wants is impaired.

The margherita pizza is excellent. Authentic and reminds me of some of the smaller pizza shops in NYC. Thin style, fresh basil, San Marzano tomatoes, etc. Very fresh. For those who haven't had this kind of pizza before, you might be in for a sticker shock with how small the pizza is for $16. It's definitely more of a ""personal pizza"" size, although could be shared between two people with an appetizer.

I also tried one of their meat variations of pizza, and wasn't horribly impressed. It was basically a margherita with sliced sausage on top, and the sausage wasn't particularly flavorful (it was supposed to be 'spicy', but was not). I'd stick to just the regular margherita next time.

The only other food I've tried from Matteo was a Caesar salad. The Caesar looked/tasted like one of those bagged salad kits you get at the grocery (and it might have been). It was nothing special and for $9 it was way overpriced. I would not order again.

Overall, I'm a big fan of their Regina Margherita pizza as there's not too many places to get this type of higher quality authentic marg pizza in the Tampa Bay area. Everything else I've tried hasn't impressed me as much, but I' be curious to try their bianche pizzas and their pasta dishes as well. Maybe after the COVID curve finally drops, I'll even visit in-person.",2021-01-14 00:54:40,313,1461,

Just look for the neon sign (see photo) that says J's Lobster & Fish Market hanging down from the ceiling to find it inside the hall.  J's seemed to be the most busiest so we thought we would start with them.

I had trouble deciding what to try first on the menu.  There were several items, such as the Sesame Asian Power Bowl and the Lobster B.L.T. I would love to try but I opted to go with a safe bet of the Fish & Chips.  The order taker told me the ""Crab Cakes Served on a Bed of Fries"" is very popular especially during the dinner hour.

The fish sandwich which they call Fish Sammich was really good.  A big thick portion of fried cod fish (you can choose fried or grilled) on a really good fresh Brioche roll.  The fish was fried while we waited so it was nice and hot and very tender.  The fries were battered, seasoned and good.  A side of Ketchup and Cole Slaw is included in your basket.  I didn't care for the Cole Slaw but she liked it.  The taste of the slaw was kind of a tangy sweet vinegar taste.  It was okay, just different than what I am used to.  The sammich was a bit messy with the lettuce, pickles and mayo so I would advise to get some extra napkins.  My better half ended up eating her's with a fork.

We also ordered a Hush Puppie Basket (you get five) which comes with a side of tangy tartar sauce.  They were extra crispy on the outside but very soft on the inside and looked like they had a few green onions in them.  She thought they were perfect, I would have liked a few more onions.  Don't be put off by their appearance in my photo; they were cooked perfectly!

The entire meal with soft drinks and tip cost us $54.  A little expensive for lunch but nice once in awhile to splurge on trying new places with cool ambience.

My husband and I finally ate here last week and loved it. We sat outside in the tent with heaters next to each table. It was 30° outside and freezing but we were still warm enough inside the tent for a comfortable meal. The server was amazing and helped us with menu choices. 

First course we had the snapper Crudo, which was phenomenal. I could have eaten several more plates of that! We also had the Fried mozzarella which came in a stack with a toothpick on it.. it was almost like a cheese popsicle.. so cool and delicious!! 

The second course we shared these 4 main plates which were all amazing, but in order of our preference: 
1. Robiolina sacchetti with apricot and walnut  pesto was MIND BLOWING!! It was like ""pockets of heaven"" we called it! I was drooling over this. The best thing we have tasted in a long time. See photos! 
2. The ricotta stuffed in gnocchi was also amazing! They were huge and the inside had a soft delicious ricotta stuffing much different than your average gnocchi dish. 
3. Rigatoni Ragu my husband LOVED it, but I thought it was pretty good. But he's the ragu fan, not me, and he said it was some of the best he's had. 
4. The Cacio e Pepe was amazing, very traditional and delicious. I like it more than my husband did but it was still very good.

For dessert we had the tiramisu gelato which came with mascarpone and Lady fingers. It was also ridiculous and worth every calorie. I was licking up every drop with the spoon.

My one regret is that I went at such a popular time (12:00 pm on a Saturday). For starters, it is located on the main drag in Broad Ripple, with metered parking very much hit or miss. That said, the establishment itself is hard to miss as the outside is painted bright blue. 

Immediately upon walking in the doors I felt overwhelmed with everything going on. There was about 15 people standing around waiting for their orders, a small line of people waiting to order, and several employees behind the counter working diligently to churn out as many sandwiches as possible.

The menu is very extensive (almost daunting) for a first timer. They have all the options written on big boards behind the counter. As I started to make my way around in attempt to read all the options, one of the employees graciously pointed out that they had physical copies of the menu on top of the counter. 

After looking through some of the options, I finally decided just to ""phone a friend"" and ask the employee for advice. I was in the mood for a southwest chipotle style lunch sandwich and he pointed my attention to the ""Skeep"", which is an everything bagel topped with turkey, bacon, chipotle cream cheese, provolone cheese, avocado and honey mustard.

My order was ready after about 20 minutes. One downside is that the inside is relatively small and narrow (only 3-4 tables, all on one side), which made it fairly crowded for those waiting.

The bagel itself was very tasty and the chipotle cream cheese added good flavor. They also steam the hot sandwiches which gives it soft, warm texture.  

Overall, the food was worthy of 5 stars, but the overwhelming atmosphere during peak hours along with wait time (obviously, both things that could be avoided with a little planning) make this place worthy of 4 stars in my book.",2021-01-23 19:07:11,389,1926,

A regression to primal instincts and a final release to the euphoric abyss of the Chipotle steak burrito enveloping my mouth. My pupils were suddenly birds penetrating through the barricade of my eyelids. I was asleep, yet awake. Blind yet I could see all. Deaf to every noise except for the annoying screech of that song by Lizzo that was playing on the restaurant radio. Complete and utter bliss. Why would I open my eyes? Why would I continue to chew when it daringly warrants the fate of the bite departing from my taste buds?

All these trivial thoughts died out when I was jolted out of euphoria when the restaurant manager turned up the tv volume to a blaring setting. It was so loud that it was virtually impossible to ignore it. I stared with a sort of unrecognized duty to remain attentive to the content inside the screen. The news station was playing. They discussed the 3 car pileup on the interstate and then the investigation of the murder homicide that took place two nights before. I suddenly felt as though I had seen it all before. When the newscaster switched to the weather segment, my heart began pounding faster. The weatherman said, ""Today we have a cold front coming through..."" Today... Today was Monday. If I'm not mistaken, yesterday had been Monday as well. Had the day before that been Monday? No this all is impossible and I don't need to worry myself... As I started to think about it some more, I muttered, ""But what if..."" All of a sudden every person in that Chipotle restaurant had their eyes fixated on me. I couldn't move. Their gaze paralyzed every part of my body. I couldn't close my eyes and make it all go away. I glanced at the tv which had gone quiet and soon realized why. The lady newscaster had begun staring at me as well. And as a break in the silence, she said my name. ""Shane."" I tried to respond but I still could not move. Once again she said my name, ""Shane."" And before I could devise up a way to respond she continued, ""Honey... this is your mom and dad."" My heart sank lower than the hardwood floor. I dismissed this thought with ease because my parents had died a decade ago in a car accident. ""We miss you. Come home to us. I know that you're confused but we don't know exactly how this message will get through to you. We just need you to WAKE UP!"" All I wanted to do was close my eyes to this dream and thus end it because I was mortified. ""You've been in a very bad car accident sweetie and it put you in a coma. But now it's time for you to WAKE UP! Come back to us."" At this point, tears were flowing down the face of the newscaster and she could hardly speak with a straight tone anymore. After 9-10 seconds she continued the newscast solemnly. The people in the restaurant were still staring deep into my soul. Under my breath, I repeated what the lady newscaster had told me. ""Wake up..."" As if on cue, every person in the restaurant, man woman and child, began to approach me with purpose. They reached their arms out to me. I still couldn't move. I couldn't prevent the onslaught of hands that was growing near. They began to surround me and place their hands on my shoulders and neck. And finally, in unison, they commanded me to, ""WAKE UP!""

Blindingly bright were the surgical lights overhead. I realized quickly that my body was strapped down with two thick leather belts fastened tightly. I was now in a hospital room. I could hear my own heartbeat as though it were broadcast through the loudspeakers. I heard a woman cry, ""Oh my God! Oh my God!"" and I glanced to my left and saw a woman, my mother running to my side. ""He's awake!"" I heard the doctors rush into the room with shocked smiles and put their hands all over him, unplugging some tubes, unstrapping belts, and allowing me more room to move. As I stared into my mom's eyes I heard another woman's cry at the doorway. I glanced to my right and saw a woman carrying a baby. Tears began to flow from her eyes and she ran to the bedside next to my mother. She pressed her forehead against mine and I knew at that moment who she was. She was my wife. This was my child. She gently handed me the baby, my eyes fixated on his innocent face. Tears began to race down my cheeks as I looked into the eyes of a human who I had given life to.

Overall, I'd give the Virtual Comatose Simulation at the hospital a 3/5. They didn't even let me finish my Chipotle steak burrito.",2021-01-16 06:05:29,974,4483,

* Minimum order for no-charge for curbside pickup is $35.00 rather than Raley's $100.  Target has no minimum.
* Can easily add items to an order already placed providing it is done before midnight for pickups the next day.  Cannot do this at Raley's
* Has an app to allow customer to text the store to indicate ""I am on my way for curbside pickup.""  I then send a second text to inform the store I have arrived.  The items are brought to the car with minimal wait.  
* Smith's sends me a text to remind me of my schedule curbside pickup.
* Smith's sends me a text to notify of items not in stock for items I ordered and offers substitutions.  I don't know what is out of stock at Raley's until I get home and examine what I actually picked up.
* Parking spots for pickup are more clearly designated.
* Smith's accepts (encourages) coupons at time of curbside pickups.
* Smith's actually answers the phone at the time of pickup while at Raley's we have received message the phone mailbox is full!
* Smith's has a drive-up window for pharmacy pickup.  Raley's requires me to either go to the back of the store for pharmacy pickups or requires me to make an appointment to schedule an outside pickup.

* When we shop at Target, there is no minimum purchase.  Target's app actually tracks our car for curbside pickup after we indicate on their app we are on the way for curbside pickup.

If you need or are looking for any decor items, speciality gifts, local items (including sweets!) and/or an assortment of older or antique items or furniture, this is your place. There's even a small cooler with unique drinks in the corner. 

I started following the shop on Instagram ages ago. So I was thrilled that they are close to my relocated area. The first time I was in the shop was honestly to only grab flowers to brighten a friend's day. Yet, I ended up walking out with an assortment of things - ribbon tape, soap, some candles, hand cream, Edmonton trivia cards, etc. Small but unique or local items always makes good gifts! I love so many things in this store and recommend this place if it's gift giving items you're looking for or even the extra self love/care items. I've shopped here for gifts that I felt I could further customize for friends and family or add to a group gift to enhance the selected theme. 

The staff is always very helpful when they see me looking at the displays or carrying multiple items (I walk with a cane so I appreciate their concern of I can hold onto something for a time). I've even suggested this place to others to stop at when they come to Edmonton as it's a very pretty store just to pop into quickly for future inspiration.

Most recently I've bought myself bouquet filter to fix my seasonal bouquet (sadly the seasonal element to a Christmas bouquet was severely lacking from a different store - people let this be a lesson on you get what you pay for). The ladies suggested some items I wouldn't of even thought to consider or ask for. Some really cool red berry looking thing too. Happily I can report that adding those suggestions plus what I wanted together with the flowers I already had resulted in an amazing amount of virtual complements during the holiday. Plus I got what I really was looking for - that real tree smell in my little apartment! I recently had to reduce the filler in my vase to only the pine. So I can confirm their product lasts a good amount of time or longer than expected. I've brought multiple bouquets and floral items from them in the last couple of years and everyone I've gifted a bouquet has said the same thing.

If I could give a 4.5 I would as seriously this place. It truly is a great as a store and the shop for the most part is arranged to give a lots of space to move around. This was before only a few people were allowed in at a time (covid restrictions). They even have the most lovely shop dog. Hand sani out at the front and easy to read signs.

It's honestly the parking lot that makes it go down a point. As someone that is mobility limited, I don't enjoy the real life game of frogger. Especially in winter amongst cars entering quickly off  the corner of Whyte ave and 96 St into the uniquely shaped and noticeably slopped parking lot. To make things really challenging for drivers (and shoppers trying to get to and from cars), there's one access point parking lot. Lots of times you see people backing up further into the lot or back on the street to get another car out or into the parking lot. So drive with caution, especially when reversing.

Yes, there's a handicap stall and a few other spots near the door but that's usually the first to be taken. Especially if it's a long weekend. I don't mind trying to challenge myself from time to time with walking distances but it's the slope in the parking lot that personally makes me nervous in winter due to my lack of balance.

The unique parking situation is not the shop's fault. One assumes from the look of the building, the footprint is definitely from the older days. Do keep in mind if you choose to park there, that the lot is shared with Earth's General Store. As you can imagine, being connected to a small and unique grocery store creates a very busy parking lot with usually few people waiting to go inside (due to limited number of customers allowed at one time). So if you can bike, bus or walk over, I would recommend it. Bike rack is located along the dividing wall that leads to the sister store of Maven and Grace. Bus stop is literally as close as you can get for a bus stop on Whyte Ave. I have also noticed the last few months a lot of people parking in the Humpty's lot across the street or along the other side of Whyte Ave (so not to be in the bus zone) and walking over. 

All in all, the shop itself is awesome to find that perfect gift or brighten your own day with something a little special.",2021-01-13 03:57:09,937,4499,

My wife had the Chicken BLT Avocado Wrap with ""grilled"" chicken. The term ""grilled"" was loosely used as the chicken was either roasted in the oven or ""grilled"" on a flat top, either way it was cut in large pieces, more that what you would normally bite instead of being 'sliced"" it was also dry. In the time that our order came out, the chicken was not cooked to order and merely reheated, hence the dryness. The avocado was barely present. My wife actually unwrapped it to see if there was actually avocado in the wrap. She did find what accumulated to about 1/8th of an avocado. She also asked for mayo to put on the sandwich to help with the dryness. There wasn't evidence of any dressing/condiment/sauce in the wrap, but noted, it wasn't mentioned on the menu, only an assumption that there would have been, but then again perhaps if there was more avocado, it would have helped.
As I mention, the fries were the deciding factor. Fresh fries aren't hard to do so I'm not sure why a restaurant would choose to use a frozen fry. and this brand had to be the worst french fry we ever had, including bake in the oven at home fries. The coating on the fry that helps retain crispness was on the sweet side. It did it's job keeping them crisp and the fries did come out hot.
Service was lackluster, just humdrum. The hostess was friendly and efficient.
All in, it wouldn't be on our list to return.",2021-01-07 00:14:25,376,1704,

I purchased an INFINITI QX60 and within a month my headlights got moisture in them and went out. INFINITI replaced the headlights the first time, but now the issue has come back. The service manager at Willow Grove INFINITI dealership Chris told me that in 2020, INFINITI decided they would no longer replace the headlight assembly due to moisture in the headlights. They changed their policy AFTER my purchase, which was in 2019. Now I'm driving around with moisture in my headlights and don't know when my lights will completely go out again. Chris told me that if I want my headlight assembly replaced, they will charge me $2,138 for each side to replace it. This is completely outrageous. Also, I'm still within my 50,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty and they are not honoring it. I don't have 2k to fix this, especially when this will continue to happen. Chris admitted to me that based upon the headlight design, moisture in the headlights will happen ""from time to time"". Who is their right mind would make a car that gets recurring moisture in the headlight assembly? That's stupid and unsafe. I could be driving around and at any time, lights out, putting my safety and my family's safety at risk. INFINITI is no longer standing behind their vehicles. Please research and google ""mositure in headlights infiniti""... this is a big problem with their vehicles. These vehicles probably need to be recalled completely but INFINITI refuses to do the right thing. I'm so disappointed and frustrated.",2021-01-12 18:40:54,307,1583,

Anyhow, to the poke. I got what I usually do - a sumo poke bowl w/ 2x ahi and 2x salmon, white rice & kelp noodle base, w/ signature sauce, sriracha ponzu, and spicy garlic 911, red & green onions, cucumbers, a little jalapeño, along with seaweed salad and crab salad, topped w/ sesame seeds and furikake. 

If I'm splurging, I'll request a spicy Mayo drizzle on top and eel sauce on the crab. Today my splurge was a strawberry slushie (sorry I drank most of it b4 the pic). :p

The thing that always gets me w/ these bowls is how heavy they are when handed over. I almost feel guilty (for those frozen yogurt fans out there, you know what I'm talking about). 

It seems like an insanely good deal for the amount of sashimi grade ahi and sushi they pack in. Especially when compared to what I spend (or used to spend when they were open) at sushi restaurants, in order to actually get full! Like 5x as much $$$!

Highly recommend this place to any sushi or poke fans out there. The staff is cool, I kinda know them all by now. It's certainly nice to see some people still employed (and not stuck on a screen), and the morale seems good which speaks to the management.

Thank you PokeCeviche for packing this bowl, and the ones to come in the future! ;) Namaste.",2021-01-25 16:04:32,326,1441,

The experience in the igloo was nice however, the small heaters that they provided weren't kicking off any heat.  Mind you it was pretty cold that night (12/26).  We notice a few people asking to sit inside because it was just not warm enough.  Me and the family stuck it out.  You'll notice in the pics most of us kept our coats on. 

Anyway, our hostess (Derrick) was gracious.  Striking up a conversation with us until our Igloo was ready.  Once ready, he walked us through the restaurant to the back where you saw several plastic like bubbles (hence the igloos). BTW, everyone was masked up, waiters had gloves on. We ordered electronically by scanning the bar code on the tables.

Once inside, the igloo had a flat screen TV and a small heater.  At first we moved the heater closer thinking it would get warm....Nah...not for us.  We stuck it out and ordered hot drinks.

 Our waitress Carlie, was friendly and prompt. She took our order of the Apple Cider Fireballs.

Our Apps: Cauliflower bites and crab cake.  The cauliflower was spicy just the way we like it.  Crab cakes were good as well.

Entrees:  Grill Cheese and soup, Cancun Shrimp and Teriyaki Salmon

We decided to share a slice of cheesecake for dessert and to our surprise we see Carli entering the Igloo with a rainbow cake for my birthday.  What a nice surprise.  Thank you Germantown Garden, Carli and Derrick for creating great memories on my special day.",2021-01-08 14:28:25,325,1618,

Took the five minute walk down Fairview and walked through the door, where we my grandkids and I were  cheerfully greeted by the wait staff (all wearing masks). We arrived right before the lunch crowd did and I was pleasantly and happily surprised to see the restaurant start to fill up. This is a popular place. Even with more customers coming in, there was no lag in the excellent service, drinks were always refilled, including my delicious hot tea. And of course the tables were distanced enough apart to abide by the safe Covid 19 restrictions. 

We ordered from the lunch menu: chasui ramen, a bento box, a sushi plate and mixed tempura appetizer. 
The tempura shrimp and vegetables  was nice and crispy with a delicious dipping sauce that my 11 year old grand son described as ""amazing"". He had ordered the bento box with a California sushi roll and 7 different sushi pieces. My 9 year grand daughter ordered the 5 piece sushi plate. They both struggled with their chopsticks, and upon seeing this, our server brought over some ""kid friendly"" starter chopsticks for them. The sushi was fresh, beautiful and tasty. They tried the salmon, red snapper and tuna. 

I have not had ramen in a long time so I was looking forward to my order.  The ramen came in a generous sized bowl with a tonkatsu broth that was, to mimic my grandson, ""amazing"". They simmer the broth for over 10 hours to pull as much flavor form the pork bones as they can. The care they take I developing the broth makes it the star of the dish. There was a generous portion of Chashu pork floating the dish as well as a seasoned soft boiled egg.  The whole meal was delicious and I look forward to revisiting this place as often as I can.

Could be cleaner but I'm sure that will change once they move to the new location. I went in to have a few jewelry pieces repaired, one of which was a pearl earring where the stud piece fell off. I gave her the pearl and the gold stud, which should have just been glued together.
Drop of was not a problem at all and prices for repair were fair.
I picked up my pieces a few days later and went home, on closer inspection at home I realized my earring was turning black and the pearl part did not match my other earring. I went into the store to talk to Stacy who was adamant that it's the correct earring even though it did not resemble the matching earring at all she even confirmed that the earring she gave me did not have a gold stud but a plain metal one. After some arguing she told me to leave the earring and she would fix it..a few days later I went to get my earring and indeed the stud part had been replaced with a gold one that looked the same as the one I originally gave her.
The pearl is still not the same but because they are a small business there is no one else I could go to. In my effort to help small business in our area I was deceived and now I am out of my beloved earrings. So if you wish to drop anything off at this small business I would take lots of pictures and maybe have her sign the pictures so you know you are getting the same item back.",2021-01-02 13:28:22,313,1468,

The first thing that caught my attention was the small parking lot accompanying a pretty large restaurant space. In fact, when I pulled it, it was hard to maneuver because a takeout customer in a large SUV parked right in front of the entrance, making it very challenging for me, in a midsize sedan, to go around it and find parking.

After carefully getting through, I entered the restaurant and there was a bottleneck as you check in. The restaurant itself is spacious, but the entrance way is too small. They really need to broaden the lobby area.

As I was picking up a takeout order, my stay there wasn't very long. I grabbed my food and we had a nice dinner at home. I ordered two fried fish kid's meals for my kids. Good value and one of my sons couldn't finish all of the fish. For my wife and me, we ordered the du Jour Catch Special for $49. It came with either 1 lb. of snow crab legs, 1 lb. of Dungeness, or 2 lobster tails (6 oz. each), plus two choices of mussels, clams, shrimp (head off for $3 extra), and a couple of other options. We opted for lobster tail, clams, and shrimp (head off). The special also comes with three pieces of corn and 3 potatoes. We got it wit the garlic butter-mild, with a side of the hot sauce (which wasn't very hot).

They're new, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. My wife said her lobster tail was properly cooked. Mine was overcooked. The shrimp and clams were properly prepared. I would have liked it a little spicier, but I don't know the combinations of sauces and spice levels I'd need to get it just right. For $52 (we got the shrimp with the heads off), it was a decent amount of food for two, but not quite enough.

I arrived at the dealer at the time of the appointment where they had me stand around for about 15 mins before a salesman was assigned to help me. The salesman's name was PJ. When my wife and I sat down it was very apparent that he had no concern for the current pandemic since he would not wear a mask over his mouth or nose. 
Since the truck that I had previously viewed on the website had sold, he had me test drive a similar truck.  The truck was nice so I came back to see if I could make a deal. 
 When i came back i asked PJ to find out what they would offer me for my trade in. He became visibly irritated that i had even asked. After a little bit of whining he started to do the trade assessment. When he came back they had offered me far below KBB for my trade so I said it was going to take more for my trade to make a deal. He came back offered me a little more that still was not enough for me to feel comfortable. When he left to talk to the manager the third time PJ said under his breath that 'I was $#@%ing waisting his time'. 
 The manager came out with PJ this time and by now I was pretty upset at the salesman's unprofessionalism and really did not feel like dealing with them. While I was talking to the manager PJ still was not wearing his mask correctly until I brought it to the managers attention. All the manager wanted to do was tell me that they are the best dealership around and how great they are. I had been to about 5 dealers this week alone and this was the most unprofessional and worst ran one that I had been to. I let the manager know i didn't appreciate the way the salesman had spoken to me and that I wanted the keys to my truck to leave. 
 I ended up purchasing from another dealer in the area, who gave me $4,000 more than Jim Butler had offered for my trade. I would not recommend the Jim Butler dealership in Fenton to anyone due to the unprofessionalism of the people that they have working their sales floor.",2021-01-06 01:11:12,446,2078,

First and foremost, let me make this abundantly clear...EVERYTHING on the menu...is absolutely...
FIRE!!!
 !!!
Solid 5/5!!!

Being a NYC and LA Koreatown regular, I've had my fair share of KBBQ and Matjoa, can easily rival any of the restaurants blow for blow on the food. 

HOWEVER...the service (minus my guy Joe of course, who is evidently the standard bearer) needs a lot of work.
1. You've got one guy who does the mask over the mouth...but not over the nose thing in the midst of a whole pandemic.
2. The other ""non-Joe"" guy who brought us the wrong order...pork belly instead of marinated pork.
3. I asked both of these two gentlemen, at separate times for more of the bean paste and they both forgot....

Ohhhhh but NOT my boy Joe...when I finally asked him, he came back in seconds with not only bean paste, but TWO other accompanying sauces which he believed would pair well with the meats we currently had on the grill...

I'd absolutely come back for another meal, but I'd probably opt to solely have Joe interact with the table. 

Side Note to Management: Outside of what I've listed above, it's clear to me that every 'non-Joe' staff member's head is in the right place. They all KNEW they should be attentive, they checked in as one SHOULD, they did what each individually believed one SHOULD do when providing great service. But it seemed like it was more of a theoretical exercise than one where your heart is in the right place. Gaps on follow through or going the extra mile to curate an experience like Joe did... matters. 

I honestly wouldn't be surprised if Joe was actually the manager, because the level of care and detail he showed versus everyone else was notable.",2021-01-03 03:32:28,391,1809,
GhfQcRNQII_762LDa-gAGQ,TDQuFUn2r9_AWnzTj-Mh8Q,9kJrHMl-tbHLHmIaNLUXrg,5,18,2,10,"Been here for dinner twice with my boyfriend. Once in September and another thanksgiving weekend. Very  Impressed especially since it is a newly opened restaurant . I believe it opened August 2020, a month after COVID reopenings. Has a large covered  outdoors picnic style lunch benches area attached to restaurant.  There are also several side walk tables . The bar area is small and very limited indoor seating. They do not take reservations last I went in November.  The first time we went , put our names down on the waiting list and about 45 mins to 1 hr wait on a Saturday around 7:30.  

DRINKS:
 A big fan of their margarita cocktails, ""mezcalita"" and the seasonal cranberry one we had over Thanksgiving weekend. I don't like mezcal but you can sub tequila same price.  Their ""mezcalita"" is essentially a  mezcal spicy margarita - fresh lime, agave , fresh pineapple, jalapeño,  cilantro, tajin (10 dollars). I tried the "" jungle cat""  because I saw a lot of people ordering it and loving it. It was well made but too sweet for me. I like cocktails more on the tart or sour side.  Our server no problem subbed it out for another mezcalita when I expressed I didn't like the sweetness. 

STARTERS:
So sad they no longer had street corn on the menu when we visited in November. Corn, a summer vegetable, so that's probably why it was no longer offered because there is nooo way that was not a  crowd favorite.  My boyfriend and I looove street corn and this was done just the way we love it--1. on the cobb, 2. charrrred, 3. Lots of mayo/ aoili  and cotija cheese!   Being that it's fall, crispy brussels probably took its place. Brussels  were really good because they were charrrred and  all crispy.  We almost always order the  brussels if it's on a menu. Nice to see a  crispy brussels dish without the the usual cheese and  cripy bacon/ pork toppings. I loved the acidity of the accoutrements of jicama, pickle red onions , apple and touch of sweetness with the agave. Fritto misto (15 dollars)- aka fried vegetables and shrimp. What a smart way to get someone to eat their vegetables! Fried avocado yum! But  as a starter for two for us , just a little heavy since we planned on getting another starter along  with our own mains.  2nd  visit  we ordered the Jerk octopus and it didn't come til after we mentioned to  our server we were still waiting for it. It came out  after  the Brussels and we were  staring our entrees . We could tell it was rushed/ forgotten. The jerk seasoning gave it a lot of flavor but it was a little fishy and not crispy enough. What looks like char in the pictures is  the jerk marinade.  This is the third time we attempted to order octopus at a restaurant  and made us realized maybe octopus is not for us.
 
MAINS:
Our two mains we both loved were whole fried snapper fish and the snapper a la plancha filet with saffron rice. The whole snapper fish fried to perfection without being greasy.  Had it back in September when they made it with charred corn. Has some different accompaniments now.  Love the portion size of the fish in both dishes. The 2nd time  we went the snapper a la plancha dish was  somewhat different . I added both pictures below. There was no ginger scallion sauce, which after trying it the 2nd time without sauce, we unanimously agreed it  was what made the dish wow!   We loved the first version much better, although this version is also good, a sauce is needed since everything is so ""dry"" -not in a bad way dry. It's just that crispy skin fish, fried rice with chorizo needs some more moisture than  the drops of  romesco verde sauce can give to these components. This time it also had no mint, or summer squash. Our sever explained that they used seasonal ingredients and the menu items sometimes will have variations based on season for sourcing ingredients. Which I can appreciate.  I was just so excited from the first time we got it I didn't even bother reading description to notice it had changed. One kink I usually find with newly opened restaurants is customer service. But Wild Child both occasions  exceeds my customer service expectations. Because I expressed that the dish was different than last time I ordered and didn't realize it was different this time around, my server offered us a complimentary desert.  On our November visit I tried the pan seared  scallop (32 dollars) which was an asian flavor profile. We both loved it, because we tend to also order seared  scallops often and we can't recall having it with Asian flavors.  This version had bok choy, roasted Japanese sweet potatoes, oyster mushrooms, pickled shiitake relish, sweet potatoe apple purree. Scallops were big and juicy,  browned and seared to perfection.

All in all I'm excited to come back and I have been raving about it since my first visit. Two amazing dining experiences solidifies this  as a 5 star restaurant for me!",2021-01-15 03:41:29,973,4887,

Living only 3 blocks away, I was cautious about getting too excited until we had tried it. We were seated at about 5:30 on a Saturday evening and we were the only people there - the place filled up however so that when we left there was only one vacant table inside. Very simple decor, welcoming  and warm with ample-sized tables. 
We ordered a tricolore salad, calamari appetizer and a chopped salad.  
For mains we ordered a Cioppino, an Amatriciana, and a Gnocchi FraDiavola. Bread was delivered soon after we sat - it was delightful and perfect. Tuscan style and baked in-house. The 3 appetizers did not disappoint, being tasty extremely fresh and all made-from-scratch.
The Cioppino is a classical style, and was served piping hot and slightly spicy. Just simple and quite outstanding. The FraDiavola was totally flavorful with more than a touch of heat and perfectly cooked shrimp. The gnocchi is a unusual style and shape but equally tasty and tender. My dish was the Amatriciana and was done in a different style to that from Amatrice in Lazio, where the guanciale is simply sauted into the sauce, at Matteo it tastes and feels like it is crispy-fried and then included in the sauce. This gave a light crunchiness and was superb.
We are all 3 critical foodies, and also in the business world and so have an understanding of the challenges that a new restaurant faces - this place should have no problem succeeding! I can't wait to come back for some pizza and caprese!

...edit. We ordered in some pizza last night. Oy! all the pizza places in Tampa Bay - beware. So incredibly good. We had a Regina Margherita and a Burrata.

If you live nearby and will be visiting more than once a year, I highly recommend becoming a member. With my family membership, my husband and I have two passes and can each bring someone in with us for free under that pass -- usually my daughter and a friend of her choice. With membership, you can come as often as you like, get a leg up on events that require a ticket (before the pandemic, they always had wonderful music performances and at night, there are fountain shows!), and get discounts on things like food and gift shop items. 

And you'll definitely want to grab a bite to eat while you're here because the food is phenomenal. We don't see quite the same variety during COVID, but the outdoor eateries near the Conservatory have some of my favorites -- Kennett square mushroom soup, ribeye cheesesteak (or there's a vegan Impossible option), super gooey Mac and cheese, and much more. The couple times we've stopped in to see the lights over the Christmas holiday, my daughter has loved their hot chocolate and mini cinnamon/sugar dusted donuts, which come in a bag of about 8. They're not overly sweet, but the hot chocolate is. so they balance each other out. 

There is a ton of outdoor tables and seating, and for the winter, they've added several heated tents. All the tables are appropriately spaced, and even though people are respectfully distanced in line, if you don't want to stand where everyone else is, you can use the QR code at each table to place an order that will delivered to you. 

And did I mention the beer? Local favorites like Victory and Dogfish are pretty standard, but they've also started including other craft breweries, like Levante into the mix. They also brew Starbucks coffee, have a mix of sodas, and Bubly carbonated water options for the sugar/carb conscious. 

But the REAL reason you're here is for the gardens, right? Here are some highlights you shouldn't miss, and I've tried to include details for parents with little ones. 

CONSERVATORY -- changes with the seasons and is beautiful no matter the time of year. This is where you'll access specialty displays, too, such as the Orchid room, rose house, ""silver"" garden (cacti), and the Gardens' impressive bonsai collection. There's also an indoor children's garden where kids can run around a maze, ""paint"" the walls with water, and even ""fish"" in the fountains.

THE MEADOW & PIERCE'S WOODS -- if you're looking for a quieter place to walk, there are fewer people and more wide open walking paths in the Meadow. Tall grasses, wildflowers, and even some wooded trails are available. Summer in the meadow is amazing, and they've added covered benches and seating if you need a break from the heat and sun. The Meadow Garden has a raised wooden walkway where you can spot birds and enjoy the shade from the trees. The walkways are all wide and easy to navigate with strollers or wheelchairs, but the bathroom/changing room options are farther apart (and the bathrooms have fewer stalls), so if you have little ones, or just a small bladder, plan accordingly. 

CHILDREN'S CORNER -- the outdoor children's garden area is just as much fun as the indoor, but much, much more spacious! We used to have picnics among the strawberry bushes and my daughter loved trying to identify all the greens and herbs that are growing here. There's a large play area, with interactive and informational boards about bees and farming, and some musical instruments for little ones to experiment with.

THE FOUNTAIN GARDEN & GROTTO -- during the summer nights, Longwood puts on BEAUTIFULLY choreographed fountain/music shows. Bring a picnic blanket and/or chairs to sit and enjoy from start to finish. There are nearby restrooms/changing stations in the building between the fountains and the conservatory. During the Christmas Lights display, there is a giant fire pit that the staff keep lit so it's nice and warm. 

WILDLIFE TREE & TREEHOUSE -- near the small & large lakes, you'll see these two beautiful wooded wonders. The treehouse is not only a treat for little ones, but a wonder for grown ups as well! I've seen a few Christmas time proposals at both of these spots and along the lake, it's just very beautiful scenery. 

The staff are following COVID protocols and I'm happy to say so are the guests, with very few exceptions that I've seen. Masks are required for entry, indoors, and while not seated for dinning. There are social distancing signs and circles on the walkways and at the ordering booths to remind people to space apart. If you're waiting for the rest of your party to arrive before entering, they will not let you stand inside the visitors center -- they keep the crowds moving, so have your scannable tickets ready and enjoy!",2021-01-10 16:27:11,993,4946,

Immediately they brought over some tasty chips, salsa, and bean dip. The chips and bean dip were delicious! I asked to sample the chili Verde sauce, and so they brought out a salsa bowl with some verde juice. I was thankful they did because that's what I ordered. It was yummy and took me back to my California roots, where authentic Mexican food is everywhere. My husband had the Enchilada Sauza, a bit tangy, but that's due to the tomatillos. He said it was still good and kept saying how we will be coming back. My daughter LOVED her fajitas; even my husband said they were the best in Reno. Again, the portion sizes were enough to fill us up and have some to take home. The waiters always kept our drinks refilled and came back to follow up many times. We also ordered margaritas, and those were delicious. I would recommend Casa Grande; we are going back tonight! They are a bit pricey, I didn't see the tab, but our bill was around $120. However, we did have three dinner plates, a side chimichanga, four margaritas, and four shots. So overall it wasn't too bad. I'm already craving Casa Grande; I can't wait until dinner time.",2021-01-15 19:40:26,310,1422,

(So remember that as you consider this review.) And I did not eat in the Cafe, so this review does NOT cover it. *Previous reviews of this grocery do cover the cafe.

Why 4 stars & not five? I almost laughed after reading the sign near checkout that stated there are NO RETURNS OF ANY KIND due to Covid. What? Seriously, that makes zero sense, but it is awfully convenient & profitable for the company. Also, the floors weren't the cleanest (ex. dry food items spilled in aisles & no one performing a clean up), & there were too many stock boxes lying around because shelves were being stocked during business hours-- although the boxes were at times lying empty in aisles not currently being stocked.

To this Indian grocery novice, prices appeared VERY GOOD!  A BIG KUDOS goes out to stocker ""Reddy,"" who took at least 10 min to show me what spices I'll need in order to cook most Indian dishes, where to find them, & how to use them. Truly an EXCELLENT representative of this Indian grocery! Thanks to him, I bought much more than I had originally intended, & I'm more likely to return. (I only went in to browse after shopping next door & spotting this market.)

Located in Market Square in Tampa Palms beside Petsmart, this grocery is open daily from 10 AM till 9 PM; however, the Cafe is closed on Mondays. Its hours are 11:30 AM till 9 PM Tuesday thru Sunday. 

In this market,  you'll find fresh fruits & vegetables; halal meat; bakery items made on site; buriyani; appetizers; frozen foods; grocery items; many grains, spices (SO many) & sauces; & just about anything an Indian family might want from a grocery store...including lots & lots of rices & incense:) 

This is a decent-sized grocery that has wide aisles & a high ceiling. It reminded me of a small Costco or Sam's Club. There was a nice selection of fresh produce too well hidden in the back behind tall freezer cases (where you'll find the frozen Naan/Nan). The cold section is to the far right. The Cafe with tables & a large TV is located on the far left (see pic). Each aisle in this store is marked w/ an overhead sign; the food items appear to be decently organized. 

Check out is easy. There are two old registers behind plexiglass; however, the registers appear rather new... & quite nice-- each grocery item rung up by the cashier appears in bold print on the screen so customers can easily see how much they're being charged. (See pic.) Your items will be bagged in small yellow plastic bags. 

Thank you, Taaza Mart management, for a good variety of food items, for the great prices, & for ""Reddy""! I shall return...& return to tell ""Reddy"" how my Chicken Korma & other homemade Indian dishes fared!",2021-01-09 01:55:03,613,2823,

Was told ""See Avi"" at Wesley Chapel Target for better deal with better service....with Total Wireless; uses Verizon towers.And Consumer Cellular uses T Mobile and AT&T SIM cards which evidently are constantly failing and being replaced for additional cost! Because Sprint and T Mobile have horrible cell reception in my neighborhood and my house.....I was relieved that Verizon towers delivered! Or maybe it was new better Samsung Galaxy?
Even got a few rebates; bought two phones and initiated two cell cards. Was ""sold"" Unlimited data--4G for 1st gig....then 2G---which fit fine since only data I use is google Voice and Directions.
However, I used my fast data, and instead of slower reception....I have NO DATA CONNECTION! Total Wireless customer care idiots (overseas) say this ""service"" is not as ""reliable""....and my smart phone is too new and smart to recognize older 2G systems! Honestly!
My phone works with 2G, 3G, and 4G...not reliable REALLY is NON EXISTENT!
So the plan should be represented and sold as 1G of faster data only!
Target and Marketsource (tech company) need to be crystal clear about FACTS!
The price is okay; the cell reception very good; that's it!
Have had to make 4 or 5 trips back to Target for set-up and service issues. And today Avi texted back he isn't a personal consultatant; any future dealings to be Total Wireless techs. Seems ""Target customer service"" stops after purchase!
And I mailed one phone to pacific northwest to a family semi-disabled member....out there, there are NO TARGET TECHS! They refer customers to Walmart!

I have worked with Edwin Watson for almost 2 1/2 years on the property management side.  I was very careful to interview a Property Manager that not only does what he says he's going to do - but one that takes ownership in your problem.  Edwin was God sent. 
I came from a very very bad Property management company in the Indianapolis area - who was simply terrible.  Because of those bad actors -  I had received several fines and penalties on my 2 duplexes.   I decided to go with and hire Triple E because Edwin was confident he could turn my properties around.  Which he did!!!   I hired Edwin late on a Friday night and he was at my property that very next working day.   Edwin is efficient, takes really good notes, is personable and works on obtaining the best affordable  price for any and all repairs.   This year I hired his company to sell both my properties and both escrows went very smoothly!  I come from the Title and Escrow world (40 plus years) and I know who is good and who is bad - as far as a realtor.  Edwin is not good - but is great.  I also want to give a shout out to his assistant Veronica - who always had great follow through and communication.  As far as real estate investing, I'm out of the Indy area for now - but if I go back, it's Edwin Watson and Triple E Realty and Property Management hands down!!!!",2021-01-29 01:12:56,303,1442,
U3CiQfD8TI7DdCqM53IOUQ,3QJZG1iIbfdJ4volePZfVg,_IpIAl-QagCo5PyAMeZ8sA,1,1,0,0,"I went to clearwater rooms to go and found a sofa (really a sectional with left and right recliners). for the price with power.  I got the price but had just started to look, so I left and tried a few more stores. I decided on the rooms to go one and returned about an hour later (several stores in a row, so it makes for quick shopping), talked to the same salesperson, confirmed the price again, and made sure they were power. The display was not power, and we make sure we specified power several times, even commenting that we already had power one at home and loved it. 
There are no prices except an 8/10 sheet of paper with 50 items, so you are relying on the salesperson for information.  
Also, on the invoice, nowhere does it say no power or power, something I pointed out at the time of sale and was reassured for the 3rd time that it was power. The salesgirl was new but had a supervisor with her when I was checking out. The supervisor sat down in a chair nearby to watch and could hear all our conversation. He never said to us that he was an employee, and anyone would have thought he was a stalker until she asked him a question.

So, the sofa is delivered, and we notice that only one side is power. I called to say there was a mistake, and they said, ""oh no, those were both supposed to be non-power."" I explained the situation as above and asked them to talk to the salesperson. Their response was she was off today and said I could get a refund, but I would still be charged the delivery charge (99.00), and they could not pick it up for a month. That when they did pick it up, they would have to look for any damages or wear. Or we could buy a power one at an additional cost of 400.00 - 200.00 for the new one and 200.00 for the one we got plus delivery.  

So, at this point, my options were to refund and lose money for their mistake and trust (after they played the bait and switch already) that they would pick them up and not say there was damage so I could get a refund. Or pay 400.00 additional dollars plus 99.00 delivery to get the correct items I was told I was getting when I made the purchase. 

I called the customer service number but was told there was nothing they could do that you have to deal with the store. I called the store and asked for a manager to be told no manager was working that day. I asked for a return call to see if they had talked to the salesperson but never got a return call. 

I get those things to happen, and people make mistakes, but when I tried to correct it, the store acted like we stole their furniture ""you should've got the power option."" My advice to you is to stay clear of this store and Rooms to Go. But if you do need to shop there, make sure what you are told is spelled out in the receipt since they will scam you if you do not.",2021-01-28 12:37:54,614,2807,

After countless times of saying I won't be back, I decided to give it one last try due to it being my local breakfast spot. After waiting 25 minutes for food, the waitress walked up and asked if we were ready to checkout thinking we already got our food and finished it. 

I had to send back my eggs for being undercooked, as well as the bacon. I will say the pancake I got was one of the better things I've gotten from there. Another server had to come help our server get our refills as well as get the food that needed to be sent back. The bus boy held his hands out to us to give him our plates when we were done eating instead of just picking them up off the table. 

When it was time to checkout the server went back and forth at least 4 times trying to get the checks right and couldn't seem to do it. We had split checks, one of the checks was $19 and some change. We gave her two $20 bills so she could make change and get tipped. She brought back change and the same $20 we gave. We paid for one bill on a credit card that has plenty enough money to pay the bill on it. On our way out she chased us down and said there was still a $4 balance that needed to be paid and said our card didn't cover our meal which was clearly a mistake on her part after all the trouble of spitting checks. 

We left and made a phone call to the store to speak to a manager. The manager insisted it was our fault and our card was the problem and said ""it's best you just don't come back, we expect this from people like you"". And hung up on us.

I'm absolutely disgusted at the way this was handled as well as the entire meal. I will never go back to Caffe Blah Blah Blah because that's exactly what it is....BLAH. 

I'd recommend trying YaYa's or even an awful McDonalds Sausage Burrito because you surely will have a better experience than walking into this unsatisfying disrespectful restaurant.",2021-01-24 19:50:18,422,1944,

I love the Bown crossing location. The staff here is super friendly and always gets my order right.  I like this location best because it's peaceful and calming.  

We got the croquettes for an appetizer.  It's served with tomato basil soup.  Delicious.  We normally get the fondue which is to die for, but opted to try something new today. 

We both ordered the French onion soup and holy moly was this amazing.  Normally I order the apple chick walnut salad but I thought the dinner portion was too much for me to eat tonight so I opted for soup.  Either way though, that salad or this soup option you can't go wrong.  Ps the dressing on the apple chicken walnut salad is amazing too!!!

For dinner my hubby got the roasted chicken pizza and I got the portobello mushroom pizza with a ranch dipping sauce.  It's my favorite!!!! If you come for lunch, the pick two is the perfect size, if you come for dinner, they don't have combos so plan to leave with leftovers. Dinner portions are huge! 

Dessert was a hit cookie in cast iron with vanilla ice cream.  Dangerous! It's ooey and gooey and sinfully delicious.   Splurge fir a birthday or date night!  It's pretty good.  Otherwise get one hot chocolate chip cookie on its own and that'll fix your sweet tooth! 

Overall what I really love the most about this location is just it's calming by the mountains,  it's peaceful, I love sitting outside in the summertime I love the coziness of sitting inside in the winter time.

Poor quality sushi and missing items from my order were some of the highlights of my expensive mistake with Airyara and Postmates. 

After a one hour and twenty minute delivery time, I discovered that my order was missing items. I phoned Airyara and spoke to a nice lady named ""Cindy"".  Rather than face another hour plus wait, I requested a refund for the undelivered items. She informed me that because I ordered online and had Postmates deliver, she could not refund my money, so she would have to call Postmates ""when they weren't busy"". Not the best customer service, but ok, I understand.  She then informed me she would get back to me later in the evening with a resolution.  Well, here we are 24 hours later, they are not open today and I have not heard anything back.  

With the prices on the sushi I was expecting a certain level of quality and I was completely dissatisfied (aka a $15 Snake Roll with no eel sauce on it).  My buddy who ate with me also remarked on the poor quality.

With an unacceptable delivery time, missing items, poor quality product and 30% taxes and fees (not to mention a tip), the next time I want sushi, I will drive across town to Sonobana rather than do business with Airyara and Postmates ever again.

We were having such a good time that our tab was $160 before we tipped the waitress. Apparently we had been there for hours. We were never told there was a seating limit of two hours. We were still spending money after the two hour limit and no one ever said anything. Literally hours later out waitress was told by whoever this guy was that she had to close our tab. We had just refilled our hookah and another friend came. He bought a drink from the bar. We're still smoking the hookah that we just paid for a refill and I'm guessing he's a manager. He comes to the table and tells us we have to get up because we've been there too long. Remind you we purchased about 6-8 top shelf drinks, 3 appetizers, a hookah, and hookah refill. We've spent money the entire time we sat at the table, but it was the way he spoke to us to tell us we had to get up. It was understood that they were getting busy. The approach was the problem. After we began to speak to the waitresses and the owner about it, we were then told we could continue to sit if we opened a new tab. MAKE IT MAKE SENSE!

The snow dome was fun and they have a bunny slope for little ones! I'll post a vid my two younger ones enjoyed it for some fun and made snow balls like everyone else they were flying all over  

The snow is ice if you haven't been up north it's wet dirty and slippery but they're doing what they can and I can't complain about that, it's dirt tons of people and Florida. Very similar to when we would go ski in NC and it wasn't snowing they made snow the same way as here. 


If you go and don't sled they still make you pay. I think they need to take into consideration that Bc I would pay for the big kids to go if I could sit and supervise but that's not an option unfortunately.

I've head La Bahia bookmarked for a while and finally found the opportunity to swing by. I was grateful I walked in when I did, because about two minutes later, the line went from one person to 20 on a Sunday afternoon. Apparently they have already built up quite the following!

I anguished over what to order because literally everything on the menu looked great. I eventually opted for the Cuban sandwich and was incredibly happy with my decision.

I've eaten a lot of Cuban sandwiches in Tampa Bay. It's honestly very hard to officially declare a favorite. But I definitely can't think of one that was *obviously* more enjoyable than this one. It consisted of mojo pork and sliced ham, both of which were perfect. There also seemed to be more cheese on this sandwich than your typical Cuban, and it was incredibly melted - two things I will never be upset about: cheese and melted cheese. I also opted for mayo instead of mustard, because, obviously no one would ever eat mustard on purpose.

I attempted to order a side of mofongo, but I was told that they didn't have any. That ended up being totally okay because I ordered yellow rice and black beans instead, which was also amazing. 

The only thing I wish I would have done differently was choose a different dessert. Everything was on full display inside the glass case of happiness and it all looked like something I wanted to swim in. I made a quick decision to go with a quesito, as recommended by the cashier. It was fine, but I think I would have preferred one of the other 30 tasty choices.

Update: tried this place again for take out to avoid the terrible delivery service.  Pizza was great.  Antipasto was pathetic.  One single piece of prosciutto, some cheese and fruit on lettuce? This would hardly constitute an antipasto platter at any other Italian restaurant I've ever been to.  Veal saltimbocca was not served with pasta-instead came with a salad and a very small amount of sautéed spinach.

We have been driving by seeing their sign for 50% off Mondays for weeks and finally remembered we wanted to try it out on MLK day. The host first tried to sit us at a table that was a foot away from another couple, while other booths were available but just needed to be cleaned. We waited for the bigger booth to be cleaned so we weren't sitting on top of the other couple. This is a small restaurant so most of the tables can't be spaced out. If dining during covid freaks you out, this isn't the place for you.

I was pumped to tell everyone about their awesome 50% off special on Mondays, come to find out (after sitting for 10 minutes with no one greeting us), it's not offered on holidays.. so we went on the wrong day. The server said ""oh the host didn't tell you?"" Which would have been appreciated prior to sitting down. 

The service was definitely lacking for us. We waited several minutes to be greeted, had empty drinks multiple times and our server never checked back after dropping off our food until we were done.

For the food: some was good, some not so much. 

Pros: We had the burrata appetizer and thought that was the highlight of our meal. The burrata wasn't as liquidy and fresh as it normally is at other restaurants but was still good. The limone chicken had good flavor, but the chicken breasts itself were tiny.

Cons: the gnocchi bolognese was not good. For a place with homemade gnocchi, I'd expect those little pillows of heaven to taste amazing but they were actually quite bland. The sauce that was supposed to be a bolognese sauce tasted like a traditional Ragu meat sauce. This dish wasn't satisfying and they missed the mark on the bolognese sauce.

And in true St. Louis fashion, I KNEW review 100 had to be about the the symbol of our city.

There's a joke going around social media right now that says no one who lives in St. Louis can drive past the Arch without saying ""Look there it is!"" And it's so true. This iconic monument truly is a spectacular part of our city's identity. 

But the Arch really is so much more than just a beautiful centerpiece. Since moving to St. Louis, the national park that the Arch sits upon has provided me with so many magical moments and memories that will last a lifetime. 

When my boyfriend first adopted our dog, Clyde, we lived downtown and used the park everyday for his walks. My camera roll on my phone is full of photos of him at the Arch in various lighting situations. So it served as a training ground for Clyde to learn how to pose for photos and become the social media rockstar he is today! But more than just providing the perfect place for photos, the grassy hills and wide open spaces gave us a place to go during warmy, sunny summers to just sit and enjoy the weather without the fear of being catching the virus. 

But I will also remember the exact opposite of that, when thousands upon thousands of St. Louis Blues fans crammed in shoulder to shoulder to celebrate winning the Stanley Cup. Under the Arch. The setting was the perfect exclamation point to the Blues' season, and could not think of a better place to hold such an event. It was St. Louis' history being made in the most St. Louis way. Plus I got to meet Jon Hamm!

Sunrise. Sunset. Or anytime in between. Take a walk. Take a run. Or just sit and take in a little bite of beauty. We are so lucky to have the Gateway Arch National Park.",2021-01-05 21:22:29,401,1904,

The food tasted like something your 3rd favorite aunt created, but it looks great - points for that.  The more egregious issue is the service... wow it stunk.  This was not a pleasurable experience.  

The person who seemed to be in charge was very reluctant to help, she gave off a very ""ugh, why are YOU here?!?"" vibe, which is always a delight to deal with.  I made a special trip due to the positive reviews here, (must have been friends and family) otherwise I would not have stuck around. That was a mistake.  When she did eventually pull herself from ""waiting for us to leave"", she was impolite, unwelcoming, and surly -  probably the most positive words I can use to round out  the demeanor.  I get it, it is clearly a townie shop made for her pals, but ideally one would feign ""normal human interaction"". 

There was a younger woman who actually got the food - she was friendly, polite, and professional.  She needs a raise and promotion for being the one person with some customer service skills and for having to deal with previously mentioned person all day.  It must feel like 5 Mondays a week...

It is the perfect shop to visit if you are the kind of person who refuses to stop speaking on a cell phone to make eye contact with the cashier. If being sold ""meh"" pastry from your least favorite prison guard is on your bucket list, this is the spot.

We finally reconnected with Dr. Lisa tonight who subsequently banned us from her practice (as if we'd ever allow her near any of our dogs again) because we ""yelled"" at her after she rudely tried to over talk both of us (on a 3-way call) by repeating that she had given us proper post treatment instructions for our fur baby.  Not only did she not give us proper post treatment instructions which we only found out from speaking with her colleague yesterday; she didn't even bother to inform us that if the treatment didn't work, we should consider the daily treatment instead.
Here are our very valid grievances:
1. For this particular incident, every time we spoke with an HP rep, we asked them to call back the secondary # on file (even confirming it with them before hanging up) because we co-parent. Every single time, they called the primary#.
2. In Lisa's banning email, she even got the day she treated our fur baby incorrect. In her email to me, she states, she saw my Frenchie on 1/15/21 when in fact she saw him on Tues, 1/12/21. 1/15 was the day we called back to alert them that the treatment didn't seem to be working. (See screenshot of correspondences). But clearly, WE have the communication problem. #sarcasm
3. She thought WE should pay for a daily treatment because WE chose the one-time treatment which was ineffective and somehow OUR fault. When we protested, she repeated herself over and over again.
4. As I stated in my response to her ""banning"" email...
In her own words,  ""He even repeated that you wouldn't have to do anything and I said nope we just put it in and let it work, you wont have to do anything else"" IS NOT THE SAME AS COMMUNICATING ""if you see him pawing at his ear again or any discharge,  don't be alarmed,  the medication is working and this normal,  do not attempt to clean it out"" which is exactly what one of your colleagues mentioned to us on the phone yesterday at which time we both stated,  we weren't made aware of that during the initial appointment. That is both effective and specific communication which is pivotal in giving directions post medical treatments.
5. This was the 3rd negative incident at this practice within a year:
A. Waiting over an 1 hr and 45 mins to be seen for a scheduled appointment in early 2020, to the extent, the designated vet had to call and apologize and issue a credit for our next service. Thankfully she provided all his records and you can see in their own notes that this is true. (See screenshots of their own notes on the records)
2. Attempting to double charge us for my dog Phrees emergency follow up after his balls weren't shrinking in the time recommended per the very specific information provided post surgery after his neutering services and had to be rechecked 3x. (Text correspondence provided) 

Grateful, Lisa is only a Vet. If she were a medical Dr. or Pediatrician talking, dismissing &  engaging concerned parents that way, that would be even more disconcerting. Corporate culture comes from the head & it all makes complete sense as to the apathy and negligence we've experienced at HousePaws over the past year. Glad to be ex clients. It seems the communication issue (whether failing to communicate why there's a long wait time, calling the non-preferred# 3x, no post treatment communication and not even knowing what day you actually saw us) lies with this practice.",2021-01-18 02:14:44,825,4043,

My issue is with their relentless push for monthly membership $$$ .  I have asthma and my pulmonologist has told me not to take any unnecessary risks as there is significant risk to me if I get COVID.    I explained this to ME many months ago and they agreed to freeze my membership.     Recently I started getting texts and calls indicating they are unable to process this month's membership and my membership would be cancelled if this was not addressed.   We are still in a pandemic and  I already have 14-16 hours of accrued services I have not gone in for due to crazy work schedule prior to COVID then COVID concerns.    

   Yesterday I spoke live with Aliana and explained the situation again.  She said they had to process 3 months of payments in order to enable my account to be frozen again.   I explained this doesn't work for me and I was transferred to another person whom I can't recall her name.  I was then told they had to process at least one payment to freeze my account-  again-  I said this doesn't work - why can't you just freeze the account as it was.      They still wanted another payment-   so I cancelled membership. (and must forfeit accrued services)

In the end, this is about ""subscriber fatigue"" more than anything else-   I'm done signing up for ""monthly plans"" for services I don't absolutely need on a regular predictable schedule.",2021-01-29 17:57:06,301,1554,

Dad's Kitchen offers a variety of flavors, dishes, and types of meals. Peruvian in its roots, DK's main speciality appears to be traditional American breakfast. This is highlighted by the quantity of items on the menu and the bulk of its social media posts pertaining to the first meal of the day. However as I mentioned above, there's more than what meets the eye. The menu also has sandwiches, burgers, Mexican tacos, quesadillas, and Peruvian dishes. Picking up dinner there also presented me with an array of yummy looking dessert goods as well. 

My experience with Dad's was a good one. I enjoyed talking to the owner while paying. The site is tastefully decorated and very clean. Most importantly, the food was tasty too. My wife and I had the fish tacos and the lomo saltado. The former of which was great! The latter was good, but not mind blowing. True to its name the saltado was a little salty but flavorful nonetheless. I think in the future, I would swap out the fries for something else, for I'm not sure how it complements the rice and meat. 

Overall, Dad's Kitchen is a great addition to the Broad Ripple neighborhood because it fits the mold of being family owned & offering unique specialities. It may be trying to put its eggs in one too many baskets, but it's new, it's the pandemic, and I think restaurant owners right now are doing what it takes to draw in as many customers as possible. I know personally I'll continue supporting this restaurant, and I look forward to witnessing how it it'll grow and evolve in the future.",2021-01-23 15:06:39,364,1768,

I'll start with the positives - The location is excellent. You can walk, bike, scooter, etc. anywhere downtown and access to the canal is incredible. The apartments are large with sizeable closet space and bathrooms. It's nice to have access to a pool in the summer (even though they never seemed to open it on time).

HOWEVER, management is awful. Truly horrendous. Over the course of our time there, we experienced SEVERAL leaking issues. Once, rain water seeped into our apartment near the fireplace, staining the carpet. Another time, the water heater broke and leaked - again staining the carpet when it was dragged out. Worst of all, there were TWO separate occasions when maintenance people working in the apartment above us caused major leaks from the ceiling into our apartment, ruining clothing items and irreplaceable family photos.

When the latter occurred, management promised us a $100 Target gift card to make amends. We never received it. 

When our final lease was up for renewal, we went to sign the paperwork and we were told we either needed to leave or upgrade to a two-bedroom apartment because we had had a baby. After doing some legal research, we learned that this was ILLEGAL on their behalf because our child was six months old and the square footage of the apartment was sufficient. When I confronted them about this, they allowed us to extend our lease another six months in the one-bedroom apartment.

After that incident, we decided to leave. However, when we moved out, we did not get our security deposit back (despite leaving the apartment in good condition for having lived there for SIX years). Instead, we received a bill for $4.86. The reason? Carpet replacement and ""other."" 

We called for an explanation, but never got a call back from the property manager like we were promised. Frustrated that we were being charged for carpet replacement after six years of living there (isn't that standard when new tenants move in?), we decided not to pay the $4.86 while we waited for the return call from the property manager. We never got the call and instead, they sent the bill to a debt collector...for $4.86. 

There are also other issues with the complex that have been pointed out in other reviews (primarily the lack of parking spaces, the propensity to tow cars, no gym), but our main issue was with the lack of humanity in the management team. We promised things we never received, personal items were ruined in our apartment with no remorse, we didn't receive our security deposit back due to normal wear and tear after six years, and worst of all, they attempted to illegally kick us out after we had a baby.

The canal is amazing, the location is fantastic, but I'm not sure it's worth the treatment we received from management.",2021-01-27 15:22:07,572,2852,

How could I have forgotten to write a new review for one of my favorite restaurants for burgers, chicken wings and onion rings. It's an error, I need to correct now. 

I'll start with the Onion Rings. No matter what I am having, burgers or wings, I always start out with an order of OR's as an appetizer. They are huge rings, that are hand dipped and coated with a flavorful batter that is fried to a crisp. No side is needed for dipping, but sometimes I dab a little ketchup on one or two of them.

Their burgers are 10 oz. of Angus beef. My go to order is always a cheeseburger. My cheese choice is Pepper Jack and I have it prepared to a medium rare. Their kitchen always get the temp right and I love how the cheese is completely melted and dripping down the edges like icing on a cake. The fries are always crisp on the outside and soft and hot on the inside. Best of all, they're crinkle fries which are my favorite to accompanying a burger. 

In closing, I tell you Seamus has some of the best wings in the city. They are not batter, fried crisp, meaty and tossed in a house sauce that is a medium spicy. I'm a counter, so I like that when I order the wings at Seamus, I get the same number of flats and little drums. If your not a sauce person like one of my friends, you can order the wings plain and have your sauce on the side. They also give you a choice of Ranch and Blu Cheese for dipping. I like their sauce so much, I don't dip in either dressing. 

Customer service is what you'd expect at an Irish pub. It's attentive, but they also leave you alone so you can have a conversation. 

My visit during the pandemic were safe. Once I was on the patio and recently, we were one of two tables in the dining room with plenty of space between us. 

If you go, order the Onion Rings!

The problem was that I realllllly wanted sushi, and my partner (a crazy person who does not like sushi) reallllly wanted Chinese food. Enter Dragon House! Though Dragon House opened a few years ago, we had yet to try their multitude of offerings; what better time than the holiday season?

We opted to try some wasabi shumai  for a starter. Just looking at them I wasn't confident in any wow-ing flavor, but these little guys packed a secret little wasabi slow burn! They were a yummy little snack. My partner ordered his favorite go-to Americanized Chinese food dish, General Tso's. He was rather happy with the amount of sauce on the well-cooked chicken pieces, and reports that the sauce was not just some sugar slurry that was whipped up in a minute. It was a nice blend of savory and sweet. In keeping with the theme of the evening, I decided to try the Christmas Roll (for something new) and the Philly Roll (for something classic to compare to). Both were tightly rolled, flavorful, and delicious. I am rather critical when trying a new sushi place, and the rolls at Dragon House passed the test. Nothing was fishy, smelly, or odd in color. I can't entirely speak to the freshness of the fish as I didn't order any sashimi, but with the experience I had with the rolls I would be willing to try it!

The food was ready promptly and handed over safely with some complimentary sesame rice krispie-like treats! I definitely will be back to try some more of the menu!",2021-01-16 13:51:32,327,1597,

After spending three years with St. George and Associates,  (two at Beach Shitty) I saw the true side of their management practices. All they care about is money and do not look into anything beyond that. Case in point; half of these reviews were written positively due to the incentive from management to have fees waived or some other form of assistance. All the owner cares about is becoming as rich as possible (you should see his mansion in Hope Ranch) and instead of fixing the COUNTLESS problems here, he is just building new properties across SB to increase his wealth. 

Kids overdose here all the time and get addicted to hard drugs (cocaine, ketamine, LSD) as they can often buy them from their next-door neighbor. Security is a joke and only care about the noise complaints from the neighbors up the street (who all hate Beach City) and have little interest in the wellbeing of the tenants. I've had countless things stolen here, including an expensive bike which was securely locked to a bike rack. The metal lock was sawed in half along with my girlfriends bike and many others. Management did nothing to resolve this. The MOST they will ever do is apologize and then lie directly to your face just to make you happy. I personally have been lied to a numerous amount of times, and the only person who refused to lie to tenants no longer works there... Strange isn't it? The only positive aspect about the people who work for them is the amazing students they hire to essentially take the blame for everything the upper management fails or chooses not to remedy.

Best lobster bisque I've ever had. Very creamy and full of flavor. Savored every bite and would get it again in a heartbeat.

For the entree, I got the ""flight of beef"" which is 3, 4 oz filets (prime, grassfed and wagyu). You can add ""personalization"" to the steaks, and I tried the Chop sauce (their version of steak sauce) and Horseradish cream. My favorite of the three was the prime, followed by wagyu, then grassfed (slightly too chewy for my liking). I'd recommend trying to eat most of the steak when it first arrives at the table. The plates are room temperature, and the steaks quickly go from piping hot to room temperature once you cut into them. I really enjoyed the horseradish cream and for those familiar with some that have a kick, this one wasn't too overpowering. 

The sides are a la carte, and serve 2-3 people. We tried the shoestring fries, twice broiled yukon potatoes and broccolini. The yukon potatoes were my favorite, and they are served mashed with sour cream and some other spices. I would probably pass on the broccolini next time, they were kind of dry in my opinion. 

For dessert we tried a chocolate raspberry cheesecake with oreo crust. It had a light rich flavor and was enjoyed by everyone at the table. 

Overall, we had a wonderful experience. My only gripe would be that the service was a tad slow (we had a reservation at 7pm and didn't finish up until 930pm).

Hot Tip to save: this location is the main UPS Store for all Amazon Prime free returns. If you need to return something your ordered, you're going to have to come to theis store in order to send back your package.

Since the pandemic began, I'm sure I'm not the only person who has relied heavily on Amazon for shopping. While I've done my best to support local business, there are so many things that are just so easy to locate and purchase with the click of a button on my phone. But like anything else in this world, some things you just HAVE to return. 

This particular UPS store is very centrally located in the city. You used to be able to make Amazon returns at the UPS distribution center on Jefferson, but for whatever reason, this is now the only location that accepts returns. And they do so graciously. 

I have never had a poor customer service experience when returning an Amazon package at the Central West End UPS Store. They make the whole process incredibly easy. You show them the automatically generated barcode on your phone. It's scanned. They take the package. You leave. Simple as that!

I also really appreciate how seriously they are handling COVID precautions. The store is fairly small, and there is usually a line outside because they will only let a certain amount of people inside the building at any given time.

I remember when they opened in my neighborhood, all I could think was 'I need to check them out'. Here comes the embarrassing part: the first time there was today. I'll see myself out after this review is posted. 

A friend suggests that I try their food. She swears by their 'Highway to Kale' salad. I wasn't feeling a salad today so I perused their menu online I saw a lot of items that sounded appealing. The one that caught my eye was their 'Bubba' burrito. I hadn't eaten in about 17 hours so that sounded like today's choice. It's normally served with Pinto beans but there's something about those kinds of beans that I don't care for so I asked for black beans instead. 

When I popped in to buy the item, the cashier handed the burrito to me. It was not light. This, to me, seemed like a good thing. 

The moment I got home, I carefully opened the foil and to my delight, inside what a perfectly wrapped, self-contained item waiting to be consumed. One bite in and I was already taken back at the freshness. Looking back after everything was clear, I wish I would have asked for fresh jalapeño to be added. I have to wait for this to digest before I can go back and get another one even though my eyes are looking at this photo, remembering how delicious this was. 

If you've driven by one of their two locations here in town and always thought, 'I need to go in there', do yourself a solid and GO INSIDE.

*sigh* I try to be understanding, especially in this Covid age but oofa! Fair warning this one is gonna be a bit on the long side, so the TLDR: not worth the money. Ok, let's start with the positives

The Good: I'm leading off with the best person in the building. David the breakfast attendant was all I could ask for. His level of hospitality was right up there with any I've ever experienced. Seriously, he could teach lessons (to some of the people on staff). The hotel bartender was also very warm and welcoming, the valet guys always greeted us but then again I didn't have to drop $30/night because I didn't drive. The location is also a plus.......sort of. You're centrally located and on the outskirts of the ""middle"" of downtown but just a heads up there's a homeless PROBLEM!!!!

The bad: This place needs security in the worse way!!!! We had THREE run-ins with homeless people in the hotel, including the instant we walked in. Mid check in a homeless guy comes up to us in the lobby and starts asking us to call 911 because he's having a heart attack. Come to find out that he does this on a regular basis! My favorite part of the ordeal was the the guy checking us in is looking at us for help. ""Sir we don't live here, I'm pretty sure this falls under your jurisdiction"". The second interaction came as we returned late one night, we were on the 6th floor where there's a conference room. A guy was up there using the men's room, I thought he was just a guest but then the light bulb went on, I asked if the toilet in his room was clogged and he just made a bee line for the elevators. The third was coming out of out room and seeing a kid just sitting outside our door. After looking left and right for his parents I asked if he was ok, and he walked to the elevators too....WTF.

Another notch in the bad category is the smell. The lobby and especially STINK to high heaven. I don't know if its a sewer issue but we were there for six days and it never went away. I would've complained about it but, bad notch #3

THERE'S NEVER ANYONE AT THE FRONT DESK!!!!!!! Seriously, every time I needed something I had to have a Marco Polo like scavenger hunt. I'm not unreasonable, I understand that people want to sit down and be on their phone (seriously every employee that came out of the back room after I bellowed had their cellphone in their hands) how about pulling up a chair and hiding the phone under the counter where the customer can't see? 

The final bad was a personal one (hopefully it won't happen to you). I booked through a third party site so to reserve the room I used my ""internet credit card"" I keep a card with just enough money to pay for streaming service because I have prescription grade trust issues. When I checked in (after the guy doing his Fred Sanford impersonation) I told the guy checking in that I wanted to put the room on my ""real"" credit card, he told me not to worry about it until I check out, cool I thought.... the day before I check out I'm getting alerts for overdraft. I check and see that they're trying to put the hotel on the internet card. After going to the front desk (real credit card in hand) I'm told again that it was a mistake and not to worry about it until check out. The next night while out at dinner they tried to charge my internet card SIX FRAKKING TIMES!!!!! It happened so often that my bank called me thinking it was a fraud charge or that my card was stolen. I went back with a righteous fury and was told that no one had mentioned this to the Saturday person. My god people get your communication together!!!

Now for the strange: For whatever reason, at least on the sixth floor, there's extension cords everywhere that just dead end behind random doors. I'm not sure what's behind those doors but I'm guessing a TARDIS!!!!

I seriously thought about asking for my money back after the credit card fiasco but I just decided to not stay at the chain anymore.",2021-01-08 06:06:57,884,3971,

As we were seated, the host explicitly told us that if we wanted to move our two separate tables closer together that it would be fine AS LONG AS THEY DIDN'T TOUCH. With that direction, we did. 

The waitress came to take our drink order but told us the tables had to be separated. We explained that the host/person who seated us said that it would be fine and were just going with what he had told us. We did not ask to move the tables closer and we did move the tables back because we wanted to eat and had made the reservations already. 

Her approach was super rude toward us, even though it was her fellow coworker who made the mistake. Not even an apology in the miscommunication, just a direct order to move the tables. I think my party all felt like leaving after that encounter as we all were hesitant to order drinks. She even interrupted one of my party member's orders to physically push the table from out in front of them without a heads up because I guess we didn't push them apart past where they were originally set up?

The waitress then told one party member that he shouldn't order a side of fried rice since our sushi came with rice already. Another server who dropped off food wasn't even able to read the names at the top of our tickets to us. She didn't understand the question at all and grabbed another server.

P7plodd4xIa0g-OpijJtLw,nG3Mek6QUuC44ej8hMnTxg,EUwQbPPvacOk3hZLb_2pGw,1,3,1,0,"Right before the pandemic started, I was searching for a Tattoo artist in the Philadelphia area to do a Rocky II movie poster image on my leg. I'm a huge fan of Rocky, and have the movie posters in my house, I've flown out to Philly to run the stairs, statue, and the tourist Rocky fan things you can think of. How iconic would it be to fly out there and get the tattoo done in Philadelphia right??
After weeks of searching yelp, google, etc, I found Sean Costello at Central Tattoo Studio in Philly. Out of all the artists in Philadelphia, I believed his work was the best and would feel comfortable with him doing this piece. I also noticed on the Yelp reviews that there have been people in the SF Bay Area and one review from where I lived that had come out to this studio for work. I figured if people from California came out all the way to Philly for work, then they must be that good right?
 I scheduled the appointment the week that the pandemic hit not knowing the magnitude of it at the time. I don't think anyone did, to be honest. Sean had me waiting 45 minutes before he finally came out for the consultation. I was a little bothered but what the hell, it was my birthday, I was going to get this epic Rocky II movie poster blasted on my leg by one of the best in Philly.
During the pandemic, I kept up on the news, followed Sean on IG, and waited for them to reopen. When sanctions were lifted, I reached out to the studio in July and was told he was backlogged with appointments and to check back in Fall/ Winter. Since I was heading out in August 2020 I thought we would be able to get started but I totally understood the backlog of work. I then reached back out last week 01/04/21 to see if he was available for Feb 21' and he wasn't available till March/ April. Then Sean reached out and stated, "" I think it would also probably be best, if I am doing the piece, to work on this piece post covid. To be honest, with everything that's going on now I'm not keen on tattooing someone that needs to fly to get tattooed."" I get the whole covid thing, but what does someone flying in to get a tattoo to have to do with being able to do the work or not. Flying, driving in, living down the street is no different. Covid is everywhere, if covid is your concern, then you shouldn't be working in the first place. California is the same strain as in Pennsylvania and New York. Why does my piece need to be post covid? I never tested positive out of the hundreds of tests I've taken, and if anything I would be more concerned getting it from a tattoo artist that deals with people out of his household. What about other people that come in for work? Are you not worried about them? I honestly felt when we initially met, and even my girlfriend pointed this out, Sean seemed low key flakey being 45 min late to consultation and gave off some racial vibes. They prob don't get a lot of Latinos going in so I can see why I've been getting the runaround. They knew I was flying in to get this work done back in March, and in July, why is flying for a tattoo an issue now? Lol 
I ended up telling Sean if you can't do it just say so, and he told me I should find another spot. Which I gladly will. I did the same thing in New York and had a Statue of Liberty blasted on my leg in March 2020 and worked on Aug 2020 and will be back in Feb to have it finished. And guess what? I flew in all those times during covid, no issues. Go figure! lol",2021-01-08 17:58:06,756,3444,

-Location: 5 minutes from Reno airport, so convenient!

-Nearby Food: while the restaurant's here are amazing they are a bit pricey for the everyday meal. In less than 10 minutes you can get anything from outback, Olive Garden, macaroni grill, sonic, chic-fil-a, and so much more including grocery stores!

-Amenities: It's always a plus when you have a hotel that gives water, cups (and extra), coffee maker+single coffee pods and tea, on top of the usual toiletries. The only downside was not having a mini fridge. But an ice bucket did the job five.

-Casino: With a large casino how can you not find a game or machine you like!!

-Cleanliness: everything from the clean room, lobby, additional covid precautions like entry temperature checks and hand sanitizer stations everywhere, you also see workers constantly cleaning s as NGD wiping machines.

-Parking: they have a large enough lot, never had an issue getting a stall although it may fill up and you'll just walk a bit more but it was free and fine.

Other Pros:
-Nice water fountains out front with sync and elaborate water routines. 

-loved the Christmas lights all outside and on the trees near the fountain. I know it was right after the holidays and may not be year round but it was beautiful! 

Biggest PRO: 
-PRICE: I booked on Priceline and it was a last minute trip due to changes and granted it was the genius online deal but it was $36 a night for a 2 queen room!!! Granted your resort fees and all but seriously!!! I was in awe this was 200% worth it, I would definitely stay here again even if the price is more lol

Only downside: I wish I had taken more photos to share how wonderful our experience was despite being in this covid era.",2021-01-17 08:27:17,386,1861,

I first called in to check if there was a wait to get seated since after calling many many downtown restaurants, every single one had at least an hour wait. The gentleman on the phone was super nice and said no wait so decided to drive over. The parking is easy and luckily there was 2 open spots. Walked in and asked the front order desk what was the most popular pizza. They suggested either the San Gennaro or the Desano. The biggest difference they said was the San Gennaro has peppadews vs the Desano has pepperoni. I opted for the San Gennaro  since I really like the sweetness the peppadews add. I also want to add the guy taking my order was extremely nice. Customer service and politeness you almost never experience these days. 

After ordering, me and my son walked into the dining room where there are long picnic bench style to find a seat. Plenty of seating to be able to social distance which was great. I then took my son up to the area where you can watch the guys making the pizza. Out of the blue, one of the guys asked if my son would like a piece of pizza dough to play which I initially said no to. But after asking my son if he wanted it, I asked the guy if I could have a piece. So he cut a piece of the pizza dough, put it on a tray with some flour. My 3 year old son was pretty occupied with it while waiting for the pizza so I want to THANK that guy for the kind thought and gesture. 

The pizza took maybe 15 min or so to come out and it looked delicious. 16"" pizza with sausage, peppadews, onions and some more ingredients. My son loved it and I did as well since we both finished the whole 16"" pizza while we were there. Also while we were eating several people stopped by to ask if we needed anything which was nice as well. I just have to say that all around we had an unbelievable experience at Desano. An experience you will almost never find at a restaurant these days. I wish I lived in Nashville because this would be a weekly spot for my family if we did. I definitely will be back next time I am in Nashville!!!",2021-01-24 13:38:51,463,2172,

The location is perfect, situated in Tierra Verde and right on the intercoastal. In close proximity from anywhere in St Pete. Great views. You can boat or drive here.
They have a pool on premises which is great for the kiddos or anyone just looking to come for a few drinks and take a dip. The pool is NOT heated, just an FYI. It gets really cold in the cooler months. 
I have eaten here many times. The salads are the best. Very fresh ingredients so you can't go wrong. The Greek salad has potato salad on it, which I love, but it is not for everyone. And they are HUGE, you will be having two meals in one. My boyfriend had the filet here not that long ago, and I am telling you, it was better then Bern's Steakhouse. And I can say that because we had just been to Bern's (my first time) in December. Amazing. I also love their wings, Dallas style. Big and meaty with lots of sauce. I can usually only make it through about 4 or 5 before I am super full.
One of my friends who I brought to Island Grille recently said the New England clam chowder was the best she has ever had, and she is FROM New England. Homemade with large chunks of smoked bacon apparently. 
The service is always consistent as well. Although there is a decent amount of turnover, all servers are very polite, knowledgeable, and efficient. 
They also have a great bar staff with great drinks. Try the Megamosa, it is filled with vodka, OJ, and a full mini bottle of champagne, check out the pics. You only need one. Great martinis as well.
Oh and the staff are adhering to covid safety measures with table spacing and face masks. Plenty of hand sanitizer provided throughout the facility and facemasks at the door if needed. 
I have never had a negative experience here. Only positive!!
They do happy hour each day until 6pm. I know their wines and beer are discounted. They also do daily specials. On Tuesdays, you can get 75 cent oysters. And they are large and out of this world!
There are 3 bars on premises. Inside, outside, and the tiki pool bar. So there is never an alcohol shortage. 
The parking plentiful. There is no valet (yay!). 
There is also a brand new hotel next to The Island Grille. They boast a rooftop bar. So after your awesome dinner, you may want to head up the elevator to the rooftop for a beautiful view and some good cocktails. 
Definitely worth a try as a local and a tourist. You will be a regular in no time!",2021-01-25 21:15:28,550,2521,

Usually they're composed mostly of filler type food-carby stuff that will give you a serotonin fix and later make you want to loosen your pants and take a nap. Frankly, I can easily accomplish all of that at home without ever having to get dressed or spend anything...

The only reason I ever patronized Sitar India was because my late friend, Dee, was a vegetarian on a slim budget. If I wanted to go out with her and have a really fine meal, be it brunch/lunch/dinner, I would just tell her to leave her wallet home as I would be treating. Otherwise, when we'd eat out, we would agree beforehand to split the bill and if I was the person whose turn it was to choose the restaurant, I'd keep Dee's budget and food prefereneces in mind. If forced to eat with her at an Indian buffet, my pick was always New Delhi but Dee insisted the food was 'way too spicy.' It wasn't, but if we really love our friends, we spend some time humoring them. 

Sitar India, while always bustling, never failed to have a free table for us, the waiters were reasonably civil and the restaurant and restrooms were clean. If I recall, you can order a la carte, but Dee much preferred to get the most bang for her hard earned buck so we always ordered the lunch buffet, which was in the neighborhood of $12.95 or so. It bought one numerous return trips to the steam tables for standard items of North Indian cuisine as well as chai and dessert. 

Nothing stands out in my mind as stellar or even memorable. It's generic North Indian food in a university area of town, geared for hungry folks who don't have a lot to spend or who do have the means but don't want to part with much money. Heaping helpings of basmati rice, at least one biryani, warm naan, lots of lentils, green peas, chickpeas, potatoes, heavy sauces, a salad bar, samosas, goat and chicken curries and so on all on the steam table to fill one up on the cheap. They provide condiments in the way of chutnies, raitas (though technically that is NOT a condiment...) and so on so all your food needs are met. I never had a 'bad' meal here and no complaints about food not being fresh. On the other hand, I also never remembered what I ate a few hours later, nor did I ever feel compelled to take a second pass at the buffet offerings once I'd cleaned my plate the first time.  If you do go back for seconds and thirds the way my friend always did, your used plates and cutlery are quickly removed and your water glass is kept full. While lingering is not encouraged, as long as you're eating, no one is going to remind you that it's time to hit the road. 

If it's rent week, if it's a weekend and you just feel a need to get out of the house for a bit, eat to groaning capacity all things that are inexpensive but not burgers, burritos, bagels, pizza or eggs, then return home to vegetate and snore on the couch, this place most certainly has YOUR name on it.

We had arranged to check out the newest Tampa chocolate shop and pick up a few goodie for an event I'm hosting! Of course that means several bags of their infamous chocolate covered popcorn!!!

The heavenly smell of chocolate beckons to you as you enter the front door. But not over powering! Then you're visually greeted with the bright and colorful shelves full of meticulously arranged chocolates. They definitely have plenty of unique treats like bacon peanut bars and spicy chilly nut bars! There was a cool rotating display of assorted gelatos. They had several football (for Super Bowl Sunday) assortments including a large chocolate football full of chocolate covered popcorn! Tampa Bay sports teams are well represented here, Rays, Bucs, Lightning chocolate treats galore!! And let me. It forget the all important candy holiday coming soon, Valentines Day! Peterbrooke had shelves full of artful chocolate boxes, baskets and even cocoa bombs! Yes they have assorted cocoa bombs!!! It appeared most treats came in milk, dark and white chocolate. 

We purchased a few assorted chocolates from the case, a vegan chocolate bar, a hand dipped chocolate covered strawberry (that was hard to resist in the drive home but was the first thing I ate when I got in!), chocolate covered Oreos, pistachio chocolate bar and a Valentine heart shaped cocoa bomb.

Because they are always booked up and we are lazy at making reservations (Hint, hint). We smartened up and made a reservation for a Thursday and were happy we did. 
First, the Devour menu was wonderful (and INCLUDED a cocktail or wine). Although we stuck to the limited devour menu, the regular menu looked amazing. It was hard to stick to the plan - Devour only! 
For cocktails: we opted for a ""Hunka burnin love"" which reminded me of a chocolate martini. It was very good and (get this) had a peanut butter rim with crispy yummy crumbles on it! My husband had a ""live and let die"" with pineapple and lime notes. I very much dislike rye and enjoyed this drink. 
Appetizers: The husband had a tomato bisque with (optional) lump crab meat. It was very good, rich and slightly chunky, with lotsa flavor. It was for the true tomato lover. I opted for the Cesar salad with (optional) anchovies. Let me tell you... this was a traditional Cesar salad, but done perfect. The dressing was clearly house made and creamier than cream. Amazing. 
Dinner: We had penne ala pesto and risotto aka Sangiovese. We liked both, but didn't love. The pesto dish was a penne with mushrooms, shrimp in a pesto cream sauce. I found it heavy on sauce and heavy on the pesto (as opposed to being more of a light cream sauce with a little pesto). The risotto was good but almost had too many flavors going on. Portions were large and they came out piping hot! 
For dessert: we got one of each a cannoli and a tiramisu. Both were good. The cannoli had to be made in house as it was crispy and fresh with a perfect creamy filling. The tiramisu was liked better by my husband (not a coffee drinker) than me (coffee drinker). I could hardly taste the espresso, he was happy it was barely there.
The service was lovely, the atmosphere was very nice and high end. I don't love too fancy, and although it came across super fancy, the staff made it feel more personable and less stuffy. During Covid, they did a nice job of social distancing and other precautions. We felt well taken care of. 
We will likely be back to try different entrees because I am determined to give 5 stars. I think we just lucked out on our choices and it was likely a taste preference over quality, but we will try again.",2021-01-29 01:31:08,513,2363,

During a very difficult time after the passing of my mother-in-law we had to move  the contents of her home quickly. We rented two PODS to go to different parts of the country. From the beginning we were given mis-information. They were quick to drop off the pods and start charging us (also got the two pods mixed up and would have delivered them to the wrong places) but slow to pick them up so they could continue charging us. We had damage done to one property (grass and bush damaged, oil from hydraulic on bushes, scrapes on cement). We were charged an extra month for one pod because it took them over two weeks to pick it up. I have tried to get a refund for it but without them wanting me to sign legal waivers (one actually wanted me to waive my right to talk to anyone outside of my immediate family about my experience and waive my right to give any negative feedback to social media or the BBB). They assigned me a ""Customer Advocate"" that was no help at all.  They also had a ""glitch"" in their system that showed my account as past due and charged a late fee on a zero balance of $25.00.  I was getting past due emails. My ""Customer Advocate"" would not handle that for me just gave me yet another person to call and indicated that it could have a negative impact on  my credit. Hard to imagine when my account was on autopay with a credit card with no limit. We filed a claim on the property but never heard from anyone until I told the Customer Advocate that I wouldn't sign the waiver because this wasn't resolved.

To make matters even worse when you fill out their survey about your negative experience, they will respond with a certified letter essentially calling you a liar and excuse them of any wrong doing. I received more medical care, kindness and empathy from the paramedic en route to the ER than I did once at the ER. I was completely unconscious and down for 10 mins when the paramedics arrived on scene. They were able to revive me and while in the ambulance the paramedic felt that it was important to start an IV, give me nausea medication and explain to me I needed to go to the ER for further medical attention for the nature of my unconsciousness and 911 call. Either WMC ER was trying to tell me their paramedic is untrained and misdiagnosed the situation or they support their physicians decision treat certain patients like worthless human beings and do as little as possible. Maybe because I don't have health insurance so did not want to waste their resources on me.. If a patient is dizzy,nauseous, throwing up and suffering from a horrible headache/migraine I imagine IV fluids would be necessary and helpful. The paramedics certainly felt it was necessary but apparently the hospital did not feel rehydration was necessary or any treatment for that matter.  Not even an anti nausea pill.

Came in and let the the server (Lynn) know that we were trying to call to make a reservation and she looked at my friend and i and said, ""well i can't do everything."" In a undermining tone. Made us feel VERY unwelcomed. We were seated and gave it to a child size paper water cups as our drinks. Confused on that, when everyone else around has had the iconic Pepsi cup. When we asked for water in a bigger cup, we got an eye roll. 
Once she took our food preset, (two burgers off the HH menu) I order 6 wings and asked for those to come out first and we'll done. With a response of, ""I'll try, but i don't think it can get it out fist because wings take longer to cook."" So confused, i said to myself, why not put the order of wings in before the burgers? Anyway. Never once got check on, never got refills. Once our burgers came out, we asked for mustard, ketchup and barbecue sauce (burgers come dry) and our server again rolled her eyes and came back and said do you guys want anything else as if we were making it an inconvenience for her. Mind you, there were at this time only two other tables in the restaurant. After my meals was ready for a box I asked for one and asked her if my friend and I did something to offend her because we feel the coldness, and annoyance towards us. Of course her mood shifted and she said she was just  frustrated with herself. I totally get that! But to make other people feel like they are the issue isn't okay. We then waited 35 min to get our check, and this point to just walked over to her and gave her my card because we didn't want to wait much longer. 

Bullys used to be a safe place to me. My friend and I were the only two in there of color and you could FEEL and SEE the difference in quality service to lack of.

Plus, I am intentional about supporting black-owned businesses because well..I love and support my people but this was not okay. I've visited this place many times over the past few months because I love their fried wings and fish. This time however was 1 of 2 instances when the wings I ordered was undercooked. 

The first instance I called back after I got home and the cook (older guy) answered. I explained the problem, offered to send photos (because I couldn't return then), but he said it wasn't necessary. He apologized for the mistake, and offered to replace them during my next visit along with a 10% off any order on top of it. I accepted and redeemed the replacement a few days later. The 10% was never offered as agreed but still I didn't push the issue. 

Here we are again with the same issue (in photos) and again I called back and spoke with a MOD. I explained and she immediately apologizes but tells me she can only offer me a 10% off. I refused because after spending $20+ on lunch I couldn't eat, 10% was unacceptable and felt like a shrug of the shoulder. She tells me that she will take my name and number and would inform her boss so that she can call me to sort it out. After not receiving a call, I followed up again and I was told and I quote ""my boss said that she fries the wings Kay's way and she can only offer you 10% off and a free slushy"". I'm thinking like what? Kay's way? What does that mean? Plus, I'm sure ""Kay's way"" doesn't mean undercooked. Still, I tell the MOD that's not good enough and that I'd like my food replaced or fully refunded. After all, you've sold me undercooked wings twice, which is a bigger issue as to how your food is being prepped. Still, she tells me she'll pass the message along to her boss. I mean, this is really frustrating. The photos I thought to take after the call doesn't really do them justice. They were dryer by this point but looked much worse when I first got them home. I ordered 15 wings and there was at least 6 of them undercooked that could find before I got tired of picking through them. This needs to remedied right away.

This facility has been open to the public for a couple years now, rolling up their doors on weekend afternoons to serve up pints and beer to-go.

This being their main warehouse and production site, you get some great values from their dock-sale prices.  There are typically about a half-dozen beers on taps, usually newer or seasonal brews, with most pours being around $4-$5 per pint.  All their main flagship beers are likewise for sale in cans for $3 each, and crowler fills, beer packs, and keg rentals are all available here, too.  Outside there is a grill set up, with the staff cooking up burgers and brats, with a combo plate including chips and a beer running you around $10.  Service here has also always been very prompt and friendly, with bartenders usually wanting to talk about the newest addition to their tap list.

The newly expanded indoor space itself is great for hanging around and enjoying a few drinks.  You'll find much more indoor seating space, all socially distanced, and a few outdoor picnic tables in the back patio area.  Several televisions are usually playing whatever games are on, and you can partake in all manner of bar games like cornhole and giant jenga, among others.  There is also plenty of swag on display for purchase, ranging from shirts, to growlers, to more interesting sorts of gear and paraphernalia.  Still, as staff will tell you, the whole place is still a bit of a work in progress.  So stay tuned for more forthcoming updates including an expanded bar, more seating, and even a pizza oven.

Being located right near the river and Mayberry Park, this gives them an amazing location to for folks to snag a pint or two after relaxing at the river or a day on the trails.  With abundant parking, it is easy enough to drive over, or even just walk from the park.  Just be sure to drive slow and stay attentive around the warehouse complex, as there can be heavy foot and vehicle traffic in and out of the various businesses.

All in all, Brewer's Cabinet continue to be one of my go-to craft beer spots in Reno, be it downtown or out here.  For sure will be back, looking forward to another pint of Dragon Punch or Dirty Wookie.

Cheers, guys!",2021-01-22 19:11:21,478,2363,

In a normal year we would already have tried several places, but 2020 was anything but normal.  We did ask neighbors for recommendations and they all suggested a place that was at LEAST an hour round trip, which wasn't appealing.  We are so glad we didn't do that, as it's hard to believe the selection, food, and service could have been better than Liang's Bistro!  We selected coconut shrimp as the appetizer, as well as entrees of beef, chicken, and pork, along with vegetable fried rice.  Cameron answered and repeated the order back exactly right.  I arrived to pick it up about 5 minutes before he said it would be ready.  It was being packaged as I arrived.  The total was exactly as he stated.  Of course that shouldn't be an issue, but it seems to happen so again, nice work Cameron.

When I walked through the door the place smelled just wonderful.  The voices all seemed calm and organized though it was obviously busy in the kitchen.  I only saw 1 couple dining there, but the place is charming and when the worst of Covid passes, I definitely intend to return to dine in.  

When I unpackaged our order each item was in nice a container, no leaks or mess outside the containers.  Everything was still warm to eat without reheating.  We smiled at the couple extra fortune cookies beyond one per meal, a nice touch.  The items we ordered were beautifully prepared.  No overcooked vegetables, mushy rice or sauces that all tasted the same.  Each was quite distinctive, as they should be.  Great job!  A completely positive experience!

Will never eat at this establishment again. The one star that I am giving this restaurant is undeserving. I'm not one to complain about food let alone service but tonight was different. I ordered a simple steak burrito and took one bite and it was terrible. Being that this place is a ""Cantina"" I was expecting something totally different. The rice tasted like it was from a box of Zatarain's and the steak was marinated in an odd flavor (not mentioned in the menu - because had I known I wouldn't have ordered it) mixed with beans, sour cream, lettuce, etc. I took one bite and realized that I did not want to continue eating the steak burrito anymore and politely asked if I was able to order something different. The server said probably not because of the ""policy"" but he would ask. Both the manager and the owner who was present at the time told the server to (QUOTE) ""relay the message"" that due to their ""restaurant policy"", they weren't going to accommodate my request to order something else in place. The server went on to tell me it's because they already used their resources and its not an issue on their end that I didn't like the burrito. Further, not only did the manager nor owner ever come out to talk to us directly they refused to take the burrito off of our bill. I'm surprised that this restaurant is still in business with that kind of service. It's evident that the owner/mgmt does not care about customer service or wants of the people who dine at their restaurant whatsoever. Extremely disappointed that during this type of pandemic they would still treat the few dine-in, paying patrons as such. I have never in my life been to an establishment that had such blatant disregard for a guest's dining experience. It's also probably why none of the poor reviews are even acknowledged by management on these very forums. A Walmart McDonald's would have given me better customer service than what I encountered tonight. Sad to say, but so true in this case.

Giving this place 4 stars because food was great but the cashier taking our order had a horrible attitude/customer service. 

Customer service: We were the only customers there at the time and were not greeted at all by the staff. I forgot my glasses so I had to take time viewing the menu. A female staff member finally came by after standing there for a few minutes and the first thing she says (very shortly) was ""be right with you"". We weren't ready to order yet because there were so many items to choose from and we were debating on getting a meatball sub or slice of pizza. The female staff member was standing at the register at this point and was rolling her eyes at us and answering us as if we were annoying her every time we asked a question about an item on their menu. So at this point, I was frustrated and just ordered 3 pizzas by the slice. When another customer came, she was completely nice to them. 

Environment: dining area was clean. Staff wore masks. 

Food: the single slice pizzas are HUGE! Literally one slice is equivalent to 2 (full) or 3 (thin sliced) pizzas. They have a single slice cheese pizza special with a 20oz drink for $7.50! Definitely worth it. You have the option to add toppings for an extra charge.

It's the most popular which almost guarantees a fresh bottle opened for your wine pour. The split pea & ham soup was packed with thick pasty pea flavors with a touch of sodium flavor. Not at all salty. The soup was and very moist, not to mention packed with little ham cubes.  I ordered a bowl of the roasted tomato soup, which was awesome. Very good roasted tomato flavors, low on sodium too. If you like salads, be prepared to have leftovers. The salads are very large topped with all sorts of veggies, and cheese of your choice.

I was pleasantly surprised and my expectations were exceeded way beyond my imagination. The popping tomatoes, the goat cheese, and the chimichurri sauce elevated this dish beyond its original limit. All the cocktails are great, can't go wrong with any of them. 

I also ordered a bread pudding for dessert, not on the menu, but recommended by the waiter. At first glance, it's underwhelming and very ""not"" bread pudding. It appeared to be more of a burnt toast. But once it's in your mouth, there are waves of different flavors and textures, hitting in intervals. It was an EXPERIENCE in every bite. I was in heaven.
 
If you've ever taken a psychedelic, try to revisit the state you were in when you're coming down from a good trip and you're in a hazy state of calm with a lot of feelings and thoughts ruminating for a bit and then evaporating from your mind.

If you haven't taken a psychedelic, Another way to think of it is, imagine you have a typical 8 slice large pie of pizza. The first slice is fantastic. You're having a great time. The second slice is cool, you're still having a great time. The third slice, ok, the value is starting to diminish but it's good.

After moving to the west side my husband, brother, and I decided to make the 45 minute drive across town to come to our favorite pizza place. Unfortunately we had probably the worst service I have probably ever had at a bar or restaurant. First off, right when we walked in we felt unwelcome. While other people, which I'm assuming are regulars, got greeted warmly and immediately, we got the once over and were immediately asked if we were 21. We all ordered some pizza, appetizers, and a couple beers. The beer I got was not good and tasted syrupy, so after I took a sip I politely asked to have the beer replaced with something else. The server/bartender immediately said that since she poured it and I took a sip that I would still have to pay for this bad beer. My husband and I were like.... thats a strange policy to have. She became pretty argumentative, stating that every bar has that policy and if they gave everyone who didn't like their beer a new beer for free people would just do it all the time. What?! So I'm gonna take one sip of a beer, ask for a new free one, and repeat this one sip process over and over? Right... So then she asked the manager if I could have a new beer for no cost, came back with my new beer and said, ""Just so you know, I was able to take that beer off your check, just this one time."" and she continued to go on and argue with my husband about how they just lost $7 (which we all know a beer does not cost the restaurant $7 off the tap). I told my husband just to stop because we were obviously not getting anywhere with this conversation, and we ate our food feeling pretty uncomfortable for the remainder of the visit. When we were done, we paid and left without anyone saying any sort of goodbye. I have worked in the food industry my whole life and have never heard of any bar or restaurant that forces custimers to pay for drinks or food that they don't like, and also try to make them feel bad about it.

Needless to say, we will not be returning again and will also not be referring our friends anymore. We spent about $70 at this establishment and they lost our business and our referrals over a $1.50 pour of beer.

I was getting totally ignored by my G.P.'s office big time. A sweet gal that works for the Orthopedic Surgeon that I went to
2 years ago referred me to ROC urgent care. You can just show up and and see the doctor on duty.

He had the x-rays sent over from the G.P.'s office and he said the x-rays were totally unreadable and they were! So we had 
to do another set of them (my insurance company's gonna be thrilled ) and this time they did 6 views. The big difference is at Reno Diagnostics

Total discloser, I came on a day that they had free admission.  Normal admission is $17 for adults, $12 for kids. A bit on the steep side if you ask me, I would rate it on what I invested in the visit. 

The entrance to the White River Park parking garage located right in front of the museum. The ticket booth for the museum is located inside on the ground floor.  The staff there is very friendly and helpful. They are constantly cleaning and take COVID protocols serious. They have a cafe on site, that has limited seating and is a bit pricey, so I would plan accordingly.  

The museum is huge and is packed with tons of historical and interactive exhibits. They go an excellent job tying Indiana with a lot of national history events such as WWI, prehistoric times, Native Americans, civil rights, civil war, and the underground rail road. Their exhibits are masterfully put together. Some of the notable ones are the woolly mammoth, the animal display, the civil war display, the interactive wood cutting and splitting exhibits and the interactive earth/moon (Birth of the Earth) exhibit. Some of Indiana famous people are also on display in the American Originals exhibit including Madam CJ Walker, Larry Bird, Viviva Fox, Tavis Smiley, Reggie Miller, and Rupart Boneham. The little ones really enjoyed the interactiveness of the museum and it not only kept my attention and kept me engaged, It locked them in as well.

The third floor is dedicated to the interactive Fix: Heartbreak and Hope inside the Opioid Crisis exhibit.  It is very small, but extremely interactive and colorful.  

All in all, we spent almost 2 hours at the museum. FYI, this museum is located by many other museums, as well as the zoo (all within walking distance) and could be part of a larger itinerary or package deal to maximize your day. I am not sure the museum is worth the price of the regular admission and would look for one of their deals or free days they have throughout the year, but my family and I really enjoyed my complementary visit to the museum.",2021-01-18 23:53:48,434,2160,

No extra time just the hour massage.  Needless to say I didn't stay for my facial and the 2 facials and massages left(all paid for)our now useless as I'd rather pay extra and go to a real professional.  
I will say my girlfriend said the massage was good but can't get over the way she acted.

I had an appointment at 12pm confirmed by 2 texts messages yesterday.  I received a phone call from Molly to ask COVID questions about 10:45am and as we were hanging up she said see you at 11. I  corrected her and said my appointment was at 12pm and I  then checked my texts and found they sent me a text at 10:03am thus morning changing my appointment to 11am. I told Molly there was no way I could be there by 11am. I should have received a courtesy call if appointment was changing morning of. She said she would have to talk to her manager since I can't be in at 11 and would call me back. A few 
minutes later the manager called and proceeded to tell me the system says my appointment was at  11am. I told her I received 2 text message reminders yesterday for my appointment at 12pm  not 11am. She told me I would need to send her a snip it of the texts because that is not what her system says my appointment is.  I was appalled, she was basically calling me a liar and asking for proof of the text messages. I expressed this to her and she sarcastically said I'm sorry we can schedule you for another day. She proceeded to say they were having system issues. I responded how was that my issue and now I have to reschedule. Doing our whole conversation she spoke to me rudely. I told her she needs customer service training.  I asked to speak to her manager, she said she was on vacation and she would send me her email just before she rudely commented have a nice day and hung up on me. 
I was highly offended by the treatment I received and was extremely surprised that a person in management would speak to a customer in this manner and insinuate I was not being honest.  You can see for yourself I was being honest with her.",2021-01-10 19:29:12,392,1916,

We ordered a small double cheese and double pepperoni with a thin New York style crust and it was delicious. The sauce and crust were really good, and they gave us the amount of double toppings that we expected. I'd definitely order this one again.

The second pizza we ordered was a small white pizza on a thin NY style crust which was also delicious. I liked the slightly browned cheese and the liberal amount of garlic on this pie. I think next time I may try this pie with some onions and tomatoes.

For dessert we ordered the Italian doughnuts (I forgot the real name) and they were also very good. These are made with fried yeast dough and have a coating of fine sugar and a side of chocolate dipping sauce. I had several and it was a nice ending for a great meal.

The prices for this pizza were somewhat on the higher end, but I really felt that the price was reasonable for the food quality. The food was delivered quickly and was still very hot even though it was pretty cold outside. I was impressed from the first bite to the last, and wouldn't mind trying more of their menu items.

I enjoyed our first experience with Sal's, and I'm really looking forward to ordering from them again very soon!


Here's an update...

Today we ordered curbside pickup and the meals were wonderful. I ordered lasagna which was delicious. I particularly liked the fresh taste of the tomato sauce, and the mozzarella cheese they use is amazing. I'd definitely order that again. My wife ordered the chicken parmigiana which was also delicious.

You know that plastic fence It's in all the trays of sushi that you purchase.  I was thinking about that when I open up my lunch special but then I put my chopstick to the roll and my goodness how good!

This was a eat in the car meal for the three of us and each one chose a different lunch special. There was one box and then there were two who got the rolls. Believe me this place rocks! And rolls boy does it roll!!

And, the lunch prices are absolutely unbelievably low, reasonable, wow what a bargain!  For an absolutely incredibly complete lunch You pay less than you pay at one of those arched fast food joints! 

FIVE STARS start with service and customer care. from the moment I started speaking with these folks on the phone right through the pickup You can tell they cared about their customers. The inside of this restaurant obviously is geared for customer protection. There are shields and everyone is wearing a mask fully covering their nose and mouth. The cashier wears gloves on our hands. But you can sense the smiles under the masks because they care about you their customers.

The lunch is a complete lunch two rolls soup and salad for under $10. The box is under $9.

The freshness is clear from the fish and the flavors in the beef nagamaki were so yummy!

Things to love about REI in general: 
- it's $20 lifetime REI coop member price. Lots of great benefits and perks, all for only $20 over your entire lifetime. 
- dividends: being a member, you get $$ back whenever you buy full-priced items 
- the knowledge. REI has become my go-to when I have questions about anything outdoorsy, including gear, general advice and guidance, places to visit, and more
- returns: don't like something even if you've used it within the last year? Return it, no questions asked, and get a full refund.
- the garage sales: there's no hiding that REI can be quite pricey compared to to other places. If you want to get some good, used gear, be sure to hit up one of their local garage sales to buy used gear, with the reasons why they were returned very nicely displayed on the price tags so you know what you're buying. 

This particular location is quite small compared to many other locations, but I'm still happy that we have one in Indy! I most recently came to get fitted for a backpacking backpack. I was helped immediately. 

I worked with someone named Nate. He was very, very helpful. Great convo and had lots of tips and guidance for my first backpacking trip. He set me up with gear that works best for me and my needs/wants.

Party of 9 there at 3pm on Saturday afternoon.  Can only have 8 to a table because of Covid. Even though 1 of us is 2 years old in a high chair we now have TWO very large long tables that WEREN'T 6 feet apart I might add. Point being if we are going to follow rules FOLLOW ALL OF THEM! Moving on...takes almost 15 minutes for anyone to come to our tables. Clearly the 2 waitresses they have working this restaurant are completely overwhelmed.  
""Can I have a Margarita?"" No sorry NO TEQUILA until 5 pm. Puzzled ok...Ill take a such and such (dont remember the name, something dangerous water) it was blue with a few other liquors in it. ""SURE""
Someone else in our party orders a Truly seltzer.  ""No sorry we don't have that kind thats advertised to have, no we don't have that kind either!"" 
""OK just bring me what you have!"" Side note...she tried ordering ANOTHER of this flavor and no surprise it was the ONLY can in the whole house! 
My husband order's a Corona...20 minutes later they come over with a pony size.  Ummmm ok. We need refills within 15 minutes of getting the drinks  from screaming back and forth and we wait...I see now a LARGE birthday party for a child has come in and is next to us. The manager did try and have them separate than gave up for a good 30 minutes while 13 kids sat at one table (yes I was petty and counted) because my 2 year old son counted as a person in a high chair(again i get it) and we were at 2 tables for being 1 person over. Here comes my water downed full of ice done in 3 sips drink. Still wondering why I can get SOME liquor but not TEQUILA.  
FOOD...ok...my sons MEDIUM burger came out burnt. Chicken fingers were very soggy but no surprise we couldn't tell anyone because we never saw our server.  I did see 3 different manager 2 men and one women and not ONE came to our table to check on us. FINALLY all of our food comes.  No sharing plates,  no Ketchup 5 roll ups(we have 8 eating) and still waiting for our refills.  Needless to say we were done! $220 dollars later we went downstairs hungry,  thirsty and annoyed. Our so sweet overwhelmed waitress did ask at the end how was everything and when I said(being a manager myself) it wasn't a pleasant experience while screaming over the 25 kids running around the restaurant from the party next to us. She didn't even offer to have a manger come over. A manager NEVER touched our table. They were to busy clearing the tables in the bar area I guess you would call that to seat MORE ppl when they clearly couldn't handle the customers they had already and must not have gotten their beer delivery yet either. Worst experience EVER!!! I waited until Sunday night to write this and plan on calling tomorrow because they are a sports bar and it was Sunday. They can't handle what's happening inside at one time I knew it would be pointless to call and explain from the outside.  IM ONLY giving it a 1 star because the waitress TRIED.

My friend and I had dinner there the night before NYE, and they hit it out of the ball park! The service was excellent; they were attentive and gave great recommendations. 

We started with a dozen raw oysters from three different regions - AL, and two different regions in LA (can't remember where in LA) but the oysters were very fresh. I also appreciated that they gave us shallot vinegar to top our oysters with. I think it takes the flavor to the next level. 

In addition to the oysters, we are had the seafood salad and the fried bread. The seafood salad was very similar to a ceviche, which had tuna, avocado, and shrimp, served with flatbread crisps. It had a very clean and refreshing taste. The fried bread balls were delicious. It tasted similar to a salty soft pretzel. Unfortunately, I do not have any pictures of these appetizers because we were so hungry! 

For the main entree we shared the whole redfish. It was outstanding. The chimichurri sauce was superb. Needless to say, there were no leftovers. Our server recommended a great crisp bottle of white to complement our dish. It was the perfect dinner. We finished off with a slice of Key Lime Pie. Usually I'm not the biggest fan of Key Lime Pie, but this was one of the best I've ever tasted.

I found this gem a couple years ago while staying at the Sofitel hotel which is at the other end of the block from Tria. I must have gone three times the week I was there because me and my colleague couldn't get enough.

This last time I was visiting Philly with my husband and I took him on a date night to Tria. He was as impressed as I was of course.

There is a great selection of wines and the staff is always happy to help you choose one that suits your taste buds. The food is reasonably priced and the portions are generous for sharing. My absolute favorite thing on their menu was the white bean dip served with paprika toast. It is by far one of the best dishes and so incredibly flavorful. Their crostini's are also delicious. There is one with ricotta, lavender and honey that you cannot pass up. What I found interesting about Tria is that they are putting out these great dishes without a full kitchen. So there are many salads and sandwiches to choose from as well as their light bites for sharing.

There are two Tria locations although I have only been to the Tria Cafe Rittenhouse. I'm sure the other is great as well. The Rittenhouse location is perfect if you work downtown and want a place to go for happy hour or if you are planning on seeing a show and want a nice spot to grab some wine and light bites beforehand.

I don't know about you, but I'm last minute Megan... for almost everything! I got a beautiful dress from a shop in Orlando but it was simply too long and too big in the bust area. I waited until about a month or so to take my dress in to have it fitted... yeah I'm someone's worst nightmare! But let me tell you, this shop was fantastic with getting it back to me within a week or so! 

I found this shop after googling for local places to alter my bridesmaids dress. I was on a budget and was dreading to see the price. I honestly thought I was going to spend a fortune. However, when I got their the woman who did the alterations was super friendly. She explained what needed to be taken in, where it needed to be taken in, and why it cost what she quoted me. I didn't realize it when I bought it, but I had gotten a three layer dress that required all three layers to be adjusted. (I'm short and plus size, so a lot had to be adjusted to the bottom and because plus size dresses are so varied I needed the top taken in to properly fit me along with the straps)

I just have to say she did an amazing job, was an amazing price and was so pleasant! I didn't feel uncomfortable at all and she listened to me when I asked questions.

I wondered if things had changed and randomly started reading some of the reviews. Of all the places I've lived, this apartment was absolutely the worst. I've lived in several luxury apartments in DC, NY, ATL, LA and have never experienced such poor customer service. I saw at least 12 mice/rats over one month, and when I complained to the leasing office, the woman working at the time told me that other residents don't mind the rodents. That they view them ""as little cute pets."" 

I still remember that to this day. My jaw dropped to the floor and I seriously assumed that people in Philadelphia must be crazy to think it's cute to have rats in their home. 

When I tried to break my lease they weren't very cooperative, but I just could not stomach living with rats. They would literally crawl across the kitchen counter or I'd hear them once they were stuck on a glue trap. And that was just one issue! 

I've never been so traumatized in my life. I was afraid to be at home alone. This was my first apartment out of college and to pay what I did, I could never understand the poor oversight of this building. It appears Greystar has taken over the management. I hope they can finally turn things around. Just sharing this as fair warning from someone who experienced many of the same issues posted here over 10 years ago.

On 1/8/21, I and MW had dinner at Bacquet's in Eagle. For four hours, I felt as if I had been transported to France. It was a much needed respite from the past 10 months and left me feeling rejuvenated. As much as I love dining out, I've only had a handful of truly memorable meals. This was one of them. Everything about the evening, from the ambience/decor, to the food and service, was perfection. 

I ordered French Onion Soup ($15), House Green Salad ($8.50), and Saint Jacques au Saffron ($34.50). MW ordered a House Green Salad and Pork Gorgonzola ($29.50). We shared two desserts. I ordered Apple Tart For Two ($14.50); MW ordered Tuxedo Cake. I also ordered a Cherry Clafoutis ($8.50) to go.

Bacquet's French Onion soup lives up to its description ""The best you have never had in your life."" It was worth every penny. I can't imagine ever visiting this restaurant and not ordering it.

The House Salad was dressed with a balsamic vinaigrette. I don't normally care much for vinaigrettes but this one was exceptional. It is the best version of that salad dressing I've ever had. 

Saint Jacques au Saffron - four sea scallops, baked in the shell au gratin style, with a creamy saffron sauce and crusted Parmesan cheese. Served with a blended basmati and wild rice. I've always been on the fence about scallops. For such an expensive ingredient. they seemed bland and inconsequential. Not these. The delicious saffron sauce with a squeeze of lemon made this dish.

Pork Gorgonzola- Pork tenderloin medallions, panseared and served with a divinely silky port wine and Gorgonzola blue cheese sauce. Served with roasted vegetables and baby potatoes. I tried a bite of this dish and it was delicious. Perfectly cooked and the sauce was amazing.

Tuxedo Cake - white cake with layers of chocolate and white chocolate mousse, topped with chocolate ganache. This was a great cake. It wasn't too heavy and I liked that it was not overly sweet.

Apple Tart - pastry with a custard and apple filling. This version was topped with vanilla ice cream and drizzled with caramel. Simply put, this is the best apple dessert I've ever had. 

Bacquet's does not have a wine list or sell it by the glass. Instead, they have a wine room of carefully curated bottles they invite you to visit, where they help you select a bottle perfectly suited for your taste and meal. I don't normally drink, so the experience of ordering wine in a restaurant was new to me. I purchased a bottle of Saracco Moscato d' Asti. It was lovely. MW purchased a bottle of Bouchard Pere & Fils Reserve Bourgogne Pinot Noir.

I don't normally comment on the ambience of a restaurant because ultimately what I'm most interested in is the food. Visiting Bacquet's is simultaneously a very refined yet relaxed experience. You can dress up if you want, but it is not necessary. What is most important to the owners and staff is that you have a wonderful dining experience, and they go to great lengths to ensure that outcome. If you enjoy art, you're in for a treat because it is all around you. Owner/Chef Franck Bacquet is an artist. His work, including the murals, graces the walls. 

Bacquet's menu changes periodically, which is a plus in my book. The restaurant is open Tuesday through Sunday from 11:30 AM to 8 PM. They are for takeout and weekly meal specials.

After a scary drive through snow from Cooperstown, NY to Philadelphia, my buddy and I were excited to start our third leg of our East Coast Americana Tour visiting the historical sites of Philadelphia.  One of the things that we agreed we had to eat on our East Coast trip was a Philly cheesesteak in Philadelphia.  In 2017, my daughter and I visited Philadelphia for a volleyball tournament and we ate a Philly cheesesteak at Pat's King of Steaks, which is just down the road from Geno's and is its main competitor to the lofty claim of being the best cheesesteak in Philly.  In my opinion, Geno's is the winner of the cheesesteak competition between Geno's and Pat's.

During both my trips to Geno's and Pat's albeit three years apart, I visited both restaurants at night.  Both times I was nervous driving through the residential area to get to these restaurants because the streets are narrow and I've run into sketchy people.  At Geno's on this trip, a gentleman asked if we had money and loitered around as we ordered our food.  I say this to make sure people are aware of their surroundings especially at night and maybe you visit Geno's during the day.  Parking is difficult to find for Geno's as you'll have to find parking in the adjacent residential area.  As we walked to Geno's after finding parking, we were greeted by the overt neon lights advertising Geno's and serving as a beacon for Philly cheesesteak lovers to find their location.  Geno's is Cash Only, so make sure you go to the ATM or bank before you visit the restaurant.  The restaurant is order the Philly cheesesteak at one window of the restaurant and the sides/drinks at another window.  There are metal picnic benches where you can eat your food, but due to the sketchy dude and how cold it was, we decided to engulf our cheesesteak sandwich in our car.

Since we had eaten dinner, this trip to Geno's was going to be a late night snack for my buddy and I, but after eating this delicious and impeccable sandwich, we both admitted that we should not have split one sandwich and instead ordered a sandwich for each of us.  When ordering the Philly cheesesteak, there is a traditional way to order the sandwich.  The traditional way is to order the cheesesteak wit cheese whiz, which is the cheese sauce that a lot of us remember growing up as kids, and you can add grilled onions.  That's what I ordered with my daughter three years ago.  My buddy isn't a cheese whiz fan, so we decided to order our cheesesteak with provolone and grilled onions.  I highly recommend that you do the same unless you want to compare the traditional versus the way we ordered it.  The Philly cheesesteak at Geno's was heavenly scrumptious.  The meat was cooked perfectly tender, the melted provolone and the grilled onions completely enhanced the sandwich, and the bread was soft and was the perfect vessel for all of the ingredients.  We savored each bite and just couldn't stop talking about how tasty that sandwich was.  I ordered the cheese fries to go along with our sandwich and I recommend you do the same.  The fries were crunchy, seasoned right, and the melted cheese sauce was finger licking delectable.

When you visit Philadelphia, you'll have the opportunity to compare Geno's or Pat's to determine whose restaurant has the best Philly cheesesteak since they are within close proximity of each other.  I believe the winner is Geno's based on my most recent visit, but if I ever get back to Philadelphia, I want to compare apples to apples by trying the same type of sandwich at Pat's.  I'm a Philly cheesesteak fan and Geno's made me more of a fan after eating one of their sandwiches.",2021-01-26 19:03:11,768,3893,

Why is Maiz de la Vida so cool? Their tortillas are made in house - from masa they nixtamalize themselves on their very own molino (mill), which they named ""El chulo""! Maybe you know a lot about masa you're like: ""Nixtamalizing their own corn for masa? That's cool."" But maybe you're like a lot of people (me included until very recently) and you're like: ""I don't understand anything you just said."" So here's a little info so everyone can understand exactly how cool it is that Maiz de la Vida is nixtamalizing in Nashville. The process of nixtamalization was first developed in Mesoamerica  centuries ago. Essentially, it involves boiling dry corn/maize and soaking in a solution that includes slaked lime and then rinsing it before putting the nixtamalized corn through a mill that turns that nixtamalized corn into masa dough (if this was ground, sifted, and dried, it becomes the masa flour you've probably bought at the store to make tortillas) which can then be made into a number of finished products. Most restaurants serve food using tortillas they buy (there are a lot of reasons for this and there's nothing wrong with it), which makes fresh house/home-made tortillas a TREAT. A delicious, tasty, amazing treat. You can have this treat at Maiz de la Vida.

My first interaction with Maiz de la Vida was back in August of 2020, when I bought some masa from them which was delivered to my house. Just from that interaction, I was a fan. But Maiz de la Vida obviously had big plans for themselves and for Nashville - because this weekend I got to try some of their food from their AMAZING FOOD TRUCK.

As of January 2021, the food truck can be found at Richland Park Farmers Market from 10-12 on Saturdays and Chopper (the tiki bar in East Nashville) from 12-7 (I think; check their Instagram for more up-to-date information) on Sundays. I've seen on Instagram that they can have longer lines on Saturdays (so I've been told to go early if you don't want to wait in a long line and they do sell out), so we checked them out on a Sunday at Chopper. On Sundays at Chopper, you can take their food to go or they'll bring it to you inside Chopper. I hadn't been inside a restaurant or bar for several months due to the COVID numbers in Nashville, but Chopper only had 2-3 tables of people in their very large space, so we decided to eat it there and order some cocktails from Chopper as well. 

So - now that I've talked (but really written) your ear off about nixtamalization and how a food truck works - here's what you came for: THE FOOD. It's good, really good. Like all I've done since I ate there is tell people about it GOOD. On our first visit (we'll be back), we tried their mole negro enchiladas (with green chile chicken), their elote on the cob, and their beef quesabirria with consome. 

The enchiladas - I LOVE MOLE NEGRO. It's delicious, so complex (sweet, savory,  subtly hot from chiles), and always surprising (because there's no ONE recipe for mole). The chicken was also good! But the real surprise on this plate of excellent food? The escabeche (pickled veggies - jalapeno, carrot, radish)!!! I'd buy a jar. And the tortillas - OBVIOUSLY. A great dish. I'm gonna eat it again.

The elote was also great - classic, tasty, with just the right kick from the ""3 pepper mayo"" and piquin powder. Definitely a yummy side dish that hit me with a strong punch of nostalgia. 

BUT THE QUESABIRRIA. To be honest, it's why we came. I saw it on Instagram, and I had to have it. New to quesabirria or birria tacos? Birria is a slow-cooked meat stew from the state of Jalisco - traditionally goat, I think. Quesabirria is a sort of mash up of a taco and a quesadilla with consome (delicious soup)? A tortilla (a fresh and delicious AF tortilla in this case) gets dipped in the consume and then filled with cheese and the beef or the mushrooms - which we haven't tried yet but heard is great - and then griddled until crispy. You can also get a cup of consome to dip the tacos in again. Maiz de la Vida's consome is delicious - we got it, dipped our tacos, and drank the rest. Maiz de la Vida serves it with raw onion, cilantro, and a lime wedge. The consume is delicious, the tortillas are amazing, the cheese was melted and gooey, and the braised beef was delicious. This might be the best bite I've food I've had in I don't even know how long. Need a pick me up? Maybe Maiz de la Vida's cheesy, meaty, saucy, tasty quesabirria is exactly what you need.

Okay, I have now written the longest review of all time. BUT THIS IS GREAT FOOD AND YOU SHOULD TRY IT. You can support a great local business and eat amazing food at the same time.

And restaurants, lots and lots of restaurants.  Hella's is the most popular, voted best of this and best of that, and I absolutely recommend their bakery.  But if you want really good food, cross the street to Dmitri's.  The lemon potatoes are almost as good as my homemade ( and before you say I'm full of myself, I married into a Greek family, there was a lot of trial and error and criticism until I got them perfect). The seafood pasta is delicious, the moussaka is great and something that's a pain in the butt for a home cook to make.  If your YiaYia tells you different she's lying because she loves you, watch she'll do the 3x spit after she says it when she thinks you're not looking‍. But beware when you order Greek salad in Tarpon, it's a normal and delicious Greek salad, but for people used to eating it elsewhere, the hidden scoop of potato salad under the rest is a little weird, but it's standard in Tarpon.  The saganaki is a showstopper as the flames are lit and ""Opa"" is yelled, grab your camera, but make sure to order the pita triangles as an extra or you'll be eating hot gooey cheese off a fork.  Aim to sit out on the back patio if you can, next to the dock, you might see the sponge tour coming or going.  Look for the super skinny diver swamped in the huge old sponge suit, and if the tourists are gone, puffing away on a cigarette, true authentic Greek island style.  Oh and be prepared to take home leftovers, this is Greek food, the portions are huge.",2021-01-17 18:32:47,355,1631,

The tables under the circle domes are very cool to look at. Nice string lights overhead, dim lighting throughout. Medium noise level - I could hear those sitting next to me fine but had to really speak up for the other side of the table to hear. Overall a great ambiance. 

Food was very farm-to-table esque. Lots of vegetarian options and options from different cuisines - sushi, tacos, etc. All the food was great tasting and had stunning plating. I got the cauliflower filet which was great, well cooked and seasoned and the avocado mash with it was yummy. Cocktails were well made, too. 

I did find the food a little odd for the atmosphere and a big pricey. It was all small plates and they were gorgeous but something about the environment felt more casual and the prices did not reflect that. My entree was $15 which seemed high for the ingredients - cauliflower, potatoes, avocado. Drinks were especially pricey - $13 for specialty cocktails, $10 for regular. 

Service was good, our server was really sweet and offered lots of suggestions on the food. I do wish someone would have told us up front that there was a time limit for seating so we didn't feel so rushed out at the end. Partially my own fault - I forgot that the OpenTable reservation DID specify a time limit but a gentle reminder at arrival would have helped us be more mindful of the time. 

Overall, I would recommend checking out Hangar! :)",2021-01-18 14:39:20,304,1508,

I now realize this was because we didn't need any refills on food. During second visit- we ordered the 3 entree option ( 2 adult females and 1 female teen.) Side portions were extremely small- in fact only 2 received servings of a couple sides. Immediately we asked for more of sides we finished( at this point we haven't even started eating just filling plate.) Server begins to ask what else we need ( nothing really as we haven't taken a bite just the 2 that ran out.) 20 or so minutes pass and our glasses were refilled I asked server for the sides. He proceeds to tell me, they are just like a normal restaurant and ticket was put in order. Finally we receive 1 of the 2 sides. 25 more minutes passes and no second side. I ask and he says kitchen is busy and he would tell a manger if I would like.  At this time we also said, well can we order our desserts now and just forget the side as we are finished with meal. Two minutes later our desserts arrived. I commented on how quick that process was and he said that was his job. A few minutes later manager came to table and proceeded to tell me how kitchen was slammed and how family style works. I offered her some suggestions; sides should be available for servers
To grab or start providing bigger portions so everyone at table is able to get some. She was unapologetic, matter of fact and to top it off wore her mask under her nose. Perhaps that is why many of the servers were incorrectly wearing masks. I did not ask for a comp but was credited for 1 person when the manager brought the check. I  stated this was not my intent I was just trying to help w process and explain why it is flawed. I don't normally post reviews, especially negative reviews on a new restaurant trying to survive in a pandemic however, my experiences were so different in 1 months time with the worse experience being the latter. After seeing other reviews written today about rude staff I felt it was important. Lastly, upon leaving and waiting for my party to use the restroom; 3 employees were having a conversation at the gift shop checkout( 2 with their masks off) about a customer. I tried to listen and thought perhaps my issue had filtered through the staff but I was unable to confirm- regardless it was unprofessional. I am hopefully upper management will read this and provide some additional training on many levels; customer service, speed of food refill process, and proper mask guidelines. If you are a light eater and don't require a refill- I am confident you will have a good experience.",2021-01-01 02:29:12,533,2642,

This was actually our second time here, after our very positive experience a few years ago on my birthday - that time our kids were taken on a tour of the kitchen and brought a board of mini desserts out for me with the help of our server. Our kid still have a great memory of that evening! 
Getting back to our recent visit, tables were spaced out and the staff was masked here. We ordered the calamari for appetizer and it was quite good. Our kids ordered Mocktails and really enjoyed them - one cocktail was lychee and raspberry mix and was something I would have loved as well. My Clementina(bit like a spicy margarita) was good but the Maestro was excellent - try it if you are looking for a twist on Old fashioned. 
I ordered the Wagyu for dinner and my husband had ordered the Feijoada. So far, our server was attentive and the food came out in appropriate amount of time. However as soon as I tried my Wagyu I was surprised that the steak was room temp - it wasn't warm, just room temp. It was very tasty though - perfectly cooked, buttery and melting in your mouth and the polenta was also barely warm but went well with the wagyu. I was bummed out that I wouldn't get the full experience of the food, and that too at that price. My husband loved his dish though. My kids enjoyed the kids standard fare. 
I mentioned the temperature issue to our server and she offered to bring a new plate out but I declined( didnt want to waste a good wagyu). Later on the manager came and apologized and offered to comp off our dessert - it was a kind gesture that we appreciated. We had the Flan for dessert and the Maldon salt on top adds a little extra to a usual flan. 
In short - food here is good, pricey yes but tasty. I hope they can be consistent with their quality of food.",2021-01-07 03:47:52,384,1840,

I've also viewed a few reports made with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) so consumers beware. On top of gouging people on their estimates, the owner Mark is the worst to deal with on any customer issues. He's extremely defensive and rude. He won't let the customer talk but proceeds to insult and lecture in an effort to defend his business. He seriously needs to learn better customer service. We had our BMW there twice. The first time it ended up being there for nearly 3 weeks, when we were initially told ""the part will be in tomorrow"", then a day to get the work done etc. Not to mention they had padded the work estimate with lots of labor hours which of course is where they make their money. Then the 2nd time, we had a minor issue with the emission control. This time we went out to 3 other foreign auto repair shops in our area, gave them the information on the code that was thrown from the cars computer, plus the part number for what needed to be replaced and we were shocked but not surprised. Automotion was literally 2 times the price of the other reputable shops so it confirmed what we had thought.....that their bids were way too padded on labor. For this emission control part replacement, the other 3 shops quoted exactly the same saying it was about a 1 hour job. Automotion said it was 4 hours plus. Do your homework and don't accept what this shop is telling you without getting other estimates to compare. I think you'll be surprised at how much money ""and effort"" you can save by not taking your car to Automotion!

Oh and since I wrote this review, Mark the owner has tried to rebut and defend by a long winded response. Don't buy it......these guys are a joke !! He even goes so far to call my husband the owner of the car......actually we both own it so that was pretty funny. Nice try Mark !!",2021-01-22 16:35:39,409,1943,

Most of the staff here are really helpful and knowledgeable, but it can get very busy, especially on holidays. We wanted to get some steaks on July 4th and we weren't going to make it on time before they closed, so I called to ask if they would make an exception if we would be just a couple minutes past, and the guy said ""Come on down!"" I thought that was good business, as he easily could have said ""No,"" and gone home. There was a line out the door on Christmas Eve, but they moved pretty fast and had a lot of guys working. Since COVID, they have implemented social distancing with markers on the floor and they limit capacity to 10 people in the store at a time. However, with that many people working behind the counter and no one really enforcing the limit, there were easily 25 bodies in there at once, which made me uncomfortable. You could easily avoid peak times if you needed to.

Wisconsin-based owner, I'm guessing with Packers gear all over the walls. They do sell cheese curds, and Midwesterners know their meats! They also have a deli counter for sandwiches and stuff, but I haven't gotten anything there. And I'm not sure anyone is really eating here anymore given the pandemic sitch. I know it's a butcher shop, but I must say the place doesn't really look the cleanest, but I've never had a problem.

Got there about 15 mins before 11 so was the first customer in the door. They were training some new staff but everyone behind the counter was super helpful, though as we know the masks make it hard to hear and to understand.

I really wanted to try the mofongo but being I was gonna be in the cockpit for 4 hrs after lunch I didn't want stinky breath so I went with the counter service lunch.

I got the red beans and rice, the pinto beans, roast pork and the beet/potato salad. The nice lady behind the counter said the chicken was most popular item on the menu but I'm a pork guy, she said she was a pork guy too. Haha. I'm not a big rice or bean eater but they were delicous. The pork was ok, it was a little dry, next time I'll get the chicken!

The standout item was the potato/beet salad. (I'm not sure which came first the beet or potato. I mean it was so good I was googling recipes for it a little bit ago. Russian salad? If Dee wants to drop the recipe in the comments, I'm from Indiana I won't compete from my home kitchen.) Did I say the Beet/Potato salad was good? Next time I want 3 scoops of that, pass on the rice and beans and try the chicken. 

A birdy behind the counter that was a pork loving bird told me the Cuban sammies are the best in Nashville. Being I had a couple of long flights to make with no time to get dinner I got two to go for myself and my co-pilot.

I threw them in the freezer at the airport until we took off then chucked them in the nose baggage to chill, planning on eating them when we got to Houston. We decided we weren't hungry yet and left them in the nose as we quick turned for Nashville. Of course, 20 minutes later we were both like, man I'm hungry now. Back in BNA after dark we put the plane away and heated them up in the nuke machine. They were pretty good. Wish we'd known there was chips and sauce in the bag. Being unpressurized at 45,000' it exploded everywhere, what was left was good. Speaking of sauce, the green hot sauce recommended at lunch was amazing, I put it on everything, really helped the pork a lot. 

Overall a nice experience. Clean. Friendly. Huge portions.

I did six rounds of Letrozole with timed intercourse at RMA. I am 36 and have an autoimmune disorder and wanted to start with something low-tech; I had one chemical pregnancy and no other success. This is not at all the practice's fault - it's all a game of chance. What the practice does have control over, however, is their ability to provide patient-centered care. I did not feel like an inividual with unique characteristics at this practice, but a number on a chart or a person in line. Nurses tried their best to answer questions promptly and with compassion, but I felt that the providers were pretty cold and applied protocols without much thought beyond the obvious. Again, this says more about the field than this particular practice, but I felt that some things could have been improved: instead of just giving people appt times, ask them to choose from a number of slots (I recognize that timing is everything, but so is delivery from medical staff to patients going through a potentially traumatic time in their lives); instead of assuming that a patient wants to continue to the next round, ask them; instead of sending ovidrel shots to an expensive pharmacy, ask the pt what they prefer. Basic patient-centered care. 

I stopped treatment after experiencing a pretty deep depression because of my lack of success (again, not RMA's fault but I do feel that the lack of personalization of care did contribute), and sought care with an accupuncturist who addressed my underlying autoimmune disease. My period regulated within three months and I'm now pregnant... I  later learned that accupuncture is sometimes offered part of RMA's IVF protocol but it was never suggested to me as an option that could work (most likely because it's cheaper...). 

I would never blame RMA for my lack of success getting pregnant at their facility, but my feedback regarding their level of patient care remains. Patient-centered care takes more time, but treating your patients like humans experiencing a difficult time is critical to their mental health and, perhaps, overall success.",2021-01-20 14:54:27,418,2205,

But as an adult I typically drink unsweetened tea, and this sweet tay may have given me three cavities with the first sip.

The cheesy bread seemed a little undercooked, but I think it was just the incredible buttery cheesy softness.

Chicken fried pork chop was tender enough to cut with a fork. Creamed potatoes were delicious but a little salty. Broccoli casserole was my favorite side. Mac and cheese was not my least favorite.  I like it creamy, but this one had a grainy feel to it. The tomato cucumber salad was almost straight vinegar and I loved it. 
Fried chicken was cooked perfectly,  and as tasty as i expected. 

Not a super fan of the service.  I arrived early, before they were busy, and had to wait about 5 minutes to order a drink.

Everyone in salon is super nice and it's very clean. I went in yesterday and got a full set and pedicure and heard the salon is under new ownership. I felt no different at all the new owners and staff are really nice and felt like a family like before. I came across nasty reviews here since new ownership took over it looks like and people need stop leaving and thrashing business this way. I'm sure the owner knew what she had in her mind since she was in business and ran a reputable salon for a long time in town. In a public related business can't always make everyone happy but you gotta realize there's always going to be one person who's unhappy and try to ruin reputation whether they're employee or customer. Holly was a really nice person and ran a a great business to most peoples opinion and what we saw. The new owners are really nice people and please stop thrashing talking and have some sense. No one can say how they can have their business ran to an owner or anyone else because they're unhappy with changes if that's the case then you need move on. This trash talking needs to stop. I was told that new owners said that they had their same crew for a long time and they wanted to bring their crew on board. Yes we're in a middle of pandemic and all but again it's what the owners want best for their business no one has a right to question that. The person trash talking on here saying all the wrong and nasty things advising you to reconsider your post and take it down. Life is not always what you want and there's no job security especially a lot of business suffering due to covid that they have to what they to do to keep doors open or if they have to turn it to a new owner it'a totally their right and no one can anything. Whoever is thrash talking when you have your own business someday you can run it the way you want someday buy you can't trash talk because hollie decided to accept and offer and turn her salon to new owners it's her own decision and I'm sure she wouldn't just let go of her staff that she had for the time being just like that. Staff told me that Hollie gave everyone an extra money due to covid and did everything she could so now why is she being trashed and also not giving peace and right for the new owners to run their business in peace. Far the best salon in Williamstown will continue to go there and allow them to earn my business please support the new owners and not believe the lies of trash talking people here especially it's all lies. Happy Nails new owners congrats and good luck. Hollie and her staff wishing you all good luck in your future decisions love and miss you all except Ari and her mom because can't believe they're trash talking and trying to reputation like this!!!!,2021-01-03 23:12:23,602,2933,

This last visit was with a gift certificate (kind of - Sweet Deals $50 gift certificate for $25). I'm always up for a good bloody mary so I ordered the sloppy hog - their version of a bloody mary. I asked for the spicy version. I'm not a fan of their homemade bloody mary mix. It's chunky. I think there were bits of bacon in it. But I'm not sure. I just know that there were more sips than not that were so off-putting because of unexpected bits of something. 
The first time we were there I tried the Prime Steak Sandwich with sweet potato tots. Loved the tots. The sandwich was good but there was way too much fat. Unfortunately I felt like I was spitting out inedible fat with every bite.
This last visit they had Lobster Morney on the menu. I ordered that and the waitress let me know the lobster was served cold. When I changed my order she said she'd had a lot of complaints because the cold lobster so I was letting people know. How about letting the cooks and management know??
So I got the Baja Scramble with house fries and a fruit cup. The egg scramble was fine. Honestly it was a big mix of a lot of flavors. Nothing great. The potatoes took up more than half of the huge plate = ALOT of potatoes.
The home fries were great for the first few bites. And then there were a lot of very burnt bits and then undercooked slices. Some had a lot of seasoning and some that had none. The fresh fruit bowl was very good and flavorful. 
Hubby got Chicken Fried Steak. He said it was fine. He also got the home fries and his portion was a bit smaller but the same issues as mine.
They have some cool big drinks that would be fun with friends, but I'm just not impressed with the food. Maybe after a couple of their big drinks I'd check out the appetizers. Seems like they have a good happy hour menu.",2021-01-11 04:38:09,403,1838,

There was an exceptionally rude woman working there with a long braid and green scrubs. I had to go there today because my cat was bleeding from his mouth and I didn't know why. 

I got there and realized I needed to call prior to entering. This is normal in our society now but when I called, I let them know my cat was bleeding and I didn't know why. She asked me what color my car was. I said ""I'm right in front of your door, please come get my cat.""  She asked me in a very snide manner what color my car was. Really? I just told you Im right in front and my cat is bleeding. She asked again with an even more disgusted tone 'What color is your car, ma'am?' 

At this point I realized she cared less about the condition of my cat and more about how she was going to exert her control over the situation. I told her it was grey and she finally came out. 

She took my cat without asking his name or what I thought the problem was. She gave me something to fill out and walked away. 

When she came back she said I didn't fill out the paperwork correctly and the doctor wouldn't see my cat until I did. At this point I made a comment to her that I'm was really glad my cat wasn't suffering life threatening symptoms because he'd probably be dead by now. She promptly responded with, 'There are other animals with more serious problems than yours!' 

I immediately asked for my cat back. That was the fastest I saw her move in this entire scenario.

Simply heartless and unprofessional. No compassion towards the stress I was under. No care shown for the condition of my pet. No reassuring kind words of the care they intended to give my cat. And she couldn't get rid of him fast enough when I asked for him back.

Despite the vastness of the establishment and the many open seats , a rather curt hostess rejected our offer for entry and instead offered us a spot on the 90 minute wait list. We gave our information  and dejected made our way toward the stadium that sat behind the bar. The brilliant Nashville sun shined towards the west as we meandered down the road and stumbled upon an oasis known as ""third and home""

Unlike the rebuke from the van Elrods staff the hostess at third and home made you feel as their name suggests that you are ""home"". The modern sports bar sits on the second floor of an office building. A long and clean bar resides on the far side of the second floor and is surrounded by large glass windows that allow the patrons to look out and take in Nashville's finest double A baseball. An outdoor patio provides even more direct access for fans of the boys of summer. The inside of the bar has plenty of tables, a few large booths, and a mix of high and low rise spots. Our server was gracious and the restaurant well was well staffed. Large and modern tVs broadcasted the days most popular sporting events. Both appetizers were tasty. I recommend the tater tots. Hot, fresh, and loaded is the way to go. Shrimp cocktail would have made you assume there was freshwater just beyond the horizon of the Beautiful baseball diamond. Beer was ice cold and refills prompt. Friendly service. Couldn't be a better place to stop before a base ball game or to watch a game , in my humble opinion.

There was one outside table that was only occupied by used dishes. I said I would wait for it. The hostess said she couldn't sit me out there because the waiter didn't want any more tables.

They are offering dine-in again, and from what my partner and I could tell, it's a fairly decent-sized restaurant. However, we opted to order to-go, which the hostess was extremely helpful with. 

My partner and I went on a Tuesday afternoon, and were pleasantly surprised to find out that they offered both daily lunch and weekday specials. I went for the pork rib lunch special, which came with three pork ribs, two sides, cornbread, and a drink. For my sides, I chose their ""dirty rice"" and mac n cheese, with sweet tea as my drink. My partner opted for the weekday special, which was tri-tip, offered as a melt, platter, or sandwich during lunch; he chose the melt option. As a special side treat, I had also ordered us their pecan cinnamon bun to share. 

We waited outside the restaurant as we had ordered to-go, and our food took less than 20 minutes to come out! So, to break down how everything tasted:

Tri-tip melt: SO good. Very tender meat, nicely toasted bread (not sure what kind of bread it came on, but I believe it was sourdough)
Pork ribs: Also very good. I prefer a dry rib over a saucy one, and their ribs definitely had some good flavor, but not as tender meat as the tri-tip

Dirty rice: my partner actually ate all of it so unfortunately no comments for this one

Mac n cheese: gooey cheese sauce, but overall not as remarkable as I had hoped. Definitely needed some additional seasoning instead of just a few breadcrumbs that were thrown on top

Cornbread: nothing too different with their cornbread, either--just that it had a cake-like texture as opposed to others that make it very crumbly

Pecan cinnamon bun: Arguably the second best thing from our whole meal, right after the tri-tip melt. We had actually eaten it the day after we went to BJ's NV Barbeque, and a minute or so in our microwave allowed us to enjoy it's wonderful smell and taste immediately. I liked that the pecans were chopped small, and the sauce they use was just amazing. You'll definitely want to order one for you and someone else (or just you) to share.

Overall, a pretty good barbeque place! I'd love to come back and try their brisket next, as well as the tempting varieties of fries they offer.",2021-01-11 02:14:16,482,2297,

The good things are that there is a nice big room to get your nails done and they offer you a cold bottle water of water upon seating you . It is quite spacious and appears to be clean . 
The bad things are that There are MULTIPLE ppl working here but hardly customers and There are no protocols when it comes to social distancing upon paying out when you're done . 
Not okay . You have staff ppl sitting there shouting to their boss when you walk up that they don't know how to take payment from the customers and it takes about two hours for the entire situation to take place from start to finish. 
The vibe is amateurish . The ppl working are straight out of beauty school which it obvious by their technique since they don't pumice feet . They remind you that it's normally busy and that walk ins are unheard of which was something that kept striking me as odd . I kept wondering Why would it would even matter ... Totally odd . The vibes are off in this place . Seems the owners take FULL advantage of the employees here since they have them work 10 hour shifts here during COVID . Yikes .

Side note: I understand with covid, things are very weird right now and restaurants are doing their best. However, when I read a review describing the exact scenario we experienced PRE covid, I felt compelled to provide our first time encounter. 

We arrived around 1100 and were told a 20 minute wait: a reasonable frame of time due to the area's dense population and love of brunch. After waiting 25-30 mins, while watching many people come and go, we asked where we were on the waiting list. We were told not to worry about 20 minutes. Another 20 minutes?! After watching many people leave. We ditched our efforts to go to another restaurant. We were seated and had our orders placed before I received the text that our table was ready - nearly an hour!! I get it, it's not always easy to gauge wait times. But do not piss on my head and tell me it's raining. 20 minute wait times compared to 60 minutes is vastly different. 

I'm disappointed as I've heard good things about the food. Please do a better job with providing honest wait times. It truly looked as if people who requested through the app (something I didn't know) were being sat before people that came in and put their names on a list. Also - we would've been completely fine to wait an hour as we could've gone shopping nearby in the meantime. Being told 20 minutes two separate times was insulting.",2021-01-17 22:45:14,304,1446,
VYQZSTRmmsVcc33QENSFwA,QGMX1H6WQTp-o8Qq3uO3dQ,bzjOYERJv5YwW6Q8lUBcJw,5,5,2,2,"I can review Costco on Yelp!?  

Why yes I can! And I should because it's about the only place this particular recently- turned sexagenarian Yelper goes in these days of COVID19.

Sexagenarians--and if you're thinking clubs or dating services, reach for the dictionary, please--get their own early shopping hour on weekdays.  (Septo-, octo-, nano-genarian, and centenarians are also welcome in the Early Shopping Times, currently 09:00-10:00).   

A review of Costco, in theory, would rate this particular store (New Orleans) against other Costcos around the world.  To that point, I have been in numerous stores in the United States and Canada and I find Costco impressively consistent among locations.  

Given that, the most useful point of a Yelp review is whether the membership is worth it . In smaller households some products, particularly perishables, can spoil before fully consumed.  That happens occasionally to us with a less popular vegetable, but even with a household of three that's rare.   We stick with organic ultra-pasteurized milk with an expiry usually 2-3 months away.  Other products, like the tubs'o'-dip or the four pounds of butter cookies, are anticipated to last a month or two but are in fact consumed within days.  Woe to those trying to practice ""portion contr..""--actually, I can't in good conscience complete that phrase when it shares a paragraph with ""Costco"".   You will, at some point, eat 800 potato chips, still have 2/3 of the bag left, and then hear about it from your bathroom scale.

This New Orleans Costco is like the others with a notable exception: as a concession to its location in a lower income area, the hot dog and pizza cafe is located outside and does not require membership; as a concession to being in Louisiana, the liquor is in the store between the light bulbs and produce cooler.  (They will ID if your purchase includes alcohol, even if you're a sexagenarian).  

Here are the advantages I see for membership, first in general, and then what's in it for the ""executive member""  at the $110 level:

** Costco has uniformly courteous and well-trained employees in every department.  They're a pleasure to deal with, and how often can you say that about customer service these days?

** Auto service is tires and batteries:  Battery selection is severely limited (owners of Honda Fits and those 7th gen CIvics with the reverse polarity batteries, no battery for you). Tires are competitively priced and specials on the two manufacturers, Bridgestone and Michelin, are offered on an alternating basis.  Don't expect to put on a different size tire than OEM (e.g.,  you can't substitute 205/50-16 for the a 185/55-16 as some other shops allow).  Balancing and mounting have been problem free for me, and they will do rotation and balance as part of the extended service.  Costco uses torque-controlled extensions on their wrenches to prevent over-torquing that many shops cause when they apply an air-wrench.   Not a big deal until you return from 9000 miles through Death Valley and Southwest to find a stripped lug nut, as happened from another shop. 

** Costco tends toward high-quality items with slightly less variety Sam's Club.  For cat food, Costco offers 3-4 varieties with only one wet-food choice where Sam's carries 6 or so with multiple wet-food options (cat owners know why this matters).  

** Almost everything I've purchased from Costco has been high quality, sometimes luxury brands show up in goofy-huge packages.  At one point, they offered a bottle of scotch for $38 grand.  Manager told me they sold two (!).  

** The loss-leading perfectly seasoned  whole chicken for five bucks is one of the best deals around. 

** Produce is fresh, and while you're trying to assuage the guilt of overdoing the butter cookies, have some fruit or fix a salad from the giant pack of spinach you brought home.   Under this strategy, you can use Costco's large quantities per item (sometimes laughably huge) to your advantage.  (At least that's what I tell myself when I'm munching on a butter cookie staring at the pile of produce I need to figure out how to fit in the fridge. )

** Some products are sold in bundles of smaller sealed packages.  Bagels and bread, for example, are generally two-packs and one can be frozen.

** The premium membership kicks back 2% redeemable annually for cash or Costco store credit.  If you spend more than a couple grand at Costco per year, the executive level pays for itself.

** Costco switched affiliation from American Express to VISA a few years back, and they offer a VISA card with 4% on gas (already cheap at Costco, but good for any fuel purchase), 3% on groceries, restaurants and travel, 2% on other Costco purchases, and 1% on everything else.  

COVID19:

Costco enforces mask-wearing and social distancing pretty well.  It does get crowded, tho, I suggest finding less busy times if you're too young for the old-timers' (you know, sexagenarian!) hours.",2021-01-01 02:02:47,989,4971,

Pre-COVID, my hubby and I were making a trip through TN to enjoy a long weekend vacay from NC. After watching a few food shows on Netflix and talking about it with foodie coworkers on our #food slack channels, I'd heard about Nashville hot chicken. It seemed like it was especially unique to the area and so we made a trip to see what it was about. There was a little bit of a line when we pulled up. Not so surprisingly, we expected it to be busy given its reputation. So we admired the chicken painted decor outside while we waited. When we finally got inside, it took a minute to digest the menu, and figure out what we wanted to eat. When we found the hot chicken sandwiches on the menu, it was time to also decide what heat level we wanted. The way the heat levels were broken out made me giggle from ""Southern"" no heat, ""Mild"" touch of heat, ""Hot!"" feel the heat, ""Medium"" warming up, ""Damn Hot!! Firestarter or my fave ""Shut the Cluck Up!!!"" burn notice. Given we were far away from home and had taken pups who were waiting for us back at our hotel for us, I didn't commit to trying the ""shut the cluck up"" spice level in case my tummy had a bad reaction to it and opted for the next hottest instead with Damn Hot. I'd tried extreme spicy food challenges in the past and over time I began to develop gut issues from it so I felt compelled to take it easy this time around. It was delicious and still had a lot of heat to it! Not to mention, when I shared my experience on insta, the folks who manage their social media accounts were very engaged and supportive of the level of enthusiasm we shared with friends commenting on our experience. We literally swung through town with the number one intent of trying hot chicken, so it was a very notable gesture for us and meant a lot that they cared to hear how their fans felt about their experience with them. Would definitely recommend this place!",2021-01-18 01:43:34,451,2113,

I really miss Ferraro's which technically was  Jersey style, but very similar - although Ferraro's did seem to go downhill the last couple of years it was around. I tried Pizza Head based on  good reviews, many of which compared it favorably with really good New York style pizza. This pizza was pretty good, but not quite as good as others I've had. It definitely paled compared to Ferraro's or Talayna's at their peak. First off, and as my picture shows, the cheese was almost non-existent. Normally I wouldn't order just a cheese pizza, but since they only have plant based meat substitutes, I was fine with a cheese pizza. Seriously, if cheese is the only topping, at least put some on. The second issue for me was the crust was chewy with no crunch. Maybe a few extra minutes in the oven would have done the trick. I ate two pieces as soon as I got it because wanted to try it hot. When I got home 20 minutes or so later, I warmed it up for my wife and daughter in the oven, and that helped a lot. If I could, I would give this 3 1/2 stars - I didn't want to go as low as 3, but I think 4 is too high. With a little more cheese, and crunch, it could have truly earned 4 stars.

We originally had plans to dine in, but decided to order take out instead. Due to capacity restrictions due to COVID-19, reservations are required. You can easily make reservations by calling the restaurant the day you want to eat (they open at 6:30am). 
We ordered The Feast which includes BBQ chicken, beef brisket, and pork ribs. It includes two sides - we ordered coleslaw and chili (chili is an extra $1) and cornbread (4 squares). You can order the sauce mild, medium, or spicy so we ordered mild. It is designed to feed 3-4 people or 1-2 with leftovers in our experience. The chicken was not dry, but I would have liked more of a grilled flavor to accompany the BBQ sauce flavor. The brisket was my favorite...tender, full of flavor, and the BBQ sauce complimented it perfectly. The ribs were tender, fell off the bone, and had both a dry rub flavor as well as the sauce flavor. The coleslaw was pretty standard, but tasty. The chili was very good with a bit of a kick to it! We opted for just cheese and onion on top, but it also comes with jalapenos. The cornbread was a bit dry for my taste, but had a nice flavor. The brisket paired well with it for a mini sandwich. 
I ordered a few minutes before 5:00pm and they said the order would be ready by 5:25pm. The order was ready on time, and the food was hot and fresh. When I went to pick up the food, the restaurant was very busy. All the staff I interacted with were very nice and pleasant.

I felt like I barely retained any information because it was overwhelming how quickly we were moving/talking. The tour guide did stop to offer to answer any questions we might have at the end then we were surprised with a free wine tasting. I wish they would give a lil information about all the building surrounding the house while they give u an overview on the front porch. 

Here's some Google history information I found: 
Seabiscuit, Secretariat, Bonnie Scotland, Enquirer, Barbarro, and American Pharaoh can all trace their blood lines back to the Belle Meade Plantation, as well as every horse to race in the Kentucky Derby since 2003. 
In 1807, Virginian John Harding purchased a log cabin + 250 acres where he boarded horses for neighbors (one was Andrew Jackson), bred thoroughbreds, and was active in horse racing with the help of his son William Giles Harding, who became one of the most successful horse racers/breeders in America. 
During the Civil War, Confederate General James Chalmers used Belle Meade as his headquarters during the Battle of Nashville. On December 15, 1864, there was a battle fought  about a mile away at the family's racetrack. After emancipation, of the 136 enslaved people, 72 chose to stay and work for pay at Belle Meade. They had to sign a contract of ""18 Rules & Regulations."" After the war, Belle Meade became a nationally renowned thoroughbred farm and showplace for high-quality livestock.  In 1881, one of their horses Iroquois was the 1st American-bred Thoroughbred to win the Epsom Derby in England. 
Eventually, baseball caused horse racing to no longer be the top American sport. Also, the temperance movement against gambling, drinking, and smoking hurt the sport. With financial instabilities, Belle Meade was eventually sold in 1906. In 1953, Tennessee bought the Mansion and its 8 outbuildings on the property to ensure its preservation.",2021-01-30 17:44:58,468,2392,

They have ample parking over there as well.  Outside of that there is not much to it. The soccer goals and small bleachers have definitely seen better days. 

The other side of the street is a bit bigger and that is where you will find baseball/softball fields, a playground, hiking/biking trails, picnic table pavilion and recycling receptacles. There is more than enough parking on this side of the park, at least for regular use.  Not sure how parking would work for a large event such as a baseball tournament though.

The baseball fields, which are home to Decatur Central Baseball, just like the soccer fields, these fields are in need of some upgrades and serious TLC. You must get a permit prior to using the fields.  The playground is decent. It has a large tower with slides, the traditional swings, rock climbing and other playground equipment.  There is also benches nearby to sit and watch the kiddos play.

They trails are awesome.  They are clearly marked and good in all types of weather.  I was there with snow on the ground and people were fat tire bike riding, walking their 4-legged friend and hiking. The trails are color coded and are marked by colored posts.

The pavilion is covered, has a couple of grills and a few picnic tables.  It is right off of the baseball fields.

In the back of the park, they have large receptacles for cardboard, newspaper and glass. It is not for trash or any other dumping.

This is a nice wide open park that is easily accessible, family friendly and can be peaceful if you can make it away from the street. You can hike, mountain bike, hang out with your furry friend, picnic, play frisbee, play soccer or hit a couple of balls.",2021-01-28 15:31:00,362,1792,

I knew going in that my youngest son, 4, had some issues with his teeth.  Everyone was friendly. The office was nice. My boys said the woman doing the x-rays wasn't friendly, but they were only with her for a few minutes. The cleaning was fine as far as I know.  Now for why I would never go back.  The dentist said my youngest needed at least one baby root canal leading to a silver tooth and/or a tooth pulled requiring spacers. She wanted him to go to a surgical center where they would most likely fill multiple (7 or 8) cavities with silver fillings.  She couldn't guarantee they'd use the white fillings. I was VERY upset imagining his mouth full of silver especially because we are very big into dental care at home. She just kind of told me there are no other options.

She also prescribed my 9 year old toothpaste that was $30/tube. This kid's dentist appointment pre-Covid was glowing, so I was surprised that she felt he needed special toothpaste.

They gave me an estimate on all services and WITH insurance it was about $2500.  I was on the verge of tears. At the urging of friends, I went to a pediatric dentist in our area that is very well-known and has been practicing for 20+ years for a 2nd opinion. Wow! My son did need his tooth pulled, but no spacer and no silver whatsoever in his little mouth. She also told me to skip the $$$ toothpaste for my other son and to just allow my son's regular toothpaste to sit on his teeth for a few minutes. They both DID have cavities filled with white. Our total was around $700 for BOTH boys.  If you can, I'd skip Children's Dental Health. I had heard about places doing this to get money and I think CDH may be one of those places :/",2021-01-05 18:53:27,374,1747,

1.  Making Appointments - this is a nightmare.  To get an appointment, you have to call right at 7:30AM and sit on hold for at least 20 minutes to get an appointment for that day.  This was true even pre-COVID and is still true now.  They even had a ridiculous rule that you couldn't schedule an appointment for the following day and you had to call bright and early (7AM pre-COVID, 7:30 post-COVID) to get in for a sick visit.

2.  The appointment itself - Make sure to leave plenty of time.  For both sick and well visits, you will wait for at least 1 hour back in the room.  They never run on time so make sure you allow a minimum of 1.5 hours for a visit.  One of the doctors is notorious for running 2 hours behind.  I would avoid her at all costs.

3.  Telemedicine is a joke - When you schedule an appointment and ask if telemedicine is an option, they will ask your symptoms.  Then, if THEY determine telemedicine is appropriate, they will schedule you for an appointment.  However, after you sit on hold for your appointment for 30+ minutes waiting for the doctor, don't be surprised to get a phone call telling you that you have to come in person.  If this happens, do not expect anyone to work you in or any doctor to help out for their mistake.  These people do not care.

4.  Getting forms - This takes 7 days.

This practice is too large.  They want you to think they are the only game in town, but they are not.  In fact, all of my other family members (4 other families) have also left this practice for the reasons above.  Mainly, no one there cares about your time.  If you have a new baby, bring formula or be ready to nurse because you will be there for hours waiting for a doctor.  My advice to save you from suffering and keeping your children from suffering is to go to a different practice.  If you do choose to go with this practice, you will eventually change your mind because it has been this way forever.",2021-01-27 21:45:51,447,2104,

We sat in the church, which is, to say the least, breathtaking. They had a live harpist playing which was beautiful. Quite loud inside as the massive structure reverberates sound. The service was unfortunately sub-par for how pricy the dining experience is though, and our particular server was not the most personable or forthcoming with menu recommendations. When asked about an off-menu espresso martini or alcoholic coffee beverage, he told us there was only one bartender for the entire restaurant so they absolutely would not be doing that because they didn't have time. 

The drinks we did get were tasty: Mexican firing squad (spicy fresh play on a margarita), Juliet and Romeo (my favorite-light, tart, and refreshing), widow's kiss (very strong-didn't love it), boulevardier (also very strong-my husband didn't love it), holy mimosa (expensive for basically a standard mimosa).

For food: we started with the giardiniera picked vegetables (nice crispy pickle veggies), whipped ricotta (not as rich as I'd hoped, but the ""sourdough"" pancake it came with to eat on was quite tasty). And the for entree we got the fried Brussel sprouts (deliciously lightly sweet and crispy) and Wagyu chuck filet (very tasty and cooked perfectly medium).

Overall, we are so glad we went because it really is a beautiful place-that helped make up for lack of service and overpriced somewhat mediocre food. We will likely go back, but not in any rush, and will be just for drinks and to see the venue in the future.",2021-01-31 15:18:03,329,1631,

They never disappoint, and we always know it will surprise us and be fantastic. Our visit tonight (our 2nd inside dining during COVID -- we felt safe and saw that they were very conscientious about it) was as amazing as it always is! My advice to others is -- TRUST THE CHEFS!! Their Tasting Menu is a great value, and you do them and you a favor by leaving it to them -- don't fuss with it and hem and haw over decisions that probably don't go together anyway, just say ""I'd like the tasting menu and please leave it to the chef."" That's what we have always done here, and it's what you get at The French Laundry and La Bernadin -- do YOU want to tell Thomas Keller or Eric Ripert ""can I have this instead and substitute this for the other?"" -- NO! This is not to suggest Acero is either of those, but hopefully you get my point. Leave it to the professionals to serve you a great meal that relies on their knowledge of how they built their menu and what they know about what follows what. It makes it easy on the kitchen and easy on the server. We even left the wine to them -- we didn't know what we were having, so just bring us a red and a white. They brought us their most interesting of each, which we might have never picked and enjoyed them immensely. Our meal was amazing, and included all of the specials plus the things that were nice complements or counterparts to them (in the sense that we would switch plates halfway through, maybe a bit gauche, but who cares), and we loved every dish. We asked to sub out the dessert for a cheese course, and could not have been happier! I highly recommend it (and they should probably include that as an option, so much more Italian/European than sweets). This is now VERY long and if you're reading this far thanks for hanging in there. Acero is one of the best, underexposed, and under appreciated restaurants in STL. But please take my advice and let the professionals do what they do best and step out of the way (good advice for any restaurant) -- we have done this every time we've been there and have always had an amazing experience.

As other reviewers have written, Melissa and her bee-themed beauty studio Maebee's are TOP NOTCH, a true gem. I have been going to see Melissa for bikini and brow waxing for about two years. I first decided to make an appointment because of the stellar reviews and because her previous Kensington location was walking distance from my house. Although she has since moved, I would not think of going anywhere else at this point because Melissa really is the ""bee's knees"" (sorry, I had to). 

Melissa is professional, personable and fun to talk to, which makes the experience of someone peering up your downside far less awkward. She is also just very good at waxing: very little pain/redness and absolutely smooth. She checks in during the entire process to make sure that you are comfortable. I am not over-selling when I tell you that she has consistently given me the best waxes I have ever had. She will also make sure that the wax is aesthetically perfect: even on both sides, every stray hair gone and every rogue one put back in its place. She is meticulously clean and careful, which I appreciate immeasurably during COVID times. 

The prices are lower than or comparable to other Philly beauty studios that I've frequented. I should mention that I also always request ""a la carte"" additions to my waxes, so that they are somewhere in-between bikini/full Brazilians. In the spirit of avoiding the exhaustive pricing list many other salons utilize, Melissa has never once up-charged me for my hybrid bush-- and she definitely could.

I don't often write reviews but Melissa really is an all-star who cares so much about her clients. I happened to be the only scheduled appointment today and Melissa opened up the studio and came in anyway. That is dedication! The past ten months have been particularly hard on small businesses, and I am very glad that Maebee's has persevered. Besides Melissa's tenacity, I imagine that this is also because many, many other people feel the same way that I do: Maebee's is where it's at!

If you need a wax (or facial/make-up once COVID restrictions relax), do yourself a favor and come to this place!!",2021-01-26 22:52:06,428,2165,

On Jan 2nd my fiance and I went to Elder Ford looking for a new vehicle. After walking the lot for close to hour half, we ended up going inside and asking for someone to assist us. We ended up with Tony, salesperson, but he kept telling us how busy they were and how they didn't have time to give us personalized service... Whatever.

The experience went down hill FAST with Melvin. He proceeded to ask us about our personal financial information IN A HALLWAY, when his office was just feet away. Totally unprofessional. We had some minor miscommunications and he laughed at my answers.. again, in a hallway.

He told us their system was down so he would need to email me some documents, I said fine. Days pass and nothing. I finally get a call from someone asking me to leave a review. I bring up how I still haven't received the documents, I was told they would be emailed to me and to wait to leave the review until I got the documents because they don't want upset customers to leave reviews.

A day, maybe two, pass and I finally get an email from Melvin (Jan 7) with the documents. NO WHERE in the email does it say to sign the documents and return to him. Verbatim the email says: ""Please see important documents regarding your 2020 GMC Terrain attached to this email. We appreciate your business.""
A few days later, I start getting multiple calls pressuring me to sign those documents and get them back.. when they were the ones who were delayed on sending them to me in the first place!! They also called my fiance looking for me after I didn't answer one of their calls while I was working, during standard 9-5 office hours. (Disgusting!!)
I emailed the documents on the morning of Jan 13 to Melvin and got NO response or confirmation of receipt.

I still have not heard anything from this company (it is Jan 20). I regret ever giving Elder Ford my business.

If you do decide to purchase a car here and they try to give you Melvin as a finance manager, ask for someone else to assist you.",2021-01-23 13:33:57,430,2054,

Upon the first bite of this by my fifteen-year-old daughter she quickly commented,""Wow. That bread SLAPS"". It did. Slap. It was so delicious and as I do love naan (which is all I know to compare it to).. it was softer, richer and tasted like they had just baked it fresh from the oven (baked? Fried? Grilled? Whatever. DELICIOUS) My dish was filled with aromatic spices and I ordered it with chicken that was juicy and delicious. My kid loved her tikka masala also with chicken and we both enjoyed the Gobi (cauliflower and other vegetables marinated with ginger, garlic, turmeric, coriander spices and herbs and dusted with flour, then deep fried). SO good. We gobbled our food down that was served with two generous portions of rice. Caviar delivered within 30 minutes and the delicious food was delivered hot and fresh.

My wife and I are in Arizona two weeks for Christmas.  A week ago, Saturday, December 26th  we stopped by to order two pizzas to go, Green & Cheesy (add Sundried tomatoes) and Pancetta & Brie.  Upon getting home we immediately put the Green & Cheesy in a large chest freezer and ate the 
Pancetta & Brie. In the evening two days later (Monday Dec. 28th) , we took the Green & Cheesy out of the freezer,, warmed it in the microwave, and ate it. A few hours later, upon going to bed, we both felt sick. We then spend the next 12 hours with violent vomiting and diarrhea.  We were both in bed all the next day, couldn't even keep water down.  I'm still not feeling totally back to normal. There is no question that it was the pizza. There was absolutely nothing either of us ate or drank prior to getting sick that was in common between us except the pizza.  Only the pizza!  
 
I realize I should have contacted you and the Pima County Health department sooner but you don't feel like doing much with your head in the toilet. And, there was only some crust left in the box so I'm not sure what testing would have shown at that point. I know how this works.  I wouldn't expect you to admit or accept blame or admit to any other reports, but you need to know that this incident occurred.  Hopefully you will re-double your efforts to assure safe ingredients in the future.  We of course won't be returning.  

One final issue. While we were sitting in the dining room waiting for the pizza's, we noticed a fairly large guy working to our left behind the prep area that wasn't wearing a mask. Well, to be more exact, he had a mask on covering his chin, but both mouth and nose were uncovered as he was talking to the girl next to him. That didn't make us feel very comfortable from a Corona virus point of view as he was preparing food.",2021-01-03 18:00:00,398,1845,

American Revolution (1775-83): Jackson at 13 years old served as an orderly. He and his brother became POW. After he refused to clean an officer's boots, the officer slashed him with a sword, scarring his forehead and left hand. Jackson was the only member of his family to survive the war. 
TN Statehood: After earning his law license, he moved to what would eventually turn into Tennessee. There's a suggestion he named the new state: Tennessee, from the name of a Cherokee Indian chief. It came into the Union as the 16th state. 
War of 1812 (1812-15): Jackson had achieved the rank of major general of the Tennessee militia. He's known for the Battle of Horseshoe Bend and the Battle of New Orleans. 
POTUS: His running for presidency, split the Democratic-Republican Party in two. Jackson's opponents nicknamed him ""jackass,"" which caused Jackson to use the symbol of a donkey to represent the new Democratic Party.
He wanted to abolish the Electoral College, to give the power to the people which gave him the nickname the ""people's president.""

This wasn't our top pick for Christmas Dinner but it was one of the only places that had reservations left so we took it.  Upon arrival we were seated quickly.  But being that it was Christmas, they were WAY under staffed. We waited long periods in between to get service.  But since it was Christmas, it didn't bother us because we were thankful this place was open at all.

To start we ordered our usual cocktails.  I was in the mood for Sangria and my husband was in the mood for a Martini.  Both came out and were good.  

For an appetizer we ordered the Jumbo Lump Crab-cake *didn't come out until way later*.

For the entrees, I ordered their Christmas Prime Rib special and my husband ordered the Filet Duo.  These entries came out SUPER fast.  My husband said his filet's were good but they weren't hot.  We feel like maybe they were precooked and placed on a warming dish and as it was ordered, they were plated and brought out (probably due to being under staffed).  But once again, not going to complain since it was Christmas.  

Our appetizer never came out though, our waiter finally realized it and apologized.  He asked us if we still wanted it, to which we said yes.  Glad we kept it because it was REALLY good.  There were whole pieces of crab in it and you can taste the quality.  

The Truffle Mac & Cheese side was TOO DIE FOR! Truffle makes everything 100% better and this was no different.  It's a game changer.

The location it's small and quaint which otherwise I would love but due to social distancing measures made for a bit of discomfort but you could tell the team really try their best by blocking off every other table and having marks where people could stand.

we went during a breakfast time (930)  so it was fairly busy and the team did a very good job I've going through all the orders efficiently. It may have looked as if they were still setting up and stocking but they did the best they could.

We ordered two of their egg sandwiches a chai and a mocha latte. The egg sandwiches were very good and the mocha was as well unfortunately the chai although it was supposed to be hot with serve almost cold even though it came out shortly after the mocha which was very hot. The chai flavor itself was not my cup of tea it tasted fairly water down with barely any flavor, so it seems maybe it was made wrong and left out? Not sure. 

We asked for a drink holder as we ordered another drink at that point and got an orange juice from the fridge and while they did provide one which is fantastic it was put together when it was given to us. When we put in the drinks the bottom fell out right away spilling half of our coffee's all over the place. So I definitely would not recommend their carriers I don't believe it was built wrong I just believe they were unfortunately poor quality

You start by choosing your top scents from the candle wall- there are probably over 100 options to choose from! Then you choose whichever candle holder you want to use for your creation. Your price is based on the size and type of container you pick. You then get seated and the associates help you pick some potential options that may go well together based on your selections. They will let you test again as many flavor combos as you want so you don't feel rushed or pressured to choose your final combination. You then get to add the scents in your preferred ratio, mix with wax, and ta-da, you have your own custom candle. Also it's fun they let you create a fun name for your candle as well! You have to let the candle sit for 2 hours before you can take it home but you can come back anytime within the next 2 weeks for pickup. 

I've been here twice and my 2nd experience was not as great- we were seated after choosing our scents and candle holders and waited almost 10 minutes before I finally asked what we had to do next- apparently no one was assigned to us so we were just sitting there awkwardly waiting. Once I asked, we were helped immediately and our helper was so kind- I wish I remembered her name! Also- when I flipped my candle over to read my name on the bottom of my 2nd candle, my candle fell out! I'm not sure what went wrong but it seems to be too lose for the holder.

I purchased my 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland with a CPO warranty from Courtesy. I have sent (and they have purchased) 5 other parties for vehicles over the past 3 years. A quick rundown...within the 1st 6 months of my car ownership; the remote start went out. The service department attempted to charge me over $300 for repair; which incensed me because I'd not had the CPO inspected vehicle that long. I wrote a review and the Service manager offered to discount the repair to $100 as long as I updated the review. I honored his request; only to find out that the repair should've been covered under CPO for the $100 deductible FROM THE BEGINNING! 
2020 arrives and I lose my very well paying job.I take my vehicle to Courtesy for an oil change and upon inspection; they find one of the gaskets may be leaking and, of course; a much needed tune up. The total they quote is close to 2500 for repairs! I am unable to honor so I just get the tune up, oil change and some minor repairs for about 749. Shortly thereafter, my vehicle begins making a ""ticking"" noise, I take it to a local mechanic who tells me of a known issue with engine rockers and tells me to take it to Courtesy. I take it to Courtesy; they agree that there is an issue; take my VIN number to access my records; and advise me that I would have an almost 4500 repair! The two techs specifically tell me the problem is NOT COVERED. A friend suggests I get a 2nd opinion so I take my vehicle to another local Jeep dealership. They access my vehicle records; and without a 2nd thought tell me that ALL repairs are COVERED by my CPO WARRANTY!!!! I call Courtesy to advise and the just blow it off that they attempted to bilk me out of almost 5k in repairs; as a ""training issue""..one that has apparently been pervasive since I purchased the car 2+ years ago! Not only was the rocker issue covered; SO WAS THE LEAK!!! 
Here we go, I take the car in on Thursday due to a concern I have with the differential after an alignment. Set an appointment; only for the tech to ASK ME IF I HAVE A WARRANTY! WHILE HE HAS MY VEHICLE RECORDS UP! I mention that the other dealership was able to access the records and find the warranty with NO ISSUES and he ""blows me off"". He then takes the time to tell me that they will need to keep my car for an extended period; just for the diagnosis! I ask if they can diagnose, order parts; then I will bring the car back for the repair...he declines! I know what they are doing...they don't want to do the repair because they know it is covered under warranty and they want to continue BILKING customers!!!

Today, I opted for the Chorizo Scramble -- a super hearty mix of chorizo, eggs, salsa, and cheese, served with potatoes and tortillas. This is some serious stick-to-your-ribs brunch. (Case in point: I'm writing this review at 5:30 p.m. and probably won't get hungry for a couple more hours.) The chorizo here isn't as spicy as I generally like it, but it's still quite good. 

My dining companions had an omelet of their own design (mushrooms, cheese, and avocado) and the Blue Willow Benedict, a classic eggs benedict with poached eggs and ham on english muffins with a gruyere sauce. Both loved their meals! 

Though today I wanted savory rather than sweet, I also really like Blue Willow's pancakes -- particularly when they have pumpkin pancakes in the fall! They're fluffy and buttery, with a gentle spice that complements their sweetness. 

Though I don't stay to browse these days, I also enjoy the selection of items in Blue Willow's gift shop. They have charming decorative items, funny and cute mugs from local makers, lovely greeting cards, and more. It's a great spot to look for a gift with some Tucson flavor.

A word on Blue Willow's current take-out set-up: I really like the ease of online or phone ordering (I've used both during the pandemic), and their highly organized shelves for pickup just inside the door of the gift shop, so you don't have to go all the way in or linger while they fetch your food. Also, every time I've gotten take-out, the food is still so hot at the time of pickup that you can't touch the containers for more than a second without it being uncomfortable, which means it's the perfect temperature to eat when you get it home. Well done!",2021-01-18 00:44:30,386,1873,

Price - $15 ea.  A little on the high side for what you get. 

Employees were friendly and offered to be available if needed.  
Good selection of merchandise with logo and wall-art for purchase. 
Due to COVID, you have to wear a mask and social distance.  
No pictures allowed.  (I think this is because you can find a good chunk of on The Google)

If gore or graphic imagery is what your eyeballs desire
If you can stomach real crime scene photos, guts and all
If your heart can handle littles laid ready for their dirt nap 
If national headlines, books, pamphlets, documents, and random letters about tragic events, diabolical acts/behaviors, and evil are your reading choice and you love reading (a lot of reading, bunches, just like this review, but more! And better written)
If you are intrigued by serial killers, who they were/are, what they did, who/how they murdered, things they have owned or made, how they ended up
If you like to see tools/mechanisms or other random old timey devices
If you like to read, A LOT, and don't have OCD or a problem with total randomness that may or may not have to do with the actual history or facts about death other than serial killers, evil jerks, cannibalism or taxidermy.... This is for you! 

What it is.... 
This is a hodgepodge, self guided tour of eclectic displays sectioning one large room (see details below or website) and one smaller room (Theater of Death) set up like a funeral viewing/service area. Church pews face a tv for video that wasn't available for viewing, there is a casket is in the back, the corner has a cheesy Día de los Muertos display including an alter to place offerings with random, almost goofy pictures, and a Walmart sugar skull piñata to really add to tradition. On the walls, covering top to bottom, you'll find various clippings and front pages of different newspapers and topics ranging from Disney to Nazis.  

::Displays:: (some repeated info)
Behind curtain #1... On this self guided tour you can see a hodgepodge of eclectic items on display including: random memorabilia of serial killers - books, pamphlets, magazine and newspaper articles on: presidential assassinations, Nazis, headline crimes, and other various stories - photographs of famous and infamous - crime scenes, car crashes, time period death photography, mug shots, random snapshots of the evil people or the things they did - various things created by or used by evil including: drawings/artwork/crafts, hand written letters, tools and instruments used to cause death or to determine it - some unusual taxidermy of random animals including a dog, a horse, and rodents to name a few - various animals, bones, and even some organs preserved in jars - a few full human skeletons that I'm pretty sure are not authentic - a few coffins and closed caskets you are asked not to open along with other articles you would find in a mortuary or funeral home - death masks of famous/infamous dudes - some artifacts and a few shrunken heads amongst other random trinkets and things from/about cannibalism.  Behind curtain #2... There was suppose to be a video in the Theater of Death (funeral viewing like area described above) but, it was not available due to Covid.  There is another video towards the end that runs through a few different topics on repeat but, even it was random choppy.  

Overall, I think it was an interesting collection of items that not everyone can, will, or should see.  I would only go back to read more of the stuff I missed from skimming through when I was tired of reading.  There is a lot to read.  Little to see.",2021-01-11 10:31:50,728,3656,

They told us that we could return any pieces we didn't use because we were on the fence about ordering that day since we weren't exactly sure how much we needed. So we took six pieces with us, ordered some pieces, and then decided to do the entire wall and ordered several boxes the next day. These aren't small pieces, they were 17x17 tiles, $25.00 a piece and I spent $900 + on them so we wanted to make sure if we had anything left, it could be returned. Today we go to return the 4-5 left over tiles and they tell us we can't return the tile unless we ordered it piece by piece. Joke was on them though because we had ordered 6 pieces separately in the beginning (they didn't know that from the order they were looking at so they thought they could deny us the return, their smirk fell off their face though when we told them to check the other order). If we had not had that separate order they were going to refuse to allow us to return the tile even though they had already told us in store, in person that we could, or at least lied to us to get the sale. That's a very shady game. I will never return there based off that experience.  I don't like to be lied to or played games with. We have two more bathrooms, a kitchen and the laundry room that all need tile which is going to be EXPENSIVE , we were actually headed back there this weekend to pick out for one of the bathrooms but after today, I'll spend my money elsewhere.

The Indianapolis Arts Center started in 1934 as a Works Progress Administration program. It now offers hundreds of instructional programs, over 50 exhibits across six galleries, and outreach to underserved communities. Of course, it also serves up the OneAmerica Broad Ripple Art Fair. 

It's a non-profit organization - meaning that it's largely donation driven. Indianapolis Art Center moved into its current Broad Ripple location on the banks of White River in 1976. In 2005, Indianapolis architect Michael Graves designed ARTSPARK, the Indianapolis Art Center's 9.5 acre art meets nature ""exhibit"" that is interactive and extraordinary. 

Indianapolis Art Center is one of those places where you don't quite realize all it offers until you actually go there. As your browsing the grounds, you can't help but be a bit in awe of everything it has to offer. 

I visited yesterday to check out their new coffee shop, The Library, that serves up coffees/teas and pastries and allows you to linger in the Ruth Lilly Library. While much of what's going on with the Art Center these days is virtual due to the pandemic, there are still activities and still exhibits. Masks are required, social distancing is expected, and floors have been clearly marked. In essence, there's a ""route"" through exhibits to reduce any possibility of congestion. 

While I was there, I checked out the exhibits and loved checking out works by adults and children. The Art Center offers a wide variety of classes including clay, drawing, fibers, glass, jewelry/metals, painting, photo/digital, print/book arts, sculpture, wood, and has an open studio (though the open studio is currently significantly limited due to the pandemic). They rent lockers to students to make things more convenient. Most of the classes are quite affordable and Indianapolis Art Center also offers tuition assistance programs. 

You can also rent multiple areas of the Art Center and prices are surprisingly affordable. This includes galleries, the auditorium, the riverfront, the parking lots, and more! I've seen special events here, weddings, and even film festivals. They auditorium, as I recall, seats 247 people. I've heard they can be a little fussy around scheduling and the auditorium, but most people I know who've done it say it has been a good experience. 

I've attended multiple events here. 

There's plenty of parking. There's ramps at all entrances, though during the pandemic they seem to be limiting entry to the main entrance. There's typically 1-2 people at the main desk (I don't know if these are volunteers or employees, though they are always friendly). 

There's accessible parking. The main entry also has automatic doors by push-button, a great option for wheelchair users. While the distance from the parking lot is a bit further than I'd like, it's workable. 

Memberships are available ranging from $55-125. 

The Indianapolis Art Center is easily a walking distance from most places in Broad Ripple. You can also easily access it off the Monon Trail. There were people actively in the library yesterday - tables were well spaced. It tends to be a more quiet space. People were also actively visiting the galleries yesterday. Some of the art work is for sale (and clearly marked).

If you check out the Indianapolis Art Center website, you'll also see the Art Center Marketplace and be able to explore buying local, regional, or national art for your home. The 83rd Annual Student Show is currently on display and a great way to get out of the house without much risk of encountering other humans!",2021-01-31 15:13:36,713,3716,

She made an appointment online for a single process color and partial highlight- no cut, and was under the impression that would be around $200. I believe it said ""from $185"" online for these services. That does indicate there is potential to be more than that, but one would imagine it would be in that ballpark. Although she booked a partial highlight, her stylist said it would likely take a full highlight to achieve the look she wanted. These were painted on without foils and were very subtle. So subtle, in fact, she had a hard time telling much of a difference in the way her hair looked after her services than when she arrived. When she checked out, her total was over $300. $360, with tip.

$360. For color. Only.

This is double what she expected to pay, based on her online booking. It is far beyond anything I ever paid at Local Honey, and is indeed far beyond anything I have ever paid for cut, color, and highlights combined at any salon in my 15+ years in Nashville. The lack of transparency in pricing, the assumption that a client would be fine paying double what she expected to pay, with no indication that would be the case... it's just not what I ever would have hoped or recommended for my sister. She has reached out to the salon over email and not received any response. I did the same, over email and Facebook. No response to either of us. Nothing. I would hope the salon would be invested in making this right, and perhaps in instituting some more transparency around pricing expectations for services- particularly for new clients.

While she had plenty of great things to say about the kindness and talent of her stylist, the end result is that her hair looks much the same as it did when she walked into the salon, and she has paid nearly $400- unfathomable pricing for a simple color and highlight. To potential clients- make sure you know exactly what you are paying and what services you will receive for that price. There is also an additional $35 fee added to your appointment for use of their products- yes, the products used in your appointment, not anything extra.

I'm sad to say I will be unable to recommend Local Honey to other friends and family, if this is what can be expected.",2021-01-22 18:27:59,494,2403,

It turned out to be a horrible experience and if it hadn't been his bday, we would have gotten up and left.  First, our server brought us some menus and we ordered food and one of the drink specials.  She came back about 5 minutes later and said she couldn't honor the drink prices on the menu she gave us because it was an old menu.  We were confused, but fine with it because obviously she had made a mistake.  Then they bring our fries out without the other food we had ordered.  I asked them to bring all our food out together because nobody wants their entree's separately.  It's like ordering a sandwich and they just bring you the bread and tell you to eat it while you're waiting for the meet/cheese, it doesn't make sense.  She said she could bring them out with the rest of our food, but that they would be cold.  I asked to speak to the manager, but she never showed up.  After awhile, I got up and and asked the front desk person for the manager and waited there in the front until she came out to talk to me.  She honored the drink price that we were given, but told us we could only have 1 drink. When they finally did bring us our our food, they didn't bring out my sister's order.  About 10 minutes went by, and I had to get up and go find our server to ask where it was.  When they finally did bring it, our server said that the cooks had messed up our order in the back and forgot to make her food.  So we all had to sit there and let our food get cold until she had hers too.  Our service was unacceptable for the amount of money I spent, and we will not be eating there ever again.",2021-01-27 01:46:13,378,1717,

Their original location is in Largo, but they're branching out which is great for our area. It's a build your own rice bowl, salad bowl, wrap, chalupas, or toston platter kind of place. Only it has a variety of Latin flavors and they actually grill your choice of protein while you wait. The seasoned pork smelled so good as they were grilling it. They also have extras such as filled tostones, empanadas, tamales, tostones, yucca cheese bites, and a jalapeño queso.

I actually visited twice in 2 days. The first day I got the filled pork toston. It had great flavor! The pork was seasoned perfectly. The tostones were fresh and crispy. It looked like a jibarito, but this was more of a street version that has more flavor because of the added lime cilantro sauce. There was shredded lettuce, tomato, and mozzarella cheese as well. The pork was tender. It was so tasty! When I got to the bottom, the last toston had soaked in some of that sauce and pork seasoning and it was just the perfect ending. I love it, and I'll totally get it again. They also have a tostones platter which is like a nachos platter but with tostones. I'm getting that next time because it sounds like a larger version of the filled toston only with your choice of toppings. 

They have steak, chicken, ground beef, veggie, shredded beef, and shredded pork for the proteins. The base can be white rice, brown rice, or black beans (or a combination of rice & beans). They have tons of toppings such as these mini sweet plantains, lettuce, tomatoes, corn, cilantro, and many more. I went back the next day to try their rice bowl. I had brown rice with black beans as the base and topped it with maduros, tomatoes, avocado, mozzarella, cilantro, and the lime cilantro sauce. I was happy with all the flavors which blended perfectly. The steak was my protein. It was hot and fresh, but I actually like the shredded pork more than the steak. There are about 6 different sauces, but it's going to be difficult for me to deviate from that lime cilantro sauce. I crave that sauce now. Which means I'll be back for more. They also give you complimentary chips and salsa with each order. I was happy to see an extra lime cilantro container in my bag. That sauce is seriously good stuff. 

The only negative would be the flan. It's one of those Lila's Desserts from Miami. It was meh, because I'm used to homemade flan. If you don't know the difference, then you'll probably like it. But then again, you're not coming here for the flan. Other than that, everything was wonderful. The staff was very helpful, friendly, and professional. They all wore masks and the protocols were in place.  The food is all covered and away from patrons. They have a case full of a variety of beverages including Jarritos. The also have a soda fountain. The restaurant is clean. They have a TV in the sitting area. You can dine in or take out. I didn't see an outdoor area. It's in the middle of the Aldi strip mall between Chick & Bones and Plato's Closet. There is plenty of parking. What more can I say? Oh, the prices are very reasonable and the food is fresh and flavorful. All reasons to come back for more. They will be having a grand opening next month, so watch for that. I'm so glad they are here in Brandon.",2021-01-11 23:17:15,731,3355,

Said he'd arrive between 1pm and 6pm, but he showed up at 11am, so we weren't ready. My wife had to get out of the shower to open the door for him. He checked why my garage door wasn't opening and told me it was the motor since it was 20+ years old. That was good to know, since it wasn't the spring or rails. 

Then he tried to sell me a replacement motor for $750, like I wasn't going to google how much a motor costs. He kept telling me about a bunch of discounts that would make me only have to pay for the motor and not labor so it would just be $750 and not $950. When I said I'd have to talk to my wife about it before dropping almost $1000, he got more and more pushy, saying if I didn't agree to him doing the work right then and there, it would be even more expensive. Almost like he knew that if I google how much a motor costs or talked to anyone, I'd realize he was ripping me off. I had to tell him I wasn't having him do the work that day 6 times before he got the message. He kept offering different ways of spreading the cost over a year, and I kept saying ""it's still very expensive, no matter how long you spread it out for, and I need to talk about it with my wife"". Literally 6 times before he stopped being pushy.

Then he put a huge sticker on my door and on my old motor that says the warranty is void if I remove or cover the sticker. What warranty? He didn't work on my door or motor, just looked at it to tell me what was wrong.

The good news is that despite that, he technically did do what I wanted and told me what the problem was. I went to home depot and bought a motor for $150 and installed it myself. Now it works perfectly.",2021-01-04 00:39:41,398,1698,

Although it isn't quite as clandestine as the prohibition era speakeasies, the bar does a good job of masking their location.  Even if you know which building it is in, they don't have any signage pointing to their entrance and no sliding panel to knock on to give a password.  Fortunately, you don't need a password to get in here, but it does take some patience to find and helps to have good word of mouth from someone.  As a matter of fact, the bartender doesn't want anyone to set this up on Yelp because he's afraid it will become just like any other bar.  He wanted to maintain the secret place which is why I haven't given any specifics about how to find the entrance.  They have a huge instagram following, so I don't see what problem Yelp is going to add.  If you are in the area, stop for dinner at one of the local restaurants and ask for assistance finding it.
  Inside the bar is rather dark but with mid century furniture grouped in the open space before the bar.  The bar (mainly cocktails) is along the back wall and when we first visited, my wife and I were told to just grab a seat at one of the tables.  It was 5 pm on a Thursday evening, so the place was rather empty.  Lots of room at that time for social distancing.  
  The bartender came over with actual cocktail lists that made it easier to determine what we wanted to order.  I prefer gin drinks, so I ordered the ""Corpse of New Orleans"" which is served in a small Peychauds bitters bottle with a metal straw.  My wife isn't much of a cocktail drinker, so she described what she liked and the bartender made her a ""Clarified Milk Punch"" which she really enjoyed since she likes the flavor of margaritas most places, this was closest to what they had available.  
  There isn't food available, but since Maialina is on the same floor of the building, we came back the night before Halloween with two other couples, dined Italian, and then headed over to the Commodore entrance for cocktails.
  The bar was decorated for Halloween and was very dark inside with only some purple lights (possibly black lights).  We grabbed some lounge seating just large enough for the six of us.  But no menus were offered, just Ouija boards with the cocktails etched in with small red letters.  Nearly impossible for us to read in the low lighting.  If that's all they offer you, just ask for a real menu to make it easier on yourself to figure out what the house specialties are.
  The place was much more crowded the second night since it was a Friday and a little later in the evening.  They had the music turned up a bit too loud for conversation which I don't get.  There is no room for a dance floor, so why so loud?  We got them to turn it down enough so that we could enjoy our visit with each other as well as the ambiance.
  I wonder if this place that opened during the pandemic and chooses to hide deep inside a building with no signage to let customers know where to find them, AND discourages social media will make it.  It's a cool place for folks who like cocktails, but if you are just a ""dive bar"" kinda patron, you probably won't like the limited offerings and high priced drinks.  I doubt they carry bud light, but I didn't ask.
  I will say that everyone in our group who ordered a cocktail enjoyed what they had.  Our friend who only drinks straight rye was pleased with their selection.  
  Unless this place gets a following of ""regulars"", I think the lack of attention will make it fall victim to poor cash flow like so many other places.  The novelty of the place is in finding it.  Once you are here, it seems just like any other bar with tasty cocktails.  I don't know if that is enough to continue bring folks in.

We had planned to order our food from Cafe Milano 10mins before half time, so that our food would be ready during half time.
I called and ordered the Peppermill Melt ($16) for myself and the Peppermill Burger ($16) for my husband. Our food was ready within 20 mins and pickup was quick and easy.
I returned to the Sportsbook to resume the 2nd half of the game, while enjoy our dinner. 
Upon opening my togo box I noticed the lack of quality in the sandwich. I took a bite and immediately regretted my order. The ham was bland and looked like a handful of pieces were pulled straight from a package, slapped on the grill, and then immediately transferred to the sandwich. The cheese tasted low graded and the bacon was fatty and barely warm. I really only took 2 bites and could not finish it, so I attempted to at least enjoy my waffle fries (because who doesn't love fries?), well those too were unedible as well...very salty and dry. 
As for the Burger. It was really good! My husband shared a few bites with me and he thoroughly enjoyed it. I was so disappointed that I lost my appetite.
I've been to other Peppermill restaurants and have actually eaten breakfast at Cafe Milano in the past, so I know what they're capable of, therefore I will not rate this experience entirely on one of the worst warm sandwiches I've ever eaten.",2021-01-11 22:24:58,308,1468,

The staff were great when I asked about something and they served me at the hot food section - no one told me to go stand in the back to wait.

I am not a big fan of fish but seafood I do love. The variety is insane.. shrimp , squid, lobsters , and musssels..oh my ! 
I just walked around a bit to see what else they had in stock. Everything for home cooking chinese food is all here.. even woks .

There was absolutely no one there waiting and no one came in during my visit, so I'm not sure why she was rude and dramatic about me being a walk in. Normally I would expect they would be thankful for the extra business, especially during COVID times. 

As the cherry on top, she had headphones in BOTH ears and was speaking in other language and laughing on the phone the entire time she did my brows. I asked for my brows to be cleaned up and get the strays, as it hadn't been more than a month since I last had them, the shape was still clearly there.

We looked at a number of assisted living spaces in the Santa Barbara/Camarillo area, but when we found Mariposa, we immediately knew it was the place for her. I met with the Community Relations Director, Nicholas Begane, who treated me to a delicious lunch and gave me a tour of the gorgeous and thoughtfully-designed building. At that point I'd toured a number of AL facilities in Arizona, on the East Coast, and in California, and Mariposa was far and away the loveliest in every respect. It is such a warm and inviting place - thoughtfully designed to accommodate the needs of seniors, but with none of the cliched trappings of an ""old folks' home"". It's light, airy, modern, and it provides amenities that make you feel at home and cared for in the most humane way. 

Beyond aesthetics, design, wonderful food, and great activities (including on-site physical therapy), what sets Mariposa apart is the staff.  Simply put, they are stellar human beings who actually care about the well-being of their residents. It was clear to me from the get-go that Mariposa Executive Director, Peter Bonilla, prioritizes hiring only people who put humanity first. From the beginning, Nicholas Begane has been our guiding angel. He made what is typically a tough transition for many seniors (especially my mom) as smooth as could be, and didn't just stop once we'd signed the contract.  To this day, I know that I can contact Nicholas with a question or an issue, and he's right there to help.  And this goes for all of the Mariposa staff, from Peter, to Dory, Denay, Naomi, Muhammed, Ramon, the care staff & the wonderful kitchen/dining crew - they are all just amazing, and I know it's genuine because my mother is one tough customer, and she is constantly telling me how kind, thoughtful, and helpful everyone is. I am beyond grateful for their care, and I cannot express how good it feels to know that mom is in a place where she is valued and respected. We'd always hoped that mom could live out her years at home. Thankfully, we've found a home in Mariposa.",2021-01-11 23:06:26,450,2195,

To start, after a wildly invasive phone call 2 days prior to our reservation and explicitly requesting a table, we got sat at the bar. As a party of 3, it was uncomfortable and we started off on a terrible foot. Our bartender was incredibly awkward and whenever he tried to make conversation with us it felt like he was reading a company script. He did tell us that a magician would be over soon to entertain us for a minute. (Just wait to hear how that turned out) We decided to all try the Dovetail Shuffle signature cocktail and it drastically disappointed. The $15 cocktail tasted like it was made with the cheapest tequila known to man and was honestly horrible overall. The only thing that cocktail has to hold on to was the adorable floral garnish. We didn't plan to get food but it smelt exquisite so we decided on a couple French onion soups, fries and Mac and cheese, and let me just say I should've just gone to McDonald's because it would've been 20x better and far more affordable. I honestly can say I had not had a bad meal in my entire visit to Nashville until this evening at House of Cards. It was blatantly obvious that every employee in the restaurant assumed we were broke college students based upon our young appearance and the fact that we chose not to order entrees. Remember how I mentioned that the bartender said a magician would be right over? Well an hour and a half later we still had not had a magician come by to see us while we watched them attend to some parties more than once. We even told the general manager we had not yet seen a magician and 25 minutes later nothing had changed. On the way out, we told the hostess we couldn't find the manager but we wanted to let them know we had a terrible experience and she tried to literally drag us back into that hell hole despite us telling her multiple times we didn't have any more time to spend there this evening. Overall, this place was outrageously pretentious, absurdly overpriced and wildly overrated. I'm a server myself, and my moderately priced BBQ restaurant treats everyone like they're the greatest people in the building, even if they're only ordering a drink. Wish I could say the same about this place. House of cards deserves negative 5 stars.",2021-01-10 04:11:34,493,2469,

We were informed that they work with Park Lighting for all the lighting in their homes. We had a lighting allowance set at the initial home purchase. 

We were contacted by email to book an appointment to come in to choose our lights. I have driven by this store front over the years and always wanted to go inside but had no reason. We were excited to get a chance to choose something for the home.. felt like things were finally happening. 

Due to covid-19 ,when you walk in they have sanitizer setup as you enter the building. When you have entered you are greeted by so many lighting options and all the lights are lit, so you can imagine it's super bright. We checked in at the front desk and were told our sales rep would be with us right away.

We waited only a few minutes for her (Charlene Hofstede). She approached us and introduced herself and confirmed our names with her home building document (only named individuals can attend the appointment due to restrictions).  

She navigated us to a table to go over our plans and confirm if there were any changes we need to make and also go over the game plan. Charlene was great at making sure everything was correct on the plan and the total amount of lights we would need to pick.

We started with the outdoor lighting, she wanted to ensure that we saw what the basic option was and all the other options and was very transparent with the prices. It was pretty easy as the base options were pretty decent. We quickly decided then went on to all the options for the LED flush lights and the sizes etc. 

We were then looking at options for our dinning, pendants for the island, entrance and lighting for the dinning room... those were a little bit more difficult. Charlene allowed us some time alone to discuss once she showed us the options and what worked together from the fixtures that caught our attention first. 

Once we figured out everything. Charlene went through the lightbulb selection.. who knew that was a thing??  so many different options and sizes. 

We reviewed the pricing and selection.. which we surprisingly only went over by $1,300.. I sure was proud of myself.  I assumed I would go over by a lot.. thankfully I didn't. 

The restock fee was discussed to make sure that if we change any fixture after the delivery, as well as that we could do pay 50% deposit on the excess amount and the remain at the house closing.

Overall great experience. Wish I could do it more often.. I recommended this place to anyone looking for a refreshing on their lighting fixtures.",2021-01-19 11:40:21,519,2620,

I am certain there are more professional, less costly, and better moving companies out there. Goodness knows, for your sake, and for our next move, there had better be.

From start to finish, they are a group of indifferent, uncaring, conniving, and manipulative people who's single focus is to convince you that they have your best interest at heart and are on your side. All that is true, of course, until you actually poke further and engage with them and realize that you are trapped and that no amount of phone calls, texts, and requests will improve the quality of the service, their communication, or their concern for how much they inconvenience you and make you genuinely fear for the disposition and delivery of your items.

Yes, we did research and interviewed them, but despite my generally suspicious and cautious nature - a product of my Jersey upbringing - I fell for the pitch and believed that we had made the right choice. 

I'm attaching pictures, but they don't do justice to the way things were moved. Of course there are no ways or images the capture the extent of their false promises and deceit.

Samples: 

""You have such a large load that you will have a truck for your load and will be able to specify a delivery date"" - David 

""We are sending our best crew to move you."" - Sonya - This Crew consisting of one senior guy and three Junior guys, literally crapped and pissed disgustingly in both of our bathrooms and when I asked them to clean it up, they denied it was them. There will be a picture that may or may not clearly show an orange tinge on the wrapping paper used for our kitchen items. This was the result of one of the young men eating Doritos while wrapping our stuff, despite my asking him not to do it.

The way in which things were packed was reflected in one broken piece of furniture, the bent main support bar of our bed, parts of furniture missing, and other items scratched, dented, or generally just ruined.

After two months of waiting for our stuff, the two-person crew that delivered the things or so unbelievably unprofessional, that besides there nasty and condescending attitude, they actually put all of the boxes for the inside of the house in the living room, despite clear direction and markings on the boxes indicating where they should go in the house. At least they didn't use the bathroom...

""Just call me anytime that you have issues... Here is my direct extension..."" - Jeremy - the only time I was able to reach him after the initial conversation, he said we had never spoken before.

First time in building purchasing product, I had done online pick up before. I like how professional almost all I encountered  today. But, I found the pharmacist I saw to be really lacking. I have already had my initial pharmacist visit at another provider.

 Today, I made an appointment at 2pm at Terra Vida for a pharmacist visit. I arrived at 1:45, joined the 7 other customers waiting outside (totally appropriate covid protocol). When I called for my appointment I was told I  would get a phone call when it was my appointment time. I finally got to the front of the line, told the gentleman working the door I had an appointment with the pharmacist at 2 and was told he would get me in when there was space. No problem, I finally went in and at reception I also mentioned my appointment and was told okay. At 2:30  I was called into the purchasing area, and I asked my bud tender about my appointment with the pharmacist. The bud tender very kindly took my paperwork out of the room and came back and said he got me a spot.with the pharmacist.  One hour after my scheduled appointment I finally saw the pharmacist. He never said his name, he never really even greeted me, and certainly didn't ask me.any questions to assess my current medical conditions. I finally said what I was there for, he offered some suggestions and told me to ask my bud tender for a better idea of what was in stock. Done, I walked out the door to wait again. Once in the purchasing area I had a very competent bud tender who listened to me and help me choose my product. I am writing because my experience with the pharmacist at Apothecarium was so much more helpful. She knew.product in shock by her computer, offered suggestions and gave me price and type of delivery method of medicine options. I felt comfortable and listened to, I also get a.10% discount. If you know what you need and have no use for a pharmacist to guide you, TerraVida is great. If, like me, you have some complex medical needs and are looking for help and direction for medical  needs, today was not a strong showing",2021-01-30 21:36:48,442,2194,

We had an appointment today for our English bulldog to have an ultrasound done to see how many puppies she is going to be having in 15 days. One of the ladies come out and asked my fiance how many days along she is and he said 38 and meant 48 days. She takes our dog inside and calls his cell phone and says sir if its only 38 days than we can't do the ultrasound on her today. He proceeds to tell her "" than why when my fiance called down here and told you the date they locked you could.. it makes no sense to waste anyone's time"" the lady then puts him on hold and comes back to the phone and says sir it would be 48 days not 38. He than says oh im sorry I didn't add the days up right. She hangs up the phone. Than sends our dog back outside after they do the ultrasound and send some little ass guy outside to tell him that they are now refusing to do the c-section on our dog because he cursed the girl out on the phone which he DID NOT do. This place has ignorant and immature ass females who work there that lie and refuse services whenever they want to. Ive dealt with this place a couple of times before and they have 2 women in particular who is always snotty, rude and disrespectful. I would advise anyone to take their animals to formea and not to pope. Their business should be shut down from lack of customers. I dont see how anyone can take their animals to sure disrespectful people who don't even care for your animals properly. We had one of our other dogs brought there who had 13 puppies inside of her and 5 of them died. Took her all day to deliver the puppies and she was tired and struggling. They just sent us out the door with her. We got her home and realized her puppies were comming out with no sack and no breathing and she wasn't pushing. They argued with my fiance and said that one shot shoulda took care of her birthing them all which it didn't. So they got rude with him and told him to come back if he wanted another shot but she wasn't gonna need it. He took her back and they gave it to her and she delivered 3 more on the way back home to alton. I dont like leaving bad reviews but I will for this place.

This place came highly recommended to me by a friend, and I've gone there for repairs and purchases several times since. They have fixed screens, charging ports, (and even a camera one time) for me at least five times, I never went anywhere else bc, well, why would I? These guys are obv the best and most fair as far as $$. 

But this last time. 
It was less than a week ago (one day passed between the two visits to the store that I'm talking about now). I had a broken screen for awhile and had finally been able to squeeze in a cell phone repair bill so thought-yes! I'll go to my place and get my phone fixed! Sweet!  
So I go, ofc they fix the phone better than when I left before, bc they're that good. I left completely happy.
The problems started that night as I was going to bed...dropped my phone onto my nightstand (a distance of no more than 6"" ...and yea I kno I still shouldn't have just dropped it the way I did but jeez are these things that delicate??) and BAM shattered screen. I'm being dramatic, it was not SHATTERED but it's cracked bad enough to suck, especially when I Just paid to have it fixed.
I didn't worry though, because I figured the dudes at QF would be able to fix this. 
But...I went back because SURELY there is some kind of warranty or something, but no. Guy just said I was SOL. The warranty doesn't cover the part and he can't get it replaced. Or something. He did put on a new tempered glass for me for free which was cool of him I guess.

So in conclusion, these guys are good at what they do but i feel somehow burned by them. You're telling me you own this place, you're a small business, you care about your customers, you make the rules, and there's NOTHING you can do to help me out here? He did say something about coming back and he'll fix it a little cheaper for me, which is also cool. I guess. I wondered why he couldn't just give me a discount then? Like, why make me come back? I would have said go for it, and plz also fix this other issue I've been having that the other employee informally quoted me on the last time I was here.",2021-01-27 09:51:06,518,2249,

I decided to have dinner there on NYE evening. I didn't have a reservation, I waited about 30-35mins to sit in the bar, the tables in the bar where all spaced out, all staff wore masks, there were hand sanitizer. It was a cold NYE around 28°, where I was sitting by the window very cold, had to change my seat to the seat over from the window. My Server was Crystan she was so nice, warm, people person, and very professional. For, my appetizer I had the lobster bisque soup I thought it was just okay, too many veggies, and not enough lobster. My entrée I had spaghetti & meatballs, so good, a slight kick, and it was so fulfilling. Drink wise I had the Cooper's Hawk margarita that was good too, sugar around my rim, and it wasn't strong, and the last drink I had was the Champagne cocktail. Now, that Champagne cocktail was covered by the bartender since I went on NYE, that Champagne cocktail was made from Blanc de Blanc, Rémy Martin VSOP, Bitters, Lemon Peel. That Champagne cocktail so delicious, and it made me feel like I was somewhat else briefly.
As, far as accessible there are a lot of stairs didn't see an area where someone who uses a wheelchair could enter the restaurant easy. Cooper's Hawk is known for their wines, even chocolates, the restaurant does offer dine in, carryout, curbside pickup, and delivery. Cooper's Hawk does have a tasting room, open from 11am-9pm where you can sample the wines, and buy the bottles. Also, Cooper's Hawk does have a wine club too, great location, great for meetings, dating, and just going out to eat. Since, the COVID pandemic the restaurant has made adjustments to their establishment like other places.

However, I never really order food items because each time there has been something wrong with my food order. Today, I order my food through the drive thru because I had things to do and it was closest to home. I paid (over $20) which seemed high for what I ordered, but didn't question it at the time because I had waited long enough. I get home to realize that the burger I ordered had additional toppings on there I didn't ask for and that I had a basket of a meal when I only wanted the one menu item, not as a meal. I return to the restaurant, go in and set the food on the counter. First of all, the competence and care of the employees in this location is extremely lacking. The man who appeared to be in charge was rude as hell. Apparently didn't understand what I was saying and continued to ask me ""so you're upset because you got some extra chicken and free fries"". NO! I was charged for it and didn't want it! So he refunds me $2.20 in cash, when I paid on a card, for the price difference, then remakes the burger after telling me the girl who took the order wrote down everything on the burger. Her lack of communication is not my fault! Not to mention when she didn't get the order correct. So I'm annoyed. At this point, the rest of the food is cold as I get back to my house.

Our group did the bottomless brunch (which is truly bottomless) and bottomless mimosas (had to cure that hangover - right?!) Overall, the experience was really positive. The only thing preventing this from being a 5-star was the service. 

Ambiance - This is SUCH a cool place. It has classic movies playing all day on a big screen in the main room. The lighting makes it quant and cozy - probably perfect for a date night. The booths were perfect for a small group of a hungover adults to lounge in. 

Service - Not great. We sat and waited 10-15 minutes just for a server to come by and tell us that someone would help us shortly and another 10 minutes to even place an order for mimosas. While I understand it was new years day and likely extremely busy, it seemed like quite a long time to wait. And every time we wanted to add items to our order, we had to flag down our waitress. 

Food - SO GOOD! The fruit pebbles french toast is out of this world! The bottomless brunch is an awesome concept and it truly is bottomless. Rather than buffet style, the table orders anything/everything they want to the table from the menu. We tried pretty much everything on the menu between the four of us (they're fairly small plates). Personal favorites: the french toast (duh!), the usual suspect, and the sinema scramble (we ordered quite a few of these!). 

Mimosas (because this deserves it's own section - it's called priorities) - Oh  the mimosas. YES YES YES!

I've been eating here since I was a child and there's a lot of tastes associated with childhood but all that aside, you will not find a fresher burger anywhere.  Do you know how fast the turn over rate is for their ingredients is?  Weekdays, weekends... they are busy 24/7.  They're like the DMV for hamburgers.  Coming back to my point- their ingredients don't have time to spoil and they cook burgers so fast that they don't need to freeze their meat.

What's special about their burger is how it all comes together.  You can have the freshest ingredients in the world, but putting them together in a balanced way is what makes a burger outstanding.  In-N-Out does it with ease.  No matter how you alter the burger to your taste- protein style without the bun, animal style with grilled onions and pickles, or 4x4 style with 4 patties, you cannot go wrong with taste.

The cherry on top is In-N-Outs fast and friendly service. You would think that there are thousands on minions working inside. They are just so fast and efficient that a line never scares me away when I'm craving burgers.

Did I mention how affordable their burgers are?  You can go all out for the whole family and it will most likely not break the bank.

Notes:
-Why only 4 stars?  The low reviews are from people that are trying to shoo away others so they don't have to wait any longer in line. 
-Do you want an impossible In-N-Out burger?  Go across the street and order the impossible patty from Burger King and toss it into a vegetarian In-N-Out Cheesburger. Yes, I've done it for my father and he loved it!
-We love animal style: mustard grilled into the patty, pickles, chopped grilled onion and an extra helping of their famous sauce
-I always get animal style with yellow chili peppers, raw onion, & extra tomato added. Beyond delicious!
-Like Michael T. points out, yes, you can get a whole grilled onion!
-You can ask for extra spread packets, whole chili peppers, salt, pepper & ketchup on the side.
-animal style fries- fresh cut potatoes fried in sunflower oil topped with their famous sauce, cheese and chopped grilled onions
-You can regulate the salt on your burger and fries.  You can also ask for your bun extra toasted if that's your thing.
-their milkshakes have always been too thick for my taste but you can remedy it by ordering a side of milk and adding it in to your shake to thin it out, leave room in the cup. Neopolitan is a combination of all three flavors- vanilla, chocolate & strawberry
-you can pay with Apple or Samsung pay for a contract free transaction
-There are plenty ways to customize your burger. 
-I always wear a mask when ordering and picking up from the window to keep everyone safe.  A Covid outbreak at In-N-Out would definitely not be good for everyone's sanity, soul and tummy. 
-There have been little to no changes to their menu throughout history.  The old fashioned way is the best way.  
-The workers are always nice to my kids. Some have offered stickers to them
-They control all their ingredients. process their own meat, make their own buns, source the best produce from farms.
-Outdoor seating available
-You can go in and order take out.

I came here for take out on a Thursday night for a few friends! The food choices vary between Chinese and Korean! The staff was so nice and friendly and they threw in Pork Taro Springrolls on the house (probably because we did a large order).

Thai Tea- one of the best Thai teas I've had because it wasn't sweet- I also asked for it not to be sweet. But it went down smoothly! 5/5

Passion fruit tea- this was tart but also very sweet. I had to dilute it with water. I thought I asked for it to be slightly sweet but maybe they didn't hear me. Would have been more refreshing if the sugar was reduced. 3/5

Mango fruit tea- this was very sweet as well. It's pretty much the same review minus the tartness. This one had more tea taste to it. 3/5

Chick 'n Cheese Rangoons- the favourite appetizer of the night! It was a beautiful item and so soft yet thick in the middle. The cheese isn't runny like in other rangoons. The cheese wasn't too salty as well! 5/5

Pork Taro Springrolls- this was gifted to us by the generous chef and staff of the resto! Wonderful crispness to the shell. The inside was a nice thick and meaty filling. It was like Kofta (middle eastern dish) but softer. That's probably due to the Taro. 4/5

Bulgoki Bao Bun- the bulgoki was delicious and not overly sweet nor salty! The bun was a little on the blander side. If they sweetened the bun a little more, it would take it to another level!! 4/5

BBQ Chicken Bun- the bbq chicken was delicious! If you've ever had bbq pork from a Chinese resto, this is what it would taste like. But it was on the bland Bao bun. If that improved, this would be a higher rating! 4/5

Grilled chicken wrap- it was my friends dinner and unfortunately, I didn't get to try it! He sure seemed to enjoy it. 

Firecracker chicken- the broccoli was plain and steamed. The Rice was steamed and white. That left the chicken to shine through. And It would have, if the chicken wasn't so dry (couldn't chew threw the stringiness of the chicken. The sauce was very sweet but you got a slight kick from the spices. I also have a high tolerance for heat. If they reduced on the sugar in the sauce and made the chicken more juicy somehow, this would be s as perfect dish. 3.5/5

Hawaiian Fried rice- delicious fried rice and a generous portion size to feed 3 people. Want overly sweet and has nice chicken and pineapple chunks In it. 5/5

When I called to schedule my appointment I specifically said I am a black woman with natural hair and asked if anyone at this location knew how to do such hair. I was informed by Kelly who is apparently the manager that Donald would be able to do my hair and assist me with all of my needs. When I arrived for my appointment I specifically asked Donald again if he was comfortable with doing my hair and if he was experienced with doing natural hair, he said he was. He instructed me to go to the shampoo bar where he would shampoo and condition my hair and that is where this horrible experience all began. He started off by shampooing literally just the top portion of my very thick and natural hair and then he applied the conditioner to my hair without completely washing out the shampoo. Before completely washing out the shampoo or the conditioner from my hair he then told me to go sit in his chair to get blowdried. I was very confused and asked him specifically if that conditioner was a Leave in because there were still a lot of product in my hair. He then said oh no I have a leave in conditioner that I will use later. 
I told him that there was still conditioner in my hair and he said no he had washed it out completely. He began to blow dry my hair so I figured I would just trust him and let him do his job because after all he was ""experienced"". After he finished blow drying my hair he then began to reach for the flat irons when I almost pushed his hand very confused because my hair was still completely damp in the middle. I asked him what he was doing because my hair was still wet! He said he had tried his hardest to dry my hair and was going to begin to style my hair. I told him you cannot style my wet hair with a flat iron you will burn my hair off. By this point I was already so frustrated and so traumatized by this experience that I told him don't even flat iron my hair just continue to blow dry it and then trim my ends. He then tried to argue and tell me that my hair is already blow dried completely and that he can just trim my ends. At this point I knew that this would not get any better so I told him thank you for your services but this is a no. He then looked at me so confused as if I was in the wrong when I've been trying to work with him and not come off as an angry black woman but he clearly does not know how to style a black woman's hair. In the end I was able to speak with the assistant manager Angela, who was a black woman, who said that I could come back during a time where she would be available so that she could then do my hair, but apparently the day that I am scheduled to go back she gets Covid.

We contacted White Shanty immediately and explained the error and that we would have to pay a contra tor to do additional work to make the door ready.

Nobody ever returned a single call. The final call was handled by Michelle who said she went into Joes office and saw the refund form and that there was a lot of process to get that taken care of.

In the past 3 weeks I've had major issues with UberEATS from missing food, deliveries that are almost an hour past latest delivery time, to deliveries made to the wrong location and drivers not answering calls or vm to never receive the order.   

Can I just ask..... can a top Yelp elite make it to where we can review Uber?! Maybe then they can see the reviews that everyone else sees since they don't give you a number to talk to an actual person. Uber drivers have been far in between lately on service! 

Either way, I took my chance again and ordered sushi. The prices were ok. Not too high priced but the reason I tried this restaurant was because they had a buy one get one free deal on apps. I ordered the Captain roll which is supposedly the most popular roll. I was looking for a deep fried roll but this was close enough. Even after I poured on all the sauces, each piece held up and didn't crumble while eating. It was moist and lightly crispy. 

The apps.... I ordered the most popular item which is the deep fried avocado and coconut shrimp. The shrimp portion was to be expected. Ok in size but slightly over priced. They were crispy and delicious with the spicy Mayo and sweet chili dipping sauces. The popular deep fried avocado came in a heaping amount!! One order could easily be shared with 3-4 people! Each piece was cooked but still firm enough to hold, dip, and indulge! It was nice with the same sauces but think it would've paired better with a creamier aioli sauce or ranch. 

My overall experience was very satisfying! I got my fix with a TON of leftovers. This restaurant will definitely stay on my radar for the future! It's a must try! Next time I will go for entrees.",2021-01-03 01:47:59,378,1819,

They do not allow you to go back with your children to see the crappy work they are doing on them.  Can you imagine a little, scared girl going back with a huge male tech alone to have dental work?  Why is that even an ""office policy""?  So they can shove unnecessary procedures on you?  They were always trying to put sealants on every tooth and push extra work for more money. After continuing to say ""no to sealants"" and to stop asking, they made me sign a pre-written bill to my insurance company for 4 sealants stating ""Oh, I'll change the bill later"".  Hmmmmm. I'm guessing they claimed it anyway as why have me sign?
   
MY CHILD'S BAD EXPERIENCE WITH ""doctor"" LICETTE:  My daughter went in for two small fillings on teeth #29 and #31; the first two cavities/fillings in her life.  From the time she walked out she was in terrible pain for a week and they finally got her back in 10 days later.  She went in alone, as usual, to explain her pain.  We thought it was a tooth they worked on that was the problem, even though they were supposedly ""tiny cavities"".  I couldn't figure out how filling 2 tiny cavities could still be causing such terrible pain over a week later.  
My daughter walked out with a paper stating her formerly perfect tooth #30 (in between the #29 and #31 they had just worked on 10 days prior) was now infected, AND needed antibiotics, AND a root canal, AND they could NOT do it at their office AND she was being referred to a DENTAL SCHOOL in St Pete for dental students to practice their craft on her!!  What?!  I was upset.  Because they won't let the parents in, I called to speak to Licette Espinal but only got her incompetent assistant who didn't even sound like she knew how a tooth was even filled and kept insisting they ""never touched"" tooth #30 or even poked near it with a needle to deaden the other two teeth and swore no metal brackets were placed around the other 2 teeth to help build up the resin though the cavities were by the gum line and in between the teeth (dentally impossible).  I said,  ""There is no way a perfectly healthy tooth in your x-ray 10 days ago suddenly gets infected after Licette worked on it"" and could this have been from trauma to the gum during the filing of the other two teeth beside it.  She adamantly denied it again and again and said she needed a root canal. I told her I was going for a second opinion and asked for my daughter's x-rays.

Well, it seems that being questioned as to their dental work procedures made them do the most PROFESSIONALLY ETHICAL thing they could for the best interest of the child they affected/infected....they canceled her as a patient so they didn't have to admit guilt or help her!!!  Yep, I was snail mailed a letter that was written the very day I asked questions and told they will no longer be providing my daughter dental care.  How perfectly professional of you, Licette Espinal, to dump a child YOU caused dental trauma to simply because her parent needed answers to questions.  You took no possible responsibility for her pain/infection.  Don't worry, Licette, I wouldn't dare bring my child back to your dirty, sloppy practice.  And, by the way, YOU WERE WRONG as a ""dentist"" (and I use that term loosely for you now).  My daughter didn't need a ROOT CANAL!!  Nope!  Nothing was wrong with that healthy tooth. A second opinion and new x-rays at a skilled dentist showed it was just your shitty work that caused trauma to her gum and a VERY OBVIOUS protruding ledge of rectangular-shaped resin you left jutting out from the filing you did that was shifting tooth #30 and irritating her gum, especially while biting.  Thankfully a truly skilled dentist filed down the protruding resin of your sloppy work, and along with a round of antibiotics , he quickly took care of YOUR problem.  NO ROOT CANAL, infection gone, no more chronic pain!!  That simple!  Maybe if you would have considered my questions and taken a second look you would have found your mess.  So silly of you that you didn't see your own crappy work and figure this out when you x-rayed that very tooth the last time she was in your office chair, in pain, asking for your help on pain your caused her. 
 
Please parents, don't take your kids to this place.  If you can't sit in and see what a dentist is doing to your child, find another place.  Dental chairs are a fearful place for some kids and they should have their parents in, if more than a cleaning is needed.  Being my child's first filling and having all this go wrong with the prolonged pain, she now hates dentists.  Thanks, Licette! That's a shame considering you're suppose to be a pediatric dentist. 

*The only reason I would give this place ONE star at all is for the front desk assistant, Ruty, who obviously loves her job, is always upbeat, helpful and kind.  She is excellent!  Maybe Licette should take some ""customer service and care for the client"" tips from her.",2021-01-16 03:27:46,1031,4943,

When we sat down we noticed there were many other bigger tables so we asked to move to a bigger table. The hostess said that unfortunately every single table in the restaurant was filled. I looked around and said well maybe at the bar do they have a bigger table and she said unfortunately not even at the bar had a spot!!! Remember this was at 4 o'clock and no one was even in the whole restaurant  other than one other couple. Then the waiter was nice enough to ask the hostess to at least push two tables together. If they were following Covid guidelines the people that would have sat there would have been 1 to 2 feet next to us anyways so that table would have not been able to be used. She came to the table again and said she didn't think she could do that either but would check (rudely).  Well, she never came back. So after ten minutes the waiter just came over and pushed them together he said this is ridiculous to even have to ask to do so. Later people did arrive and the restaurant did have tables seated  but not even close to a COVID full capacity!

My boyfriend and I split the frites, yukon potatoes, broccolini, and flight of beef, which included 4oz USDA Prime, 4oz Grass Fed, and 4 oz Wagyu. At first bite all of them were delicious that I felt like I didn't even need to use our personalizations (Horseradish Cream and Chop Sauce). My favorite of the steaks was the USDA Prime because it just seemed to have the perfect texture and flavor combination. The others were top notch, don't get me wrong but the prime just stood out. The frites and the yukons were very good, but nothing completely mind blowing. I dipped my fries in our personalizations, which was a great combo. The broccolini had a sweet flavor, which I was not too fond of. I was expecting them to have a little more of a kick with the red pepper flakes and charring, so that was a little disappointing. Another reason for the 4 stars is that, even though our food came out at a perfect temperature, it seemed to get cold quite fast. By the middle of our meal, everything besides the yukons (which were in the dish they were baked in) were pretty cold. Don't get me wrong, the food was overall delicious, but with such a hefty price tag you'd think they'd be able to combat this with hot dishes that keep the food warm for at least half of our meal.

I thought the service was great and helpful. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about everything on the menu and our water glasses were always full.  I would come back, but skip the broccolini and just stick to the 7oz prime steak and try other sides.",2021-01-31 20:02:51,345,1620,

My wife ordered a Gypsy cocktail (Bacardi Limon, watermelon Schnapps, blackberry, sprite) and I had the Gulf Stream (Tito's vodka, grapefruit juice, cranberry juice, simple syrup, lime.)  We decided to split the Cracker Tower, which featured oysters, fish dip, and peel and eat  Shrimp.  The seafood was excellent and the presentation was wonderful.

For mains, we opted for Po Boys, one fried oysters and the other fried shrimp.  Both were terrific, packed full of flavorful seafood; and, large enough that we took half back to the hotel to have for supper. I had a draft beer with my meal.  My wife had another Gypsy.  

I also ordered a Kai Lani along the way (Mango Rum, Amaretto, Blue curacao, fresh lime juice, pineapple juice,) but, that part is a little fuzzy in my mind.

Firstly im from the uk ,my wife American we moved into the area nearly 9 months ago.
Zack was always extremely kind and pleasant which is why this senario is so upsetting, i come from a pub background in the uk, i served many people in Oxford Street in the west end of London, we loved going to brickies then all of a sudden i found some staff not as welcoming or wishing to serve us they'd be quite happy to leave us waiting, now im gonna express my wife is disabled and likes to take a comfy seat, but what has happened is just beyond me instead of communicating with me as im British and the cultural system is a bit different, the staff in brickies namely one bar man who never gave me or my wife the chance to redeem ourselves, literally stormed over to our table he is a guy in his forties he made us wait for 15 mins before having his outburst, Zack was in the tavern before this and was ignoring us, so Christmas eve he comes over the bar man and goes do you have a problem with some of the staff in here and i was shocked by his demeanor as we had been made to wait for so long for service so 2 gay women in a bar with an angry bar man we looked like we were being set up for pure embarrassment, i finally replied yes sometimes the service is a bit slow then he bitterly says ohh i have told zack what im doing .
He raises his voice and says you ate the worse tippers in the world by now i was defensive i said what he said well we get paid crap money and hour and you don't tip i was flabbergasted, i expressed look in the uk we don't have a tipping system there, and he instantly says well i told Zack whenever im working im not going to serve you he works 3/4 nights a week. He then walks off no nothing my head was spinning needless to say we left , i did want to talk to Zack but we felt so hurt,  i mean if this bothered him so much talk to me how the hell can you correct something if your just stone walled???
We had a i believed a genuine friendship with Zack but he treated us badly i nearly ran a bar in London and if you don't communicate with your customers then what does this say,the owners of the bar are so welcoming, our Christmas day was ruined with the notion of our custom meaning nothing and just to put the bar man straight im a British national here so i can't work, my wife works on a production line supports me financially we live in a motel so he probably earns more than my wife, he complains about money well at least you can work,to have no chance of defending ourselves we have had no choice but to write it here i loved brickies but now we feel humiliated and deeply saddened by Zack im an open person who believes in resolving conflict so yes brickies is amazing just make sure you leave a tip its just a very sad story i thought i would always be welcomed in brickies we do miss Zack and the atmosphere but to be treated like this is so upsetting",2021-01-01 17:22:08,647,3084,

Dang, I was just a kid when that movie and song came out!

Anyways, on to Jimmy's Express Carwash.  Went there in mid December because I hadn't washed my car in awhile. I'd been there before to get a car wash, but, decided to go back and try their $10 unlimited wash for a month. Wow, awesome deal! So first, I didn't know their hours and we got there literally like 4 minutes before they closed. I pulled up and apologized to the worker because I felt bad and asked if he could just go over the details of the special real quick and that we'd come back the next day to get a wash because, I knew he was getting ready to leave.  The nicest guy! He told me not to even worry about that. He went over everything and took his time. Told us all  the different wash plans and options and how the monthly promo works. He said it was fine if we wanted to sign up that day and  get a wash at the same time. Now mind you, by that time, they looked closed. We were the only ones there. Ok, sounds great!  He signs us up and thanks us. So we drive to the entrance of the wash. The same guy who signed us up runs over, guides us in and starts spraying and scrubbing down the car before we go through the wash. This guy was supposed to finish like 10 minutes ago and hes still hustling to make sure he gives us great service. Now, we really made use of that special and I can tell you this much, every single employee from there seemed like they had that same friendly, hard working, exceptional customer service as that guy that signed us up. Took my nieces everytime I went, because kids like going through car washes and the neon lights make it extra cool. Oh, and plus! Actually big big plus! They have free vacuums, towels, and glass cleaner after exiting the wash! Seriously? I'm serious! You kidding? Nope. Free? Free! Unbelievable! Believe it!

I went for a birthday celebration and there were 14 in my party. When i walked in there were 2 young ladies standing there whom I assume were hostesses and they greeted me very warmly.  
I was the first to arrive at 430pm and since they just open at 430pm wasn't anyone there yet so I went and took a mini tour of the place.
I must say it's really a nice quaint place they even have an upstairs. I can see going here fora romantic date. 
I was also surprised  because this is the first place i have been that had a machine that you walked up to...to have your temperature taken.
We were seated and greeted  by two men names Jake and Evan who said they will be taking care of us tonight and I must say they did a very good job, they had their plan of who was going to do what and everything ran smoothly, everyones fokd came out correct, nothing had tobe sent back...it was wonderful.
Now let me tell you about the food...1st I'm  so ashamed because we had drinks and appetizers and I was so busy eating and talking I forgot to take pictures of food items. 
I do want you to know to some this may be a pricey place you can spend anywhere from $40 to $150. 
They bring each table bread and butter and it's not your average bread to me it was like a roll and biscuit in one with some herbs on top.. i can truly say you can not eat just one.  I kept saying I am NIT going to get full on bread this was after the 3rd one.
They offer anything from soups, salads, seafood, chicken and steaks. 
They also offer desserts and have a big selection of mkxed drinks, wine and beer. 
Another thing I liked one they will let you split an entree, meaning me and my girlfriend split the chicken breast that came with 2 breast succotash and a,side of a creamy sauce.  It sold for $32. I was glad we split because neither of us are big eaters and even splitting we only each ate half of our breast. However I wished they would give more on the side, not because we split but because for the price it wasn't even enough for one in my opinion. I did get 2 spoonfuls and that was it. However if you split a salad its a lot...i did get a picture of that and the picture is when it is split. Everyone in my group enjoyed their food. I do want to give a shoutout to the manager Juliann because normally if you bring in a birthday cake they charge you a $25. Fee for cutting and a few of us were upset about that but even before we could address her she waived the fee...THANKS

What a horrible year for restaurateurs!!!! During the time that Pinefish shut down, a new Pop-Up called Comfort Philly appeared at the location, serving, what else? Comfort Food! I ordered meatloaf, and Mac and cheese (something I have been craving for the last week (since KeVen Parker, owner of Ms. Tootsie's soul food died (another wonderful local restaurant) , and they have temporarily closed, so very SAD)). The meatloaf was very good - not too firm, not too soft. Very flavorful. Served with a really nice, peppery gravy (which needs to be stirred when you get it home, prior to eating). It came with mashed potatoes, which were nice and creamy, but I could have used more, given the large serving of 3 good sized slices of the meatloaf. The menu on-line stated it came with green beans, but the photo reflected sautéed spinach - which is what I got, and loved. DH ordered 2 jumbo lump crab cakes - he thought they were terrific. They also came with sautéed spinach.  They were supposed to come with green beans, but he preferred the spinach they came with, as well.  No mashed potatoes were in the container, but he is on a low carb diet, so he didn't care (his would have subsidized my smaller portion, if they were provided). With that being said, I also got the Mac and cheese (that I noted above I had been craving). So, despite not getting exactly what we thought we were going to get, I ended up with LOBSTER in my super creamy Mac and cheese!  Being a New Englander, I, of course, LOVE lobster, so ultimately, we were both very happy, despite getting slightly different offerings than we anticipated. Remember, they had been closed for weeks, and had just gotten back in the kitchen.  I would say they did a fantastic job feeding us delicious, well prepared meals, given the terrible circumstances which they (and all restaurants) are dealing with. Having only recently moved into Philly, we had never been to Pinefish before, so we were eager to try their fare.

I walked up to the door were a large table displayed the menu. There was no indication if I should wait there or go inside. I decided to go inside. The cashier had his back to me as he was ringing in an order and didn't acknowledge me for 5 minutes. While I stood there awkwardly another lady came up to the screen door and asked if she was supposed to wait outside or inside. I told her I was unclear too. She came in and wasn't acknowledged either. Finally the cashier turned around and asked for our names. He said 4 Square (online ordering) was delayed and they're just getting the orders in. He didn't instruct us to wait inside or outside or in our cars. Due to COVID we all decided to wait in our cars. 
The two ladies inside with me had cars next to me and another person who came in after us and ordered all had their orders delivered to their cars and left. I went inside again and he fetched my order. By this point I'd been there for 30 minutes.

I called to in advance to make a reservation since we are living in the time of Covid. It probably wasn't necessary on a Sunday evening but better to be safe than sorry. 

The menu is extensive and I really had no idea where to begin. The waiter asked if we would like any recommendations and asked us what was calling to us...chicken, lamb or goat? I said I had  been thinking about goat and he pointed out 3 goat dishes. After describing each one I decided on the Bawarchi Special Goat Curry, large rice, and garlic naan. When the curry arrived I thought it looked rather small but we couldn't finish it. It was delicious and I was glad I got the large bowl of rice because it was a bit spicy.

My friend ordered a dosa. Again, I had no idea what that was but she described it as similar to a crepe. I assumed it was going to be small and thought she should order something else in addition. Nope! It was huge and pretty tasty. I wouldn't mind trying some different flavors. This one was chicken.

Although we were full, we had to try a dessert. They only had two choices this evening so we went with the Rasa Malai. It was a sort of rice dumpling served in a bowl of creamy deliciousness with some pistachios sprinkled in. We both enjoyed it.

Then my husband, the Korean bulgogi on pan fried noodles that was also flavorful, plenty, the veggies were cooked just right. The noodles had a great texture from the absorption of the sauce! I got the classic tofu soup (soondubu) which had some seafood and beef in there along with tofu. THIS WAS AMAZING. It was a cold day, we ate outside and it had me taking my layers off. You can pick the spicy level and I got the original which was not spicy but had a lot of flavor! It also came with kimchi, pickled daikon, side salad and a big bowl of rice!

We visited New Orleans and Florida between Christmas to New Years.  

We celebrated Mass at the Cathedral of St. Louis, which is a 5 minute walk from the Residence Inn.


In his homily, Archbishop Aymond shared that God calls us all to be holy families, saying I Love You and I Am Sorry.  

As we left, Mom asked the Archbishop to give us a family blessing and he did.




I have seen the Cathedral on a previous trip, but from the outside, at night.

During the day, the white exterior glows and inspires thoughts of heaven.

The interior has beautiful stained glass windows, created by a German company in the 1920s, which seem to tell the story of St. Louis the 9th (IX), King of France, including some of these parts of his life:

""He was born at Poissy, France, in 1214. His father was Louis VIII, and his mother was Blanche, .... At the age of twelve he lost his father, and his mother became regent of the kingdom. 

""From his tenderest infancy she had inspired him with a love for holy things.  In 1234, he married Margaret, the virtuous daughter of Raymond Berenger, Count of Provence, and two years later he took the reigns of government into his own hands. 

Source:  Catholic.org, ""St. Louis King of France""



""Even in childhood, his compassion for the poor and suffering people had been obvious to all who knew him and when he became king, it burst into full flower. Over a hundred poor people ate in his house on ordinary days and many more on holidays. Often the king served these guests himself.
...
Louis also gave generous gifts of money to poor people whether others considered them worthy or not. Monks and nuns, widows and prostitutes, gentlefolk fallen on hard times and minstrels too old or sick to perform, Louis gave happily to them all.
He also built hospitals and homes for those who needed them. 
...
""I would rather my extravagance should be in almsgiving for the love of God than in the pomp and vainglory of this world.""

Baldwin II, Latin emperor at Constantinople, felt deep gratitude to Louis for his generosity to Christians in the Middle East -- and, most likely, for settling some of Baldwin's own debts, too. In 1239, the emperor gave Louis the Crown of Thorns, said to be worn by Jesus on the Cross. Louis took his whole court with him to meet the Dominican brothers who brought the Crown to France. Then, to house this treasure, he tore down his chapel of St. Nicholas and built the lovely Sainte Chapelle.""

Saint King Louis wrote a letter to his son just before he died.  Some of the letter's advice includes: 
""""Fair son, the first thing I would teach thee is to set thine heart to love God; for unless he love God none can be saved. Keep thyself from doing aught that is displeasing to God, that is to say, from mortal sin. Contrariwise thou shouldst suffer every manner of torment rather than commit a mortal sin.
""If God send thee adversity, receive it in patience and give thanks to our Saviour and bethink thee that thou hast deserved it, and that He will make it turn to thine advantage. If He send thee prosperity, then thank Him humbly, so that thou becomest not worse from pride or any other cause, when thou oughtest to be better. For we should not fight against God with his own gifts.
""Confess thyself often and choose for thy confessor a right worthy man who knows how to teach thee what to do, and what not to do; and bear thyself in such sort that thy confessor and thy friends shall dare to reprove thee for thy misdoings. Listen to the services of Holy Church devoutly, and without chattering; and pray to God with thy heart and with thy lips, and especially at Mass when the consecration takes place. Let thy heart be tender and full of pity toward those who are poor, miserable, and afflicted, and comfort and help them to the utmost of thy power.
""Maintain the good customs of thy realm and abolish the bad. Be not covetous against thy people and do not burden them with taxes and imposts save when thou art in great need.""

We finally came across this one since it is on a major road that we travel and we thought we would stop in. Julio Carlos and HD we're great to work with. My sister gave HD the specs of what she was looking for and they came up with three vehicles in their system that we would be interested in. HD printed out all the specs on every one of them along with a Carfax which was great we took it home that night and looked over the information. We call back wanting to test drive two cars and they got them ready. Julio went with us on test drive we even took it out on I-10. She ended up with a 2012 Honda CRV very clean really nice vehicle the only thing that they needed to look at was replacing the windshield wipers. Which they did a few weeks down the line after they came in they even put them on and gave us a free wash. The financing with my sister went very smooth HD in financing knew exactly what she was looking for as far as payment and down payment. This was a one-owner car with excellent Carfax information. She felt very comfortable in knowing that it had been taken care of and it was a local Tucson dealership that did the work. Overall our experience with this location dealership was excellent I'm not sure about these other reviews but come on people it's a used car things happen. Do your homework. Thank you all the team over at this location on 1st.",2021-01-30 05:33:55,307,1478,

I should of said something a lot sooner but I have tried numerous times to give this company the benefit of the doubt. From day one it started. The installers showed up on time, dropped the windows off and proceeded to leave to go to another job. Fast forward to 3 o'clock that afternoon, they came back to start work. They finished up three windows and left for the day. The main installer, Jose, talked more than anything and did a horrible job when it was all said and done. I was told the job would be 2 days and it ended up being about 5. He put his thumb through two of the new screens. Also on day 2 they had me sign saying the work was completed so they could get there money. I should of denied that but I was put on the spot and unfortunately signed it. I didn't notice some of the capping wasn't caulked until a few days after the install, so I called up windows nation and they sent a service tech out. When the service tech came out, he saw the missing caulk but also noticed the poor capping job that Jose and crewed did. He took pictures and said he would have to get all of the work approved and would come back out. After what felt like two months, he finally came out. He fixed the capping around my front three windows and said he would have to be rescheduled to come back out. The day he was supposed to come back out I got a call and it was rescheduled. This proceeded to happen 3 more times. In December, yes 5 months after the install, a tech came out to fix all of our issues. Well the tech fixed most of our issues and said he would need another person to help him with the second floor windows. A month later and still no call to schedule. Fast forward to last week and I noticed a huge crack in my foyer window. Now this window is about 20 feet up so we didn't crack it. I called up last week, they asked me to take a picture of the window and the service sticker. Well there is no service sticker on the picture windows, so some one is supposed to call me to come out and assess. You mean to tell me you don't have the work order with my windows?  A week later and I still haven't gotten a call. I also did mention about the capping still not being completely done. This has been just about the worse customer service experience in my life. I also forgot to mention that the big window they installed in my kitchen is horrible. It's a picture window in the middle and a slider on the left and one on the right. Well I can't open it in the nice weather because I have little bugs easily getting in where the screen slides. So that means I would have a house full of bugs if I opened them. We were excited to have our new windows but have been completely disappointed with this entire experience. I took so long to do a review because I really don't like to complain and would of liked to give them the benefit of the doubt. Attached are pictures where you can see bugs and the cracked foyer window. At this point give me half my money back for all this aggravation. Either that or fix all my issues and replace this horrible kitchen window.",2021-01-26 23:38:47,679,3180,

When we arrived there were people spaced the part which I really liked since we are paying attention to Covid but still want to try to start eating out. Our waitress came up to us almost immediately and took our drink order and then asked if we know what we want. I said no thank you we need some time and she brought back waters and said do you know what you want do you order. I looked at her and she said OK let me give you a few more minutes.  Then when we were ready to order we couldn't find her anywhere. After 10 minutes I had the hostess who wants to see somebody get her for us.

We really wanted the ribeye (that they did not have yet at 5:30pm on a Friday night) because we had heard that they did it very well but also it's our favorite cut of steak.  We ordered the New York steaks instead. The cooks were able to cook it perfectly. Mine was medium rare and my friends was Pittsburgh style and they smelled and looked delicious. My friend had a problem with his steak knife not cutting the steak. Eventually I found a different waitress and ask for a new knife and that helped.  The steak flavoring and smell were great and the chimichurri sauce on top was amazing.

However this is a very nice restaurant and the steak was tough to cut and chew and each of us had to try to politely remove the tough piece of grizzle that could not be chewed.  We each only had one napkin, couldn't find our waitress or anyone else to get another and couldn't chew the fat that felt like bone.  Having to remove anything from your mouth is embarrassing, having to do it four times in a full napkin is horrible.

It's right around the corner from my friends condo so hopefully they will have a tender ribeye and we can give them another chance.",2021-01-16 10:41:46,381,1837,

I wanted 2 beef patties but they only had one beef patty left and the rest were chicken. So, I ordered the one beef and one chicken patty. The lady working gave me an extra chicken patty due to the beef one being kind of dried out which I truly appreciated. I ate the beef one in the car before I even got home and it was so good. Flaky buttery crust with a delicious filling inside. I ate a chicken patty at home and it was equally as delicious. 

They did not have ribs or oxtails which is what I wanted. So, I settled for the white meat jerk chicken. I ordered it dry and asked for a hot and sweet sauce on the side. I mixed the two together at home and it really made the chicken more flavorful. The sauces were really good, but I prefer the hot. The sweet by itself was too sweet for my palate,  but it was delicious mixed together. 

The cabbage was great. The plantains were not as ripe as I like them when I cook them at home. Now, the rice and peas? Bland. No seasoning. No flavor. 

I only ate half of my food and warmed the rest up the next day. I put butter in a skillet with the rice and peas and seasoned it with garlic powder, black pepper, cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes, a little Old Bay, Italian seasoning, and chicken bouillon. It was delicious afterwards. Like fried rice. 

I drizzled the chicken with the sauces that I mixed the night before, and put it in the oven with my last chicken patty. I warmed the one plantain and leftover cabbage in the microwave. It was all absolutely delicious the next day. The chicken patty was just as good if not better as well as the rest of the food. 

I will definitely go back for the patties alone, and hope to try their oxtails because the jerk chicken was just not the best in my opinion. If anyone has ever been to the Wild Hare in Chicago, you know what I mean. Their chicken is to die for. Locally, Jamaican Style Jerk is still my favorite. Their oxtails are so delicious. 

But, I will definitely give this place another try.",2021-01-01 23:09:11,455,2098,

I did make a reservation but remembered the time to be half an hour later than I requested (didn't write it down or put in my phone, duh). The manager kindly found us a spot anyway even though they were close to max capacity and totally booked in reservations for the rest of the night. (Note to management: in this day and age, digital confirmation/reminders are standard practice, and you did take my my cell number when I called. Getting the time wrong is totally on me but keeping people on track could be made easier for your own success and as a service to your customers.) It was very cold by the window, that is our only complaint of the entire experience! We enjoyed miso soup, yakiton, edamame and cucumber salad for appetizers included with our dinner. We had maguro, unagi and hamachi for nigiri, all delicious and tasted very fresh. For rolls: yoyo, golden gate, volcano, fuji mountain long rolls; and I had a spicy tuna handroll. My husband was surprised by how spicy the volcano was (lol); we would never go there without having the golden gate and yo-yo because they were so delicious! Fuji mountain lacked the crunch we like inside because it's a vegan tempura veggie filling - crunch just being our preference - so we'll try a different one next time. No dessert because we were stuffed. Next time we'll definitely have the Cajun tuna nigiri and Tundra long roll! Heads up: I like a little heat but felt everything with spicy qualities was a little ""extra"", we wiped hot toppings off onto the plate for some of them.

I typically shy away from wings that are simply tossed in a simple hot sauce, but something called to me this time.  The Jumbo Wings are tossed in Texas Pete, which doesn't sound alluring at all but once they arrived my opinion began to change. What sat before me were some of the meatiest wings I've had the pleasure of chomping down on.  They were juicy and had a great pull and the sauce was particularly aromatic to my senses.  I could have stopped eating after that as these guys were a beast with a nice crisp and I was particularly full, but Shane the bartender (who was more awesome than a ball pit full of puppies) had faith in me and supported my decision to dive into a burger with a side of onion rings, so after finishing up my 6 wings I diverted my attention to a particularly well manicured slop of beef between two happy little buns. 

It was incredibly good and I might declare this my favorite burger in downtown.  The meat temperature was exactly perfect and the pickled jalapeño toppings provided an incredibly nice crunch to my burger which had surprisingly fresh meat.

Without a doubt, this place does well and I highly encourage a visit if you're in the neighborhood.  I regret living almost a block away for 6 months and never visiting this place. Will be back for sure.",2021-01-13 20:06:37,305,1517,

I have two young kids and a husband who is a kid at heart. So fried chicken and fries is a common request for meals. Kay's has been on my list for a long time, and I'm glad I finally made the drive over.

Right now, it's takeout only, and they have a convenient ordering window, so you don't even go into the restaurant. I called ahead to reduce waiting time, and they told me to show up in 10 minutes. I did, and the food was ready about 5 minutes after I paid.

We ordered the fried shrimp, chicken wings, and chicken nuggets. We got them all as combos, some with fries, some with rice and beans. I didn't try the fried shrimp, but my husband said that they were great. The chicken wings were excellent. As mentioned before, they use a very light breading. It was very well seasoned. Sadly, some of the crispness was gone by the time I got home, but the flavor was great (I liked the sourness from the vinegar). The chicken nuggets were fine. I liked that they were pieces of whole chicken. The chunkier pieces were juicy. But they were generally pretty small, and the bone-in chicken was just better. The sides were all fine. The fries held up to the drive and were still crunchy after the 25 minute drive. The rice and beans were pretty good.

I have not physically been to this exact location but know the location very well. Fuzzy's is a local dive bar that if you were raised in the area you better know it well! Lol It's been awhile since I've been in this area so I'm assuming the restaurant hasn't been around for very long, but hope they become a stable to the community, especially in that location. This restaurant offers a very large variety of food on the menu that you would see more so downtown or beachside. The chef has created a higher end menu with very local prices. That is good for the customers but hope it doesn't hurt the survival of the restaurant. I don't know how they are pulling it off and surviving the location as well as the local customer service but I'm hoping they can stick around for many years to come. I viewed the Uber Eats app and they are now sharing black owned businesses which I've been advocating for awhile now as well as local small businesses during this pandemic. That's why I chose to check this place out. It didn't take but a few minutes of viewing the online menu that I wanted so many things and didn't know what to choose! I also saw specials that sound amazing. I broke down and ordered the shrimp and grits and Benedict cause they are my go-to. I couldn't pick and choose just one so I had to order both! I have so many positives but let me start with the negatives. 

This is for many restaurants... why not take the tail off the shrimp when served in a full meal?! I want to be able to dig in without work. The eggs were also lacking a little in size.... 

I have no other constructive criticism. This was an Uber Eats delivery for a 40 min delivery charge. Both meals delivered still piping hot! The shrimp Benedict was so unique being toasted on a croissant. It was very fancy. Everything about this meal was beyond expectations! I can only assume the presentation at the restaurant would give the high end look in a small strip restaurant. I also ordered the shrimp and grits which I've learned is NOT good for delivery. It's too messy..... except this restaurant obviously knows that! The container was wrapped tightly in saran wrap. No leaks, no mess! The meal was so different and very southern. Not your typical cheesy or buttery grits. This was very savory! Maybe a gravy mix or special seasonings?? I'm VERY judgy in my shrimp and grits since my first love for them went out of business. I can't even compare this entree cause it was so vastly different! And I LOVED it! It came in a heaping size portion that most couldn't consume in one or two meals. It was so different but so right! I've been on the search for the perfect replica of my love for shrimp and grits and haven't found it but I have now found the perfect new southern version of the home cooked feel of my favorite go-to meal. I definitely will be back and hopefully will try more on the menu that also had me intrigued! I hope this restaurant survives the location. If not, I hope they continue in another location even if they vamp up their prices to compare to their elegance. This restaurant shouldn't be over looked. I do fear the location for their survival but completely appreciate them bringing the high end to us locals at the local prices.",2021-01-09 17:02:52,700,3373,

Always a great selection of seafood, presented beautifully, and shopped daily so always fresh. I've seen complaints about the owner never getting back to people after complaints, and based on my own experience there must have been some sort of mix-up, because I've emailed them and gotten responses in less than 12 hours! They're ALWAYS busy, and the owner works alongside his staff, so I don't necessarily expect instant responses, but so far so good.

Re the prices: they're at or below the typical prices at other prime fresh seafood stores; they're typically a bit higher than a supermarket, but the quality, freshness, and selection make it worth the difference. I usually go for ""mid-range"" fish (in terms of price), but for Monday (my wife's birthday) I'm picking up some Chilean Sea Bass (now farmed, so not endangered) and Halibut. They're both at the high end of the price scale (in the few places that carry them regularly), but they're the Filet Mignon of fish -- particularly Halibut, which is like eating butter (but MUCH better for you :-) Just use a food thermometer so you don't overcook it, and it will melt in your mouth.

BTW, if you eat a lot of fish and DON'T have a food thermometer (preferably instant-read), you're missing the most important tool for a seafood aficionado. Used correctly (not rocket science), rather than guessing when your swordfish is perfectly done -- cooked through but still moist and fork-tender -- you'll KNOW exactly when to take away the heat, whether in an oven or pan, under a broiler, or on a grill.

The lengths Bacquet's goes to deliver exquisite cuisine in an upscale fashion is not only appreciated but respected.

Let's get down to business: My husband and I began our luxurious evening with a bottle of 2016 Chateau Blaignan Médoc ($48.00 a bottle, 55% Cabernet Sauvignon & 45% Merlot). I've only recently jumped on the Red Blend bandwagon (YES that's a thing), so my judgement is soft for now. But I can say I did enjoy each sip and the extra bite of flavor it provided. 

For appetizers, my husband ordered the French Onion Soup ($15.00). The menu accurately describes it as the ""best you have never had in your life."" The soup itself came covered by a thick layer of cheese that delivered an oh-so-freaking-satisfying cheese pulls. The taste was fantastic! A lot of flavor but not too onion-y. By far, best version of this soup I have ever had in my life. My adventurous self ordered the Escargot de ma Grand-Mere ($15.00), a Bacquet family recipe. Who knew snails could be so delectable! These were every bit as good as Escargot I've eaten in France and Germany. Truly authentic and a treat you can find this here in Boise. 

Moving along, we were getting full so agreed to share the Jambalaya (large black tiger prawns, andouille sausage, chicken, fresh vegetables sautéed in a deep, rich sauce with a piece of creole spices. Served with a blend of basmati and wild rice, $34.50). This dish fell a little short of my liking. I really haven't eaten much Creole food so I don't feel qualified to criticize it, but this just wasn't for me. There wasn't a lot of flavor, a couple drops of hot sauce could have amplified it. I personally would not order this dish again, however I wouldn't NOT recommend it because to the more experienced tongue this might be it! 

Their menu is full of other delicious European dishes. Also, someone remind me to go easy with the appetizers because I really wanted to try some dessert but was way to stuffed. Our total before tipping came too $115.00. If you know fine dining, then you agree is a hell of a deal for a high-end experience. Not to mention the white-glove service is on point! Neither of us had to refill our own glasses of wine. Wonderful servers with fantastic training. 

Thank you Bacquet's for bringing fine-dining to the Treasure Valley! I will repeat that you have my full appreciation and respect for the outstanding food, service and atmosphere. Can't wait to be back!",2021-01-23 16:07:50,529,2551,

Nine Lives Cat Cafe is a tiny little place in Fountain Square that is a cat lovers paradise. You walk into the Cafe and it's broken into two main spaces. The first is the beverage area and the second is the ""Cat Room"". You can order essentially any coffee beverage that you could think of as you wait for your allotted time in the cat room!

When you enter the cat room, you are welcome to take your jackets and purses off to hang in the entryway. You then make your way through the double doors and get to hang out with all of the cats! The cats at the Cat Cafe are all up for adoption, so you have free reign to play and get to know the cats! When we went, there were around 12-15 cats in the cat room, around 7 of those being younger cats/kittens and around 6 of them being adult cats. We were in the cat room with four other individuals but there was more than enough space to social distance. 

I loved just sitting on the ground and letting the kittens zoom around me! It was so fun to watch them play with each other and with the various toys they had around the room. I was excited to see that one of the couples in the room with us decided to adopt a cat at the end of the session!

Though there is a cost to reserve a time, all of the proceeds go towards the Cat Cafe! This place is great for a chill hangout with some cool felines, I will definitely be back again in the future!

Pro-Tip: Reserve your cat room time online instead of walking in! During the mid-day, times are pretty open, but when people start getting off work the times really fill up. Reserve your time online before going to make sure that you don't miss out on a spot!",2021-01-15 15:47:23,373,1726,

The place itself is nice and the server was fantastic; I forgot his name but he was blond and on the younger side. The drinks were amazing, we had 5 old fashioneds. The food was where everything went downhill. We had high expectations for the dinner  after the Nigiri we had for the starter which was very good but then came the second course, ceviche was good; grilled artichokes were inedible, burnt, and very tough; the Caesar salad was not elevated at all (especially when you're spending $750 for dinner and drinks). For the main course we got steaks and scallops. My partner and I ordered Medium rare ""Center-cut Beef Tenderloin"" but when it came we ended up just carving the outside to eat it because it was borderline rare/raw. The scallops were cooked perfectly but were fishy and therefor not so fresh. For dessert we all got the creme brûlée and that was complete trash, none of us took a second bite. It was watery and tasted very bland and actually repulsed me. I think we didn't say thing at the moment because the drinks and server had us in good moods and it was NYE but I wouldn't recommend coming here and spending $750 on a dinner and drinks for 4 and having mediocre food. I preferred the Hattie B's hot chicken and local beers that I had the day before for like $50. Shout out to the server! I would probably come back on a normal day and give this place a chance.

In every instance of basic questions and support requested, it left us with the opinion the people responding to the request did not work for the organization, or were not well trained or informed to support their customers. After receiving our door and determining we had several concerns we called customer service. We were told managers were busy and did not have time to talk with us. We were told someone would return our call later in the day and we have never received a call. We ordered a non-assembled door and that was a huge mistake on our part. We do feel it was not explained very well and the pre documentation received, did not support the headaches we would incur. The first issue we had the instructions to assemble our door were not included. We later found out there were none and we were provided a general assembly instruction that did not support our door. Next if you order a non-assembled door, make sure you have the ability to rout your door as they do not provide the routed opening to install a recessed handle in the door. The screws provided to install the cross panels were unacceptable as we ordered a ""white door"" called a Charleston and they provided black screws for the assembly. Sarcastically, we were eventually told if we wanted white, paint them. Next, the handle on the outside of the door was not acceptable. Based on their recommendation of installation, it is required to have a spacer under one side of the handle that was not provided. When we finally got a hold of someone in customer service to help us, they committed to having a spacer shipped to us, of course we have never received (holding 3 weeks later). In our opinion the handle as simple and basic as it was it could have been formed or made with the proper length required based on their recommendations. Whenever we call everyone is always in a meeting and not available and never returns the calls. Last if you order a not assembled door make sure you have a good drill, steel drill bits, you will need more than one to drill your holes in the slider bar for your door. This may be required assembled or not assembled to locate your hole in the bar to match your studs or preferred mounting configuration.

Everywhere we could think of was showing that they were closing in a few minutes. I was honestly getting a bit hangry and just ""over it"". We just knew what we did NOT want that night. Suddenly my hubby thinks about BJ's. 

We have been here from time to time and have always enjoyed it. I especially remember amazing food when I was working out of the home and part of my job was setting up events and dealing with some caterers. One of my bosses (and I) totally loved having BJ's cater for his events. It was always super tasty, well-received by all, a great value, and they were easy to work with. This was way back in the early 2000's when they were still over in that little hole in the wall location at Prater and McCarran. Thinking about the ""old days"" made me instantly agree.

We called in our order and it was almost ready when we arrived. It was an easy process and there were several others who had the same idea that evening.

We were taking it home and needed three meals. We all got Barbecue Platters. Among the three meals (all of ours different), we had some Pork Ribs, Pulled Pork, BBQ'd Chicken, and Sliced Beef Brisket along with BBQ'd Beans, Macaroni N Cheese, Coleslaw, Hand Cut Fries, and Cornbread.

My favorites were the Pulled Pork, Pork Ribs, BBQ'd Beans, and the Cornbread. I wish I would have asked for extra sauce, though. Being raised on Kansas City Barbecue, I like mine flavorful and dripping all over. You know, the kind that makes you use a ton of napkins... 

I am not a huge fan of Cornbread, because it is often too dry for me, but theirs was wonderful.

We also ordered the KickAss Fries. Oh my! Just the smell of them on the way home was driving me bonkers. It was even stronger than the BBQ smell. These things are crazy tasty! 

Next time, I could easily just order these KickAss Fries and maybe even get a bit more Pulled Pork on the side (you can buy it by the 1/2 pound or pound). Or maybe just go on a KickAss Wednesday and get the Crazy Ass, which is a 1/2 order of KickAss fries with two pork ribs, a pork slider and BBQ sauce.

After looking on Yelp to read the reviews for Sandwich spot, I discovered the owner is super rude to anyone leaving honest...less that exemplary...reviews. Which really turned me off to wanting to try them. So I looked at Tealeaf instead.

Here I was thinking they only did boba, to discover they do so much more! I ordered the Shrimp fried rice, A boba Thai tea, and a Báhn mì aka bbq pork sandwich.

Part of the reason for the 4 stars, is while I was waiting for my order, another girl game in. She ordered and suddenly the boy at the register asked her if she had a punch card. He didn't ask me if I had one, nor if I'd wanted one. I was sad because I'd have taken one.

The food was fast and soon I was out to eat in my car. The  sandwich was phenomenal. It had so much flavor. The meat was delicious and thick with a sticky sweet Chinese bbq sauce going on that was to die for. It had shredded carrots, cucumber, jalapeño and cilantro on a super fresh and warm baguette. 

The other reason for the four stars...the fried rice was terrible. I was so sad to see there were no veggies. Only onions that weren't cooked enough for me which was a turn off, and a few shrimp that seemed to be added on after. It was literally rice, egg and onion with a few shrimp. Didn't seem to have enough soy sauce. No bean sprouts, or peas, or carrots or anything. I was so unimpressed I didn't even eat it. 

The Thai Tea with boba was good. The boba were cooked well, and it was pretty standard. I'll try the brown sugar one next time.

Besides the terrible rice, I'd definitely try their food again, and try other things. The Báhn mì was so good that it's worth coming back just to get it.",2021-01-08 18:02:48,406,1807,

To start, ""Mikey"" was working the counter.  Apparently, some women he knew came in, so rather than waiting in the line like everyone else, he just lets them waltz right up to the front and takes their order.  I almost walked out at that point, but I was so hungry that I decided to wait.  That was yet another mistake on my part.

After taking my order, since there are no chairs, benches, or anywhere at all whatsoever to use while waiting, you just stand there near the counter waiting for your order.  When my order comes up, a short male worker threw two of my three slices I order up onto the counter and immediately walks away.  I had to mention to ""Mikey"" that I ordered three, and they act like I'm being a nuisance asking for my third slice I paid for.  So, about 20 seconds later, another slice is thrown up onto the counter.  It almost slid off the freaking plate it was on and onto the counter top itself.

In case this wasn't bad enough, there were none of the staple toppings (red pepper, garlic powder, Parmesan cheese, etc.) anywhere in sight.  Since the guy who threw my pizza across the counter took off before I could get his attention and ""Mikey"" was busy flirting with some other women again, I didn't have anyone I could even ask for them.  So, I cut my losses at that point and left.

To add, I'm from NY.  This pizza was not even remotely close to NY pizza.  It wasn't horrible, but certainly not worth the price I paid for it.  I strongly suggest if you're craving pizza, go to the one in Ybor.  It's right down the road from this one and SO much better.",2021-01-31 07:21:23,370,1672,

My dog had what seemed to be a neurological episode for the first time. I was terrified of course so I took him to Blue Pearl. I called their emergency line when we were 60 seconds out and was told I had to hang up and call another number when we pulled into the parking lot, because they couldn't transfer calls. I did that but was kept on hold for several minutes. My dog was still shaking and acting strangely so I walked up to the building and asked that he be seen, since nobody was answering the call that they made me make. Finally a nurse came to get him and took down the info I had. He came back to the car after a checkup- I received no information on the results, and was told to wait in my car and the vet would call in 10 minutes. 30 minutes later, I had still not been called so I called again. I was told the vet was working on an animal going through an emergency and couldn't call right now. I understood so asked if I could leave (I had class) until she called or if it was unsafe for my pup. After a lot of confusing mixed messages, the vet tech finally told me he could go home for now. 3 hours later, I still hadn't gotten a call from the vet- at this point I still had absolutely no idea what was happening with my pup (I didn't even know if it was safe for him to eat dinner). I called again and spoke to Megan on the phone. She told me the vet was now on another call and couldn't speak to me. I told her I was frustrated because the immediate emergency with the other animal was now over and I still haven't received any information on my dog's emergency. In an extremely condescending tone she said ""that's not how emergency medicine works."" I recognized that I wouldn't be getting any info so I asked that the vet call me ASAP. Finally, after more than 3 hours, the vet called again. She asked all the same questions I'd already gone over with the nurse, was immediately short with me, and at the end of the day didn't have any solid recommendations other than he would need more tests for a diagnosis. I asked if they'd be able to send the records to his primary vet in the morning, and was told (even though I didn't ask for them to be sent any sooner) that they didn't have time to send them tonight but would in the morning? What was interesting, however, was that despite having no time all evening to answer the phone, see my dog, provide information, or send vet records- my INVOICE was sent within 5 minutes of getting off the phone!

Because of Covid, we selected outdoor dining at 5pm. The restaurant now has a small patio. It overlooks the Embassy Suites, sure, but they have a handsome front, so that was fine. But the view of the mountains as the sun went down was amazing.

Our server was Randi, and she was the best. Attentive, funny, charming, and warm, Randi ensured our experience was everything you'd expect from a restaurant of this caliber. But what about the food?

We started with drinks (Manhattan for me, prosecco for her, both fantastic) and shared the carpaccio. It was great. The dish was perfectly prepared, and the crustini couldn't be beat.

We skipped salads and moved to the entrees and sides. She ordered the filet (medium rare ""plus"") and I ordered the bone-in ribeye (medium rare). We ordered the Fleming potatoes and the mushrooms as sides. Both were delicious. The steaks? Hers was perfect. Mine, however, came out medium. The steak had turned from being a delicious steak towards being roast beef. Hey, it happens. When I asked Randi for her opinion, she heartily agreed and had the kitchen re-do it. So I shared her filet while we waited for the replacement. They did it in a hurry and it was cooked to perfection. Amazing and delicious. So we noshed on that after her filet, enjoying it with a bottle of Merlot from Napa. (Pricey, but reasonably above retail.) 

We still had wine left when it came to dessert--the chocolate lava cake. It was fantastic. We ordered a glass of 20-year tawny port to go with it (and the rest of the wine) and it was terrific. 

Matthew, the manager, came by the table to make sure we were okay with the steak change. Of course we were! And, it turns out, he comped us for our before-dinner drinks, something he simply did not have to do. So I pumped the amount back into the tip because the service was A-One.

Flemings is, in my humble opinion, pretty high-end. But if you're willing/able to do it, you get everything you pay for. This was our second visit to this location (third overall) and we could not have been more pleased.

When shopping for our new couch, Sam Levitz provided an easy experience. The sales rep gave us our space and we were able to look around without feeling pressured. Once we found what we liked, placing the order was quick and simple. 

This is where our great experience stops. We paid for this couch in full back in October. We were told that it would not arrive until mid November due to holidays and Covid, which we were disappointed by the wait time, but we understood. To this day (January 8th, 2021) we still do not have the couch. We have not received any updates for the couch. The only way we found out about the delays was to call in ourselves and wait in the egregious call line. Each time the support rep asked ""you didn't get notice your order has been delayed?"", because apparently we were supposed to get a call every time this happened, yet this has not occurred once.  It has been delayed 4 times at this point: delayed from end November to mid December. Delayed from mid December to end December. Delayed from end December to early January. Now delayed from early January to mid January. When we asked what they could do to appease our situation, they simply claimed it was out of their hands. 

We're out a couple thousand and still here without a couch. At this point, we don't even know if we'll get the couch we loved, but we're too nervous to back out because we keep getting promised it's around the corner.

Ordered online a few meals. Normally we have good experiences here.  Went to pick them up, brought them home. And realized the chili was missing.  My fault for not checking the bag first, sure. Lesson learned yet again.

My issue isn't the simple mistake, but it is the response I got after I returned to the business.  After explaining on the phone that the bag was left for me on an ""online order"" (I was honestly told that I took it before someone could tell me that they were out of chili...), and that it was clearly left unfulfilled, I expected something courteous when I drive back.

2-3 people discussed quietly behind the counter who was going to work with me. I am assuming, since they spoke quietly and kept looking at me. Very awkward.

Worked comes to the counter, and this is what I got: ""We're out of chili. What would you like instead?""

After the food was prepared and brought to me, the comment was, ""Here ya go.""

At no point was there an apology. No attempt to compensate my food, no attempt to offer a complimentary desert. Literally, no apology. No ownership of what they did that caused me to make a return trip.

We knew nothing about this restaurant and the service. We were served our water and about 10 minutes later the waitress stops by and rambles on about how the service works. We ordered our drinks which took about 30 minutes to receive. The Lemon drop was ok but one of their signature drinks was horrible. Way too much rum and just didn't taste like the recipe should have tasted. I believe it was the Rio Sunrise. 

You ordered your salad by marking a piece of paper which is different since you can't serve yourself at the salad bar. The salad was good.  Next came the meat served by the ""Gauchos"". The beef was way too under cooked. We like med to med well temp beef and you had to cut the raw meat away. The chicken wrapped with bacon was decent and I thought the lamb was tasty. Next the waitress served a cinnamon sugar cooked banana and garlic mashed potatoes which were utterly disgusting. Mashed potatoes are not hard to make from scratch and to use instant potatoes is unacceptable. 

The wait for the next Lemon drop was at least 20 minutes. There were two bartenders at times and the restaurant wasn't that busy. By the time we were ready to leave we couldn't find our server to pay for our meal. We finally took our tab up the the hostess station and she was nowhere to be found either.

We were beyond excited to try a local BBQ eatery since there doesn't seem to be many around. My boyfriend spent a handful of years living in Alabama so he was looking for some southern comfort and, of course, has some high standards for the cuisine.

We ordered quite the array of food since everything sounded so tasty. 

To start we got the candied bacon and the Red Neck Egg roll. The bacon was by far my favorite thing we ordered. A perfect salty-sweet combination and the bacon was thick and tender. Melts in the your mouth! The egg roll was large in size (one is more than enough if you're sharing it as a starter) and packed big flavors from the pulled pork and Q sauce flavors, but it was a bit too greasy. I didn't finish my half for that reason.

We're a sharing couple, so we got the pulled pork sandwich (with coleslaw) and the shaved brisket platter.

The sandwich was delicious! The pork was very nicely cooked, but it was missing the sauce we requested. Our order came with some BBQ sauce so we did dip the sandwich in that for a little extra flavor. I'm a coleslaw fanatic and this one was TERRIBLE. Such a let down! Literally no flavor at all. 

Onto the brisket platter! The brisket was quite dry but the flavors were solid. For our two sides, we chose the pit beans and corn bread. 

The beans were smothered with pulled pork, onions, and peppers. Absolutely delicious! If you've noticed the trend- This establishment has nailed their pulled pork items.

The cornbread though? WOOF! A total letdown. It was like you just went hiking through a desert for 8 hours with not a single sip of water. That's how dry this large square of bread was. My boyfriend compared it to sawdust and he's right on the money. I tried to save it with the butter, but the most it did was slightly hold it together better. No bueno!

The new owners don't seem to have a handle on what's happening there since they are only there one day a week, nor do they seem to care.  My 4 year old husky/lab  became ill on Tuesday morning 1/12/21. She didn't want to get up and or bear weight on her rear right leg.  I let her rest but she was really lethargic the remainder of the day. I called FPH and they weren't seeing patients that day, so I scheduled for the following morning.  That evening I ended up at an Emergency pet hospital, where they said she had a low fever, pain and swelling in that rear ankle and the front left wrist. They recommended starting with a tick snap test and CBC panel. They also recommended aspirating her joints to test the fluid in them for auto-immune diseases. We ran the snap test and it was negative and her bloodwork fine.  I decided to wait on aspirating her joints so that I could follow up with her vet the following day at the scheduled appointment.

On Wednesday I took her in and Dr Done said that she still had a fever and was dehydrated. She suggested an IV of fluids, non-steroidal injection for inflammation and possibly x-rays, but she said not to do that now because she seemed to be presenting pain in other joints from what she displayed the night before and I would need to do several x-rays and she didn't think it was worth it at the time.  So we did the IV of fluids and injection. That morning when I dropped her off, she pooped outside Foothill pet hospital so I gave it to them to test, since she had drank creek water up Jesusita trail the day before. The tech that took her back said that was a good idea and took the stool to Dr Done.  The stool sample was never tested!

They asked that I bring her back the next day for another IV of fluids. I took her back on Thursday and that day she saw Dr Ofesprey (?). He called me to go over what had been taking place only to cut me off halfway through my explanation and tells me he's going to check with their internist and get back to me.  I asked him if he wanted to let me finish telling him what was taking place and he said no, I'll call you back. Later an assistant called me back and informed me that they wanted to do a more comprehensive tick test. Every question that I had, she put me on hold to ask Dr O!  I said, ""wouldn't it be easier if I talked to the dr directly?"" She never put me through to the Dr. We went ahead with the next tick test, which I was told I would have the results in 2-3 days.  The following day, Friday 1/15 my dog was getting worse. She didn't want to get up at all and hadn't even gone out to go to the bathroom or eat. So I called FPH to talk to a vet. No one returned my call. I called again on Saturday, no vet returned my call.  Mind you I am actually speaking to someone at their office, so I am leaving messages with a live person! I also asked that the owner and vet my dog had seen previously, Dr. McCorkle call me to discuss her treatments. No call back. I called again on Monday again requesting to talk to Dr. McCorkle and was told that she was booked all day and not in again until the following Monday, so that is when she could call me!   WHAT? One week later? They also said that in their opinion she is spread too thin between her other practice and this one!  Well then she shouldn't have two practices, especially if she's only at this one one day a week and can't talk to her patients owners! Now I am getting upset! My dog is getting worse by the day and her vets won't call me back, recommend other ideas, tests, nothing!  And the test results weren't in yet!  I called again Tuesday, no test results, no vet call. On Wednesday I called again and was told by the manager to bring her back in for fluids, six days later someone (not a vet) makes a recommendation!  Wednesday afternoon Dr Done called and suggested I see a specialist and that they were unable to help her!  Again, ONE WEEK LATER!  Why didn't they suggest that on Friday?  I told her that I am sure Dr. McCorkle will respond once I give my review!  Then the next day Dr O called and tried back-peddling and trying to give some advice! Thank you but no thank you.  7 days later isn't patient care! It is the opposite! Non-patient care!   I will never set foot in their office again. They even charged me for items that I didn't approve, which I have now received a refund for.  They don't seem to care or have the time that it takes to properly care for your animals. Your animals that are like your children. You love them, would do anything for them and they are your companions. Especially in times like these.  

Oh and still no call from the owners!  That is unacceptable!",2021-01-25 19:42:38,1045,4837,

What kind of an animal am I if I opted for the thin crust pizza, and then left a three-star review? These are the questions that are currently swirling through my head as I leave a three-star review for Lou Malnati's. But according to Yelp, three stars means ""A-OK,"" and that's how I feel about my pizza. It's A-OK. So, take my review or leave it: My feelings for Lou Malnati's are not as deep-seated as some people I know who grew up with this pizza and love that it finally came to central Indiana. I do love that it came to central Indiana, though. I love that it gives so many people so much pleasure. 

My review is based solely on the thin crust pepperoni pizza. Yeah, this pizza was not my jam. It was fine, and I felt full afterward, but it wasn't for me. The thin crust is cracker-like and yet greasy, and the pizza is cut into squares. Just ... no. I know some people love pizza that is cut into squares, but I'm not one of those people, and I'm immediately turned off when I see a circle cut into asymmetrical squares. Even my son, who loves pizza more than almost any food, said that this pizza was not his favorite. That didn't stop him from eating 1/3 of the pie (he is a growing boy, after all), but I feel like he probably would have eaten 1/2 of the pizza if it would have been a little better.

The one thing that I did like about the pizza is the sauce. It was delicious and tangy. They got the sauce right, so point for that. Actually, now that I'm thinking more about that sauce, I'm wanting it again, so maybe that's why people love the deep dish version so much: because there's so much sauce in it. (Now I'm really regretting not getting the deep dish. I never said I made smart food decisions, people.)

You should know that this location is currently not offering dine-in service. You can only get your pizza to go. But they make it very easy to order your pizza online (or by phone) and then drive up and have someone bring it out to your car.",2021-01-08 00:00:34,465,2058,

It seemed like they forgot to add masala(spice). I had similar experience at  Bawarchi's location in sparks so it's not a one off thing. This decision of not adding enough spices to the rice and vegetables while preparing biryani must have been taken at corporate level. They probably want to just make the most bland biryani rice which is not spicy for anyone. If anyone wants spicy and not bland food they just hand them green chillies. At this point I would recommend Trader Joe's frozen but flavorful biryani over this bland bawarchi biryani.

I remember how happy I was and how often I used to go to this place when it first opened because unlike other Indian restaurants this restaurant didn't ask for a spice level. They just served authentic indian spicy food especially Biryani. If you feel the heat they do provide Raita to cool it down and that's how biryani is supposed to be. Hot and spicy biryani with chilled Raita(yogurt) to cool it down.

Today when I went there for Hyderabadi Veg Dum Biryani, they didn't ask for a spice level and so I clarified I want the authentic spicy Biryani. The server just reheated the regular bland biryani and told me to add some sambhar if the biryani is not spicy for me. It was bland and adding sambhar doesn't make it spicy. Also it had hardly any vegetables. It was just bland rice. He even checked on me and when I told him how biryani is not spicy he told me all he could do is provide some green chillies. I don't understand why he would think adding green chillies would make the bland biryani flavorful. There is difference between spicy and flavorful. I don't want to just eat hot green chillies with rice when I said I want spicy authentic indian biryani. I want food that is not bland. I agreed since it was better than that bland rice. 

I am never going back to this place since the food here is completely white washed at this point. If you can't handle even a little bit of spice and are okay with bland food then this might be the place for you.
For anyone looking for authentic indian food, you are better off staying away from this place. Trust me and get something from Trader Joe's. It's not very hot, spice is manageable for most people and it is definitely not bland.",2021-01-27 06:51:44,483,2377,

They left my door unlocked, which they could have just turned the lock on the door knob from the inside before they left. I was not happy with the cleaning service at all. The microwave, the oven, the fridge, the windows, and the ceiling fans were not touched. I could not tell if they cleaned the tub or shower, but the toilet bowls were still filthy. I called to complain and all they could offer was for someone else to come out and finish the areas they didn't get to. I replied they did not get to anything.

That is why I'm giving 3 stars instead of one. It was so amazing to have wonderful, flavorful, South Indian food locally. Then we had a baby and then Covid hit. We have gotten takeout from here a couple of times during the pandemic and just become increasingly disappointed. I didn't write a review based on our last experience, and I don't remember really well so I'll just base this rating on our most recent experience.
It was a Friday or Saturday night and we called in our order just as they were opening for dinner. The gentleman who took my order was nice but I did have to wait on hold, no big deal. He got my order: a Briyani, paneer tikka Masala, a dosa, an appetizer, some rice, naan, and Raita. The total was $50 something. We were hopeful our last experience had been a one-off. We were quoted 45 minutes. We arrived at 40 minutes and checked in. He chuckled that I was early and was told he'd let me know when our food was ready. We waited in the car. We called at 15 minute increments and after an EXTRA 45 minutes waiting in the parking lot with a now very hungry, bored and cranky toddler, our food was finally ready. He walked it out with an quick ""sorry about the wait"" and that was that. If this was me during my years in food service and I had been working with some great management, I would've comped something or taken a percentage off their bill just based on the wait. 
We got home and dug in, starving. The chicken in the briyani was lacking flavor. The sauce that goes with it was missing. They did get the rice right. The Tikka masala was also bland even with the addition of salt it just didn't have the typical flavor. The dosa was packaged separate from the filling, likely to keep from getting soggy- which is great, but it was so burnt it was inedible. The fried appetizer was ok but it was cold. The raita tasted like water. The only things we were able to enjoy were the rice in the briyani and the side of rice. Even the garlic naan was blah- maybe because it was cold or a bit stale. 
We are so sad about the loss of one of our favorite restaurants. They were super busy that night so we wonder if others had the same experience, or just don't know how good it could have been.",2021-01-23 16:10:15,497,2296,

I don't have to touch any pens or waste any time when I get there to do that.  As I'm driving there, I get a text with a link that tells me to click on that to let them know that I'm there.  When I get there, I do that on my phone, go through the same stuff I already filled out at home, which was a little annoying, and then get no further instruction.

Here's where I give you my advice:  DO NOT GO HERE FOR COVID TESTING IF YOU ARE ASYMPTOMATIC, OR NEED A TEST FOR WORK.  They only do COVID testing during certain hours and you are made to wait in a lobby with people who are obviously sick.  They should have a sign at the door to let you know this.

I decided to pop in to check out The Niche, which is located at the Legends Outlets in Sparks. 

The staff were polite and helpful in clarifying which products in the store were on sale or not. They told me that there used to be a handful of Niche locations, but were now just down to two--the one in Sparks, and one in Truckee, which was good to know if I ever take a visit out there in the future. Both employees were both wearing face masks, with one of them also wearing an additional face shield. They had hand sanitizer, but only at the register.

The Niche has women's clothes AND household decor and other little trinkets, making this a good place to buy something for yourself or find a gift for a friend. As it is a boutique, the clothing is a little more pricier than the alternate mass produced clothing shops like H&M and Forever 21, where you also sacrifice quality for a cheaper price. However, you are supporting local, which I find is better, especially during the ongoing pandemic. 

At first glance, I thought the clothing was pretty boho-chic, but was happy to find something in my style. I ended up buying a casual black/grey tie die shirt as well as a nice black cami that can certainly be dressed up or down. There didn't seem to be a fitting room to try anything on, but thankfully the tops fit nicely and were made of very soft material.

They are absolutely disgusting, inadvertent, and HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO CARE FOR YOUR ANIMALS. 

AFTER THE TORTURING AND  ATROCIOUS lack of ""care"" for our dog, ( he came out of there with tucked tail, bruising and an skin infection from laying in his own poop and pee,
we not only had to rush HIM to our regular vet THE NEXT MORNING after taking him home because we had the hospital administrator calling us telling us that our dog was doing amazing and responded to their treatment and he could go home. MY BOYFRIEND HAD TO KEEP OUR DOG ALIVE BY SHAKING HIM OUT OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS Waiting for the vet to open, while he laid on my lap peeing himself and a had secretin coming from him that smelled like ROTTEN DEATH. 
WHEN PICKING UP OUR DOG AND STANDING AT THE DOOR WAITING FOR HIM TO GET BROUGHT OUT, NOT ONLY WAS HE DRAGGED MY HIS NECK ON A LEASH BUT THEN KICKED IN THE BUTT TO GET OUT OF THE DOOR, while shoving a bag into my fiancées stomach telling him the directions are in the bag. 

HOW ARE THESE INDIVIDUALS VETERINARIAN'S when they can't even hold up the one thing they are sworn in to to do, their OATH.

THIS DOES NOT EVEN SCRATCH THE SURFACE  OF WHAT WE WENT THROUGH, but I'm so thankful he FINALLY received the care he needed and some. When your love for you animals is so great and they can feel and know it, trust me they will fight for you.
Second chances are hard to come by and a lot of people who bring their animals to them don't get that.

During my most recent experience, Joanne and Thu did the pedicures for my boyfriend and I. (Side note: Thu does my pedicure every time I come in and she gives the best massage, and her attention to detail is amazing!) 

The salon is very clean: We sanitized and washed our hands upon arrival, the pedicure chairs are sanitized after every customer, and the foot bins have disposable plastic after every use. Everyone in the salon is so friendly and kind. Joanne makes great conversation, and makes you feel truly welcome! My favorite part about the pedicure is the massage. There is no pedicure place that I have ever been to that does a massage as good and as long as this salon. Most salons spend about 1-2 minutes per leg, but they do at least 6-7 minutes per leg (I swear, I have timed it!) They also take their time cleaning your nails and your toes, and they double check to make sure everything is clean. One thing my boyfriend appreciated was that Joanne cleaned up his feet and calluses, but did not fully get rid of his calluses that he has gotten from running. She said that she is mindful of the daily activities of her customers, and knows that active people need calluses to avoid pain! 

Near the end of our pedicure, new customers walked in for their appointments. We did not feel that our pedicures were rushed to accommodate the new customers. We felt valued and that appropriate time was taken!

It's been at least 5 years since I've eaten there so it was overdue! We were seated social distanced from other tables and the workers all had masks on. 

I got my usual hot tea, pho tai, and an order of pork eggrolls to split with my SO. The pork eggrolls were as good as I remember with their tasty dipping sauce. Then came my favorite part of eating at DP...the steaming hot bowl of pho with a full plate of add-ins. All my goodies added with a little sriracha and hoisin and I was ready to dig in. I'm a bit clumsy with chopsticks but powered through and enjoyed as much of the gigantic bowl as I could. The broth is delicious and comes with a generous amount of meat. My SO got the beef with rice but I was so focused on my pho that I didn't taste it. 

This year you do not enter the bakery to pick up your king cake, you park in a designated parking spot, text a number with what spot you're in, your order number and last name and they come and put it in your car for you. Very convenient and efficient.  This year we opted for cream cheese instead of my favorite pecan and I wasn't disappointed. In my opinion Dong Phoung has one of the best king cakes in New Orleans.

I have been going to Washington Square Pharmacy for over a year because I wanted to support a small, local pharmacy, but this is the absolute worst pharmacy I have ever interacted with. The final straw for me was my last experience during COVID when I came in to see that, of three employees that day, only one was wearing their mask: the pharmacist wasn't wearing a mask AT ALL and made no attempt to distance himself from me when he spoke, and the desk clerk's mask was worn below her nose. (They sell at least five types of masks at the same counter.) The pharmacy had somehow lost my insurance information from a previous prescription and hadn't started my prescription at all even though I called ahead, so I had to wait 15 minutes indoors with no protective glass or other measures while they got their things together. When I left, I called the desk clerk to let her know I was the person who was just there and I didn't feel safe with them not wearing their masks or wearing them improperly, to which she only said, ""Oh....okay...."" like I had said something mean to her and she was waiting for me to apologize.

They do not care about their customers at all. I ran out of refills for a prescription I need to get through the day, and they gave me no heads up or warning that I was out of refills until I tried filling it again, at which point they half-heartedly said they could maybe try my doctor and then didn't contact me again. They also didn't let me know about an emergency prescription, which I didn't even know was an option until I went to a Rite Aid and begged them for a few days of pills because I was starting to experience withdrawals, and they let me know how emergency prescriptions work and granted me three days of doses.

Their hours are also unpredictable. Sometimes they're open Sunday mornings, sometimes they're not, and there's no way to find out because their hours aren't posted anywhere outside their door. You just show up and see if they're closed.

I asked for a pricing estimate and was told they couldn't give that to me at that time, and would call me the following day with a price estimate. I found that odd, but agreed anyway. They did in fact call me the next day - so to recap, they've now successfully called me twice.

Now the real issue is that during the whole check in process, the employee DID NOT explain to me what they were charging me for and what the documents were for. They just took my ID and credit card and had me sign my name on their device. I had to ask for them to explain to me what I was signing for. Seemed like they were just rushing me out the door.

Their prices are SO REASONABLE. Most things were $1-3 cheaper than what I'm used to, so I loved that. I ordered 3 salmon avocado rolls, 1 eel avocado roll, 1 spicy salmon crunchy roll, 1 crispy CA roll, and 1 pan fried noodle beef dish. The rolls were generously PACKED with fish and avocado and wrapped with a very thin layer of rice. This shows that they aren't ripping you off. Some places try to fill you up with rice and are skimpy with the inside contents; Sushiman did not do that! The salmon was tender and fresh with great flavor and the avocado was perfectly ripe. The crispy CA roll was delicious and packed with so many different textures and flavors. I usually don't go for special rolls because they tend to be too expensive but this roll was only $5.95 (original price used to be $11.95) so I had to give it a try. My favorite part of that roll was the caviar topping. They put on a ton!! 
I do have other, less outstanding, comments to say though... the pan fried noodle beef dish tasted like it was from a cheap Chinese restaurant. Personally, I love that, but do be warned that their sushi is SIGNIFICANTLY better than the noodles. The beef was pretty tough too. But it still tasted great the next morning cold. Lastly, when I was picking up I parked in the front of the restaurant. Unfortunately, it was raining and I had to walk around to the back of the restaurant. So, just be aware that you should park in the back and not the front. Anyway, I loved this place and I cannot wait to go back again.",2021-01-03 19:04:14,348,1610,

We started with the Fried Brussels and the Albondigas, which were good.  The meatballs were especially good and probably my favorite thing - very tender and flavorful.  For the mains we had the Oaxacan Mole (duck) and Paneed Pork Chop which were good but not great.

The duck dish was 2 ways - the tamal was good but the seasoning on the breast did not seem balanced and the mole was just ok.  The pork chop portion was huge and impressive but overall, the dish was clunky and there was not enough of the side which was the tastiest part.  Also, the meat was dark gray which was off-putting.  For dessert, we had the Curry Banana Ice Cream which was good because it was different, which we appreciated.

As for the bar menu, it was underwhelming.  Looking at old menus, the offerings were more thought out and extensive, but when we went, the offerings were not varied and frankly, not good.  For example, the white wine selections were 2 bottles of the same varietal.  Huh?  Further, I'm all for offering good wine from little known wine regions in Mexico, but the wine does have to be good.  I tried 3 different wines by the glass (1 white and 2 reds) and none of them were good, so that was disappointing.

Finally, I wish there was some sort of barrier around the outdoor tables so that random passers-by cannot physically brush by your table and come that close while you're eating unmasked.  That was unnerving.  Actually, everyone brushed right by our table as we were right by the door, so not a great spot.  

Overall, for what we got / quality / experience, it was pricy and not a good value, but I would come back if I was in the area and wanted a snack.",2021-01-15 01:30:08,370,1765,

I called to make an appointment on a Sunday afternoon and got one pretty easily that same day. When I arrived I was immediately impressed with the the decor of the place. It looks like royalty! Not only was the place looking like royalty they made me feel like royalty as well.

I got a pedicure from a young man (i didn't get his name) he didn't talk much but he worked very hard on my pedicure. super detailed on the cuticles and the massage at the end was amazing as well. I opted to get the paraffin upgrade which was such a treat i'd definitely recommend everyone get this at least once every so often. A lady did my color i think she was the owner of the place. I didn't get her name either but she was super sweet and helpful. 

The same lady also did my manicure which turned out nice. she took care of my cuticles and gave me a great massage as well. not to mention the color on both my hands and my toes looks absolutely perfect!

they have wine! they didn't offer but I asked and got some with no problem. they even asked if I wanted a refill which of course i took them up on!

I called ahead and ordered my pizza to-go. The background noise was surprisingly loud when I called. I thought perhaps the restaurant was crowded, but once I got there I found that it wasn't. Granted, it was less than 30 minutes from closing time, but the restaurant was under half full and still noisy. It's one downfall of a lot of the industrial-themed eateries: unpleasantly loud dining spaces.

Luckily I wasn't dining in, so I didn't have to put up with the noise for long. I did have a 20 minute drive, so by the time I got home my pizza was cold, but that was easily fixed by popping it in the oven. 

How was it? Meh. I don't like char, and there was definitely a noticeable amount of it on the crust. The toppings were pretty good, but the bites without tzatziki - which was in blobs instead of spread around - seemed a smidge dry, especially if the bite had char. The pizza crust was cut all the way through, but oddly enough the cheese was not - perhaps it had congealed together after cooling - meaning it whenever I picked up a slice the cheese would stay behind. I don't regret spending $14 on it to try it, but I also wouldn't spend $14 on it again. I have lowbrow, hard-to-impress tastes when it comes to pizza though. Some of their other dishes would probably appeal to me more, so maybe one day when there's decent weather I'll get some to-go and go picnic in Crescent Park.

(Paladar technically has outdoor dining, but it's just a couple of small sidewalk tables. Crescent Park is just a couple of blocks away though, and has a big pavilion/covered area, so getting food to-go and picnicking in the park might be your best guarantee of shade+rain cover.)",2021-01-03 22:35:08,378,1785,

Second Sin has a lot going for it; for starters, great beer. I was immediately drawn to their Maple Boi Stout (brewed with my fav local coffee shop, Calm Waters) and their It's Cobblerin' Time- Mixed Berry Sour. To my dismay, their ABVs were 12.1% and 9.5%, respectively. ALAS! No worries. They offer the elusive 4 oz. pour! Because of the smaller portion options, I was also able to sample the Kolsch and the Gose. All four of my beers were packed with flavor. The Maple Boi was super smooth, and the Cobblerin' was deceptive in its booze content, with a super fruity palate. The only disappointment was the lack of 4 packs. Their only offerings at the time of our visit was the Kolsch. (Crowlers were an option, though!)

The other thing Second Sin has going for it is space and parking. There's indoor and outdoor options with a plethora of choices. They also had some football playing and enough room indoors to social distance. I will say, they didn't have any food, except for $5 pre-packaged popcorn. I think they have food trucks that come, but we arrived right at opening on our visit, and there wasn't one there yet. 

The staff was super quick and super friendly. I also happen to LOVE their can label designs, displayed on the side of their fridge. The beers are reasonably priced, the location is inconspicuous, and the people are good. I'm a fan.",2021-01-12 15:11:01,329,1526,

Not sure if the highlight of my stay was the termite infested room, racist employees, or gaping hole in the kitchen ceiling. Not only was my room infested with termites, but their solution was to stick my housemates and I in the tour unit where we were walked in on multiple times by employees with potential residents on tours. After ripping up the balcony attached to my room to search for termites, many men were in my room and apartment for hours each day for weeks with no warning times, just a 10 hour time frame. Doesn't feel very comfortable in a house full of young girls. The same thing happened with the workers when our ceiling started spraying like Niagara Falls above the kitchen and a hole was left in the ceiling for an entire month. The cherry on top? Employee ABBY saying the n word (both with an a and hard r in front of my black housemate) and homophobic f-slur. When my housemate brought the issue up to KENNY, he laughed and said the same disgusting words that Abby did. This was then brought up to CARLOS, who brushed it off and promoted Abby to leasing manager shortly after. They were also completely unapologetic and did nothing when we caught our neighboring unit yelling ""destroy all black people."" We also received threats written in lipstick on our front window and icon refused to check the cameras or do anything about it. Property manager Carlos has no idea how to communicate with residents or his staff. On top of everything, this place is extremely overpriced.

I finally had the opportunity to go and took it. This is one of the best museums that I have been to, hands down. I wish I could give it a few more stars, but I guess 5 will have to do. I have no idea how I was the only one there other than it being a weekday. This place should be packed.  They have a private parking lot with free parking. They validate your ticket with admission. The museum is eye catching on the outside. It is well organized, clean and very trendy on the inside. Even though the building looks huge. Exhibit space is small.  You can cover all the exhibits under 2 hours.

This place is so very interactive. My first stop was the Destination Indiana exhibit. They had a film playing that showed Indianapolis's history. Then they had some kiosks set up where you could pick what you want to learn about, including Indiana railroad, sports, special topics. 

They have revolving You Are There exhibits. During my visit there was a two on the first floor and one on the second. One the first floor there was the Madam CJ Walker, Empowering Women and Celebrate Indianapolis (1920 Centennial) exhibits.  The exhibits were awesome. They had a ton of photos, packed with information and had cool videos. That alone would have been enough, but they take it to another level. They actually have real live actors for you to interact with that take you back to that time. They are pros. They will not break character. The actor playing Madam CJ Walker was amazing.  The first floor is also home to the Cole Porter Room. It is a room designed in the likeness of New York's famed Waldorf-Astoria Hotel and a tribute to Peru, IN composer and song writer Cole Porter. This is one of the museums permanent exhibits.

They have the Gennett Studio exhibit on the second floor and some more actors for you to interact with. And like the other actors, they still in character. The second floor is also home to a library and history lab, where you learn about historical preservation.

This museum is located right off the canal and has a patio area that would be awesome to hand out on in warmer weather. You will definitely learn a lot of Indiana visiting this museum. I really loved, loved, loved this museum.  I will surely be back. I love that they have different exhibits, so it can virtually be an entirely different museum every time you visit.",2021-01-27 20:37:32,499,2431,

We usually go to the mall, but I wanted to do something special since Covid has really put a damper on our outings in 2020.  Last Thursday, New Year's Eve, I wanted to surprise her by taking her to Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Co. since neither of us have ever been to one and we both LOVE chocolate.  I looked up the hours on their website and it said they were open until 4:30.  As we were walking in the door, I noticed a sign on the door stating they close at 4 on New Year's Eve.  I had no idea what time it was so as I walked in I said to the lady behind the counter, ""I didn't realize you closed at 4 today.  It isn't 4 yet, is it?""   Her reply, in a derogatory manner, was ""Well, it's awfully close.""   So I grabbed my phone to check the time real quick and it was 3:38.  There is a limit of 5 customers in the store due to Covid. There were 3 other people in the store that were together and then my daughter and I made 5 total customers.  We looked at the chocolates for a minute and then the employee looked at one of the women and said in a very frustrated manner, ""I knew people would start coming in at the last minute.""  I was so shocked...obviously that comment was directed at me!  Knowing COVID has destroyed so many businesses, my family has made a point to shop locally and help out as much as we can.  I made a decision at that moment to leave the store...knowing my daughter would be very disappointed but unwilling to spend money where the customer is looked at as an inconvenience.  It's really a shame because the store itself is very cute.  I'm going to try the Kirkwood location in the next few weeks and will leave a review of my experience there as well.

We got the Bulgogi steak and the crispy honey chicken. We had ordered the steak before and it was fantastic. Yes it is $29 and we thought it was so worth it before. This time we ordered it and there wasn't that many potatoes as before, and the shoestring onion rings that were on top we're not there either. 

When we ordered, we were very specific and said no Green onions on the crispy chicken no sliced onions on the Bulgogi steak. We do want the shoestring onions on top. I even showed her a picture of the last time we were there. Our server brought our food out, she said oh yeah the onions don't come on top anymore we have chives which we would've asked to not be put on, and there were onions underneath. It's like our server, Gabby, didn't even listen to us. Last, the steak was a little dry as well, overcooked, more sauce, I am not sure. It looked great, just a little dry.

So glad that he's finally in a permanent location where is easier to find him and I can get my crawfish on.

To note:  crawfish is not the only thing that they serve. They have a full menu barbecue and Boudin and a whole bunch of other stuff. But for me and my house all we are concerned about is the crawfish and that's what this review will address.

This crawfish were good & to my liking... I ate every piece of it from the rooter to the tooter. I don't know what the secret sauce, I can taste a little bit a hot sauce in there but I'm not quite sure.  At any rate, it's all that and a bag of chips. 

It's still early in the season, so the crawfish are priced a little higher than I would like for them to be, but I do expect once the season is in full swing that the crawfish prices will come down. 

I'm loving that they are less than 5 miles from my house, so I can get my CRAWFISH on whenever I want. And they're open on Sundays, so hello, I can grab me some crawfish and a daiquiri and head to the lake.  See ya there.

There is alot of history and collectable decor from famous magicians. If you have ever been to the Magic Castle in Los Angeles, its kind of like this place. 

You can park at the parking structure across the street and it can be validated at the resturant. The House of Cards is located underneath the Johnny Cash museum. 

The food was delicious and amazing. We got the seared Scallops for the appetizer, the 18 oz bone in rib eye for entrées, and the limoncello cake for dessert. We also ordered an old fashion and the vodka ginger cocktail. The cocktails were on point!

The magicians that came to our table were awesome. The magic show was very entertaining.

They also have cigars for purchase that you can smoke in their patio area next to a beautiful water fountain. 

Overall, the customer service is phenomenal, the food, the show, and the atmosphere was magical! Highly recommend to celebrate a special day or to spoil yourself.",2021-01-08 03:07:00,308,1545,

EVERY SINGLE time we go to this airport, the rental car service is absolutely terrible. They never have more than 1 person working 3 different car companies, at the counter. Good luck if you arrive later than like 6 PM. It might as well be 2 AM in the morning. This last experience this month, we had a reservation for an SUV with a toddler seat. It took 30 min JUST AT THE COUNTER to have the incompetent person working the rental counter to ""find"" our car that was reserved, via a old school flip phone. We then waited 45 min outside, in the cold with my 9 month old, for them to bring the car. The entire time we waited there was not ONE single person that works for the rental car companies, outside with us. They had to pull the car from another location I guess? What the hell is the point of reservations if your damn car isn't there when you said you needed it. They have a terrible system, not enough cars, and DEFINITELY not enough staff. It is amazing that they continue to be so awful and nothing changes. We will never use anything again at Reno International, except National. At least National has 1 person for just their car rental business. Oh and National actually has staff outside, where the cars are. What a concept! Don't try to save your money using Budget, Avis, etc. The 2 hrs you waste every single rental with incompetent staff will have you paying any amount for some semblance of decent service.",2021-01-15 17:24:26,313,1483,

It was 3 rooms booked total. 2 suites and 1 king. The king bedroom lighting in the bathroom did not work so the owner just placed a lamp in the bathroom. Check out is at 10am and for late check out its an additional $20 and thats only til 1130. But I have an email that states its until 2pm max but would not be honored.  For my 3 room the owner was very rude to my brothers pregnant girlfriend with her just asking about the extra fees. Stating ""you can cancel you reservation for free and just go find another room"" 

All the rooms had outlets hanging out the walls. None of the refrigerators would get cold. I had my own pillow but the group stated the motel pillows were hard and had an odor to them. We had disinfectant spray so that helped 

I wouldn't recommend this motel at all until its brought out by a brand hotel chain or sold to a better business pioneer.

I've had plenty of delicious burgers from chains but the Habit outshines most! I probably visit at least once a month so allow me to highlight my favorite menu pieces: 

Right off the bat I can tell you my all-time favorite is the Santa Barbara Char. This masterpiece includes two hot, fresh, chargrilled beef patties with cheese and avocado on grilled sourdough. Talk about a world wonder. Whenever I think of the yummiest burgers I've had, this one lands near to top of my list. That's saying a lot considering I've eaten more burgers than you (I'm totally willing to bet on that.). 

Another item I can't leave with raving about is the new(ish, by now) Chicken Caprese on Garlic Ciabatta. This seasonal sandwich features a fat, juicy piece of chargrilled chicken breast on toasted garlic ciabatta with tomatoes and lettuce, topped with melted mozzarella cheese and basil pesto aïoli. This sandwich is a burst of flavor, a neat twist to bring a little Italian to this burger joint. If it's still offered, you best get yourself one before it's gone. 

Lastly, it would be downright disrespectful to leave out the OG. If you didn't have a Charburger at least once have you ever really been to the Habit. This signature can come with one or two juicy chargrilled patties, but I only recommend the latter if you're feeling up for a challenge or sharing the meal. I got one today and ended up having to save half it was so darn big. It will make a fantastic lunch tomorrow! 

Before I leap off my soapbox, I would like to name a few honorable mentions, all sides. French fries, onion rings, sweet potato fries and tempura green beans are all fabulous choices, can't go wrong with any of them. I mean, the salad is good too, but if you're going to get a burger for crying out loud give yourself a break just get the damn fries.

This review may be a little over the top for a chain, but it's well deserved. Hit up the Habit if you're looking for a quality burger. Just like me, you just might make a habit out of it.",2021-01-06 05:24:16,448,2121,

I started coming in November and this is the third time I went to get my eyebrows threaded by Marlene. The first two times were fine-- Marlene was made aware twice before that I had been growing my brows out for a long time and that they are getting thicker. This third time was horrible and I will likely never come back. When I came, I asked to have my eyebrows cleaned up and threaded. It seems like she was in a rush as she had another customer waiting for a wax.

Marlene over thread my eyebrows and when she was almost done, had the nerve to say that my eyebrows are really thin-- knowing that many of the stray hairs were there to continue to be grown out. When she showed me the finished product I was shocked. 3 years of eyebrow growth that I was growing out was absolutely gone. She then had the nerve to blame it on me and say that I should asked for threading only right above my eye. She threaded my eyebrows so significantly to the point that they're only lines now after 3 years of me being careful with who I go to to grow them out. Additionally, the shapes on each eyebrow now do not match at all. I'm pretty disappointed that her first reaction was to blame it on me. Now I have to wait months, maybe even a year before my next eyebrow appointment so that I can grow them out sufficiently. 

My suggestion is to go somewhere where they will recognize/listen to your attempts to grow your brows and won't remove all of the grown hairs for the sake of what they feel is the right shape.",2021-01-24 16:39:17,336,1623,

I was to have a short layover in Nashville before heading on to Pensacola. Upon our approach to Nashville a terrible storm arose and my flight was diverted to Louisville, Ky. We sat on the runway in Louisville for quite some time. When the weather cleared Southwest flew us back to Nashville. Needless to say I missed my connecting flight, and there were no other available flights out that night so I was forced to spend the night in Nashville. To their credit Southwest Airlines did hand out hotel vouchers, but after doing research I chose not to go with the hotels accepting the vouchers and chose this Marriott.

I didn't do it for snobby reasons, by this time it was 11:30 at night, and I was going to have to head back to the airport at 5:00 am, so it was a matter of convenience and safety. As a woman traveling alone I am very safety conscious, and some of the motels that accepted the voucher were ""sketchy"" and had bad reviews to say the least.

This Marriott had a shuttle which was nice, especially late at night and early in the morning to head to the airport. The gentleman who checked me in was very pleasant. I was stressed and exhausted but had a glass of wine at the restaurant bar to help me unwind.

The room was spacious, clean and updated. Loved the floors!!! I really was only there to sleep, as I was on the shuttle back to the airport at 5:00 am (ugh). This was a very nice hotel, and maybe I can come back someday and spend some time.",2021-01-17 16:20:41,320,1520,

Upon entering the restaurant it looks packed but after entering the building the atmosphere feels new and bright and has an Asian fusion vibe to it but doesn't really have the true authentic Asian feel when you normally walk into a pho restaurant. Has a very modern feel to it which I do like. The host was super nice and brought us to our table which was dirty but there were so many other open tables available. I ordered the beef pho special and it is over priced for a bowl of pho but I guess for the area it makes sense. Didn't have to wait long before our food came out. The overall quality of the food is delicious but I feel like they added a lot of MSG and sugar to the soup because I'm having to constantly drink a lot of water. The portions of the meal was below average because a small bowl usually doesn't cost $13.99 for a pho special. I've eaten pho from many different places and the normal price range for that is between $8-$10.99 and it's usually the normal sized bowl.

""Easiest Truck (or car) buying experience EVER (except the 2 days of driving). I save thousands off MSRP!!""

Mike Matthews - low key & helpful sales guy!!!


WOW, sorry, but i had a great experience on the sales side. I purchased a brand spanking new Red Tacoma 4x4 Access Cab in the Off-Road trim. You can go to any online automotive reviews to see how cool the truck is (check out the video of the ""crawl"" function.)

This review is for the buying experience. I was checking price & availability in 5 states (Tacoma's can be hard to come buy). I actually had an ""in"" with a dealer in another state to get the ""friends and family"" discount. All i had to do was find a truck the could swap.

So, in my search, Peterson had exactly what i wanted. I liked that they post the price, including their discounts on the website - none of the give us your contact information and we will whisper in your ear the price. The price, by the way was lower that the employee pricing i was going to get someplace else (after swapping).

i used the peterson contact form, Yessie (internet sales) hooked me up with Mike Matthews (sales guy). We spoke several times over the phone (i live a days drive from Boise). The truck was due to arrive in 3 to 4 weeks. They wanted a ""non returnable"" buy ""transferable"" deposit to hold the truck for me. That sent of alarm bells - ding ding ding - but Mike talked me through it. i'm like, i want the truck, so if you can't guarantee me the truck, then blah blah blah.

So, mike peels me off the ceiling, and i take some time to think about. i call him back, Mike want the truck. Give him my credit card - my name goes on the truck. I have done conversations with finance, i'm good. Then a couple of days later they call to make sure it's ok if they charge the card, what??! you didn't do that 16 seconds after i gave it to you??? i start feeling prettying good.

in the conversations, i told Mike ""i don't like surprises"", so mike walked me through on what to expect, what could be a ""surprise"" etc - Great experience.

The car arrives 5 days early, i get the truck a week early.

The price was exactly as expected (except a $14 DMV type fee), in finance. These guys found me every type of discount they could !!

This new spot opened a week ago and has been non-stop busy since. It's a very small shop with two walk up touch screen ordering systems. The menu changes weekly so there is a digital menu where you can pick your cookie of choice. Since this was my first time visiting, I had to try more than one. Unfortunately, you can't just order the number you want; you can order one cookie or the next smallest option is four. I was disappointed that the Milk Chocolate Chip was sold out but I had plenty of other options to pick from and chose: Snickerdoodle Cupcake, Biscoff Lava, Frozen Hot Chocolate, and Chilled Sugar. Ugh, it hurts my wallet to say this but, I spent $12 on four cookies... each cookie averages about $4 a piece. They are large/heavy cookies but wow that's pricey for a cookie. Once your order is placed, you get your cookies quick! Since the cookies are so large and most of them have cream on top, they can't stack them so they do come in large boxes. *Plan to go somewhere else to try your cookie or eat your cookie in the car like I did, there's no seating available. 

Now here is where my ultimate disappointment is... none of the cookies blew me away. Did they taste ""bad""? No, but they weren't worth. The Snickerdoodle Cupcake cookie (served hot) tasted good but the frosting on top was just too much for me. The Frozen Hot Chocolate Cookie (served cold) was more like a brownie, a good brownie though! The frosting on the top did taste exactly like hot chocolate and I think I would have liked it more had the cookie not had anything on top of it, it was a lot of sweet chocolate. The Chilled Sugar (served cold) was, by far, my least favorite... I had a small bite and threw the rest away. The frosting was overwhelmingly almond flavored and the cookie all together was far too sweet to enjoy. The Biscoff Lava was my favorite of the four flavors but I could only eat a third of it before it became too sweet like the cookies.

I explained how critical it was that the bag's zipper worked as I was leaving on a medical assignment and the bag would be holding life saving products. Not only that but the bag would be zipped and unzipped several times by airport TSA security as they checked the product inside because it cannot be x-rayed. I was assured that all would be well & 10 minutes later, my bag was ""fixed"". Two days later I went through security where my bag was opened, as expected, & the zipper broke immediately.

It is open from 11 AM till 10 PM Monday thru Saturday & until 9:30 PM on Sundays. 

A small restaurant, there are approximately 8 booths that each seat four patrons, as well as three larger tables that each seat eight. There's also a small front open air patio. I suggest online reservations if you want to be assured a table. 

There are no paper menus available; the menu is large, hardcover, & its pages are laminated. Takeout is an option, as well as delivery.  

There are 10 available appetizers. Our Crab Rangoon @ $6.95 was made w/ cream cheese & a ""hint of curry."" However, the inside cheese pulled like mozzarella, so I'm unsure what else these wantons contained. I found it to be average in texture & flavor; however, my date liked it more. The Jasmine's Sampler for two @ $13.95 looked interesting; it contains two crab rangoon, two eggrolls, two chicken gyoza, two fried shrimp, & two fried wanton. Maybe next time:-)

Five Soups are offered, 3 salads, 4 Yum dishes (including squid), 14 Jasmine Specials (all served w/ steamed white rice-- & no substitutions), 8 Entrees (all served w/ steamed white rice-- no substitutions), 4 Curry Dishes, 4 Fried Rice (including Pineapple Fried Rice), 5 types of Noodles (not served w/ rice), & miscellaneous desserts. Wines are also available for purchase-- see pic. If it's Domestic Beer or Imported Beer you desire, both are available. 

There is a Specials Board inside near the entrance-- see pic. Today it contained 11 offerings that ranged in price from $14.95 to $23.95. There was also a Specials page within the large menu; it offered 9 Thai dishes & 2 Thai appetizers-- see pic. 

We shared Shrimp Pad Thai; it was very good. We also split Panang Curry w/ Beef (w/ white rice). It was very good as well-- loaded w/ vegetables & it had a mild coconut flavor. Patrons will be asked to specify their preferred spice level; we requested mild to medium; the chef prepared both dishes beautifully. Our two entrees w/ one appetizer came to $39.99 before tip-- seemed average in price for Thai food. 

I won't hesitate to return if hungry & in the area. However, I reside in another county & closer to my favorite Thai restaurant-- Little Ninja Thai Cafe of Zephyrhills.  

Our service was very good. Unfortunately,  no name tags were worn, no server name appeared on our bill, & when we did try to learn of our excellent server's name, we couldn't seem to get her attention or the owner's-- the only other staffer on the floor.

You can tell that is not a category they lack in :)* Once the spray started Anthony was meticulous, and very aesthetic in his spray. He sprays to create natural shadows were the body contours. They spray was flawless. (And I know it's just the bronzer the first 8 hours but still, it looked great). After the spray he offered the disposable robe and anything else I needed. I did not feel rushed, pressured or uncomfortable in any way. The next morning I woke up and took a shower to see what the end result would be. *another side note, I had a photoshoot this particular morning so I was very worried about my hands and feet being blotchy*.

We were a group of 9 people, when we arrived they checked our temperature, gave us hand sanitizer and asked us to check in ourselves in the computes they have where you give your general information and sign the waiver.

Now, about the mission all I can say is that almost everything inside the room had a purpose, that you have to read and look for clues or things that you think are movable.

However if you or your group are not finding a way out of clues there's a screen where your guide will provide some information since she has a camera and a microphone inside so aside from you having fun they do have fun as well while watching you struggle haha.

The few days he was there, it was pure misery. The staff are not culturally sensitive or empathetic at all to him nor to other patients in the unit. Here are some key reasons why everyone need to STAY AWAY from Belmont:

- He experienced prejudice and racism from the other patients in the unit. And he felt neglected when he did not feel supported by the staff, thus he DID NOT feel safe at all. Naturally, he wanted to leave AMA afterwards. He called his mother in fear that he would get physically assaulted/jumped by other patients.
- There was no source of water other than from staff themselves. So he was thirsty all the time. Whenever he asked for water, the staff would comment amongst themselves ""why does he ask for water all the time?""
- He felt that his problems (why he was admitted in the first place) was minimized by the staff (nurse, social worker, techs). The only person he felt listened to him sincerely and genuinely was the psychiatrist.
- He overheard the Social Worker Antoinette question his side of the story about an incident. He overheard her saying ""why would he lie about getting racist remarks?""
- Staff was not empathetic nor compassionate to him or any other patients.
- Staff spoke foul language amongst themselves, which is very unprofessional 

Importantly, the staff at Belmont lacked cultural sensitivity, diversity or inclusion, and was not a treatment facility at all, but a jail. My family member already had issues with bullying in the past, so him staying at Belmont actually WORSENED his mental health condition.

As a nurse myself, I am simply applaud by his experiences.

I called Albert about the alternator and he told me to take it to Pep Boys.  There is no Pep Boys here that handles parts.  I told him this and he said he would send me a check for the part. I'm still waiting on the check. My regular mechanic was doing a routine check and found the turbine blades were breaking apart. This mechanic is someone that I have trusted for 10 years so called Jasper concerning the warranty. Basically, without even requesting for the turbocharger to be sent to them for future investigation, is blaming the damage on everything except the turbo. I dont drive this vehicle much so there is less than 500 miles on this ""new"" faulty turbocharger.
He might be a great mechanic for gasoline engines but from my perspective, have this being the only vehicle that I have taken to him, I'm not so sure.
All that I know is that  I paid nearly $2000 for a repair that didn't even last 500 miles for a replacement of an alternator and a turbocharger. that was a year ago.",2021-01-20 15:35:22,331,1601,

Later on, I told my girlfriend about it and we were both hooked instantly.  The food was always good, and the service was top notch.  We even dined at the same table at most of the visits.  Even when we moved to Virginia in 2011, we would always stop by and order our favorite meals during the Christmas holidays.  But thanks to the COVID pandemic, we had no choice but to order takeout to remain safe at her mom's house. 

We called our order in and picked it up about 30 minutes later.  The front desk was covered with plexiglass and the hostess was wearing a face mask while handling over our orders.  Safety precautions taken.  For my order, it was a baked salmon roll which was salmon wrapped around snow crab filling and baked, an order of fried fish cakes w/wasabi sauce for dipping (which we both shared) and noodle salad (girlfriend had noodle salad and fried oyster roll).  A nice meal for lunch.  The only slight negative I have is the noodle salad was a bit dry.  Probably because they didn't want it to be completely soaked in the dressing, but it tasted the same as always.  And one thing I did like is when our rolls came in the takeout boxes, the staff did the right thing by having the sweet drizzle in a container which you could sprinkle yourself, along with the soy sauce if you wanted to dip as well.  This was only my 2nd time eating the baked salmon rolls, but it was very good.  And the fried fish cakes tasted the same just like every visit.

Overall, a pleasure to stop by here as always.  Times are very tough, but I know they can persevere through this.  Till next time!",2021-01-03 20:40:22,363,1754,

It's just a weird thing about me that I hate calling restaurants! Well today I had to go and pickup my winning lottery ticket (soon I'll be a billionaire!) and decided what the heck--I'll call an order in.  I called and they answered quickly and politely, placing me on hold briefly while I could overhear them helping another customer. They said the food would be ready in about 40-45 minutes. I arrived about an hour later to pick it up, as my lucky stop took a little longer than anticipated, and my order was not yet ready. I'm pretty easy going so I had a seat and waited. I could hear people who were dining-in discussing how tasty the food was; one table even telling their waitress that they will most definitely be returning. The food took about 10 minutes or so. Once I arrived home, I had intended on taking a beautiful picture for all my Yelp friends but hunger got the best of me and I couldn't wait, I'm sorry! We ordered quite a few things to try since we have never been here before... Vegetable Samosas, Paneer Pakoras, Chicken Tikka Masala, and breads (Naan, Garlic Naan, and Onion Kulcha) and we would do it all again! The Vegetable Samosas may just be the best I've ever had! However, I had to get used to the Chicken Tikka Masala as it was a little different than I've ever had--but I ended up really enjoying it! The Paneer Pakoras were very tasty as well! And the bread--well, you can't go wrong there! Our only ""complaint"" is that things seemed a bit salty. But that won't stop us from returning!

 We visited on a week day, in the afternoon, after a doctor's appointment, and in the sweltering heat their AC felt quite nice. There was one plastic chair at the front, along with old free Chinese newspapers and info, plus dusty religious CDs in Vietnamese, but my senior relative was grateful to sit in it. 

 In the era of Covid-19: the Vietnamese restaurant was sadly closed, and the sour-faced woman playing with her phone did not feel like an invitation to ask about To-Go foods. We would love a BBQ duck one day.

In fact, sadly, this was my biggest problem with Lee Lee's Market...a lack of friendliness to the point of unprofessionalism. I look forward to an opportunity to change that opinion in the future. I will try again because there is a lack of these type of markets and I did find unique products there (though not as many from the countries that I expected).

 At least one older male employee *was* welcoming, and we really appreciated that, but my disabled (physically) relative and myself got a decent amount of judgemental looks -- regardless if we smiled back. We were watched as we used the dingy, stuffy bathroom. Watched as we examined products as if we would shoplift. 

At one point I asked an employee in the meat/butcher area, ""What time does the store close?""

 First he feigned not understanding, then claimed not to know...in their own store...and didn't bother to ask anyone else either.

Come on! 
We just felt mocked and unwelcome.
Still, we were polite.

   In the end we spent over $200, much on all new products we'd never tried before from all over the world! The East Indian, Eastern European, Greek, and Middle Eastern products were great! I struggled to find basic Vietnamese rice noodles, but FINALLY got them in the ""ramen"" section. 

 However, I did have to pack the majority of my items myself, after hours being on my feet (that store is a work out!! ) and again there was no conversation despite several attempts -- at least there was a smile or two. 

 Some items were very reasonable in price, others -- particularly Japanese  -- were inflated. And there wasn't much variety in that cuisine either (but you can find the basics, though I didn't see bags of short-grain rice). Now. Although I am a long-time lover of Asian markets, companies like #Amazon and #eBay have changed the face of groceries and products -- we can get A LOT online now, no need to suffer sour attitudes.

 Produce: it was bad that day; lots was wilted. Too bad bc I love so many Asain veggies. Glad to see things like Mountain Potato and Burdock though. But! My gai lan was perfect and a real treat when we got home. We bought a giant avacado; it didn't ripen well, but I still ate it like a cooked vegetable. Was thrilled to find quail eggs!

 Footnote: A+ people watching! Lots of variety, beautiful clothes from different cultures. I look forward to having the time and energy to explore the African food! Also, the alcohol and housewares.",2021-01-19 13:50:56,661,3164,

No apology and marched herself to the back bar.  I requested where to sit seeing as she was trying to place us with a small child in the middle of all the full tables.  Good note - great drink specials.  I'm glad I asked - the waitress didn't offer or mention any specials.  My friend arrived and our drinks. I ordered my sons food and they brought his burger sliders out burnt and without cheese and without his drink.  I figured maybe just coming later. Never did, j had to ask them for it and watched my waitress pass a handful of times and clear a table but still hadn't brought my toddlers juice, poor thing kept asking for it .   I asked her about the cheese and all I got was a sorry.  My 3!63-4 old has a tiny 1/3 cup of fruit and apple juice because the rest of his food wasn't edible sadly.

This restaurant is new, so I anticipate they'll make some adjustments over time to get their stars up. I would return. 

To start, we ordered the shishito peppers, which are standard fare at any modern Asian restaurant, but the seasonings used at Red Bloom made something standard stand out. I would order this again. 

Next up: the pork belly bao buns. Definitely do yourself a favor and order these! The umami factor is not missed with this adventure of an appetizer. One in our party actually ordered them as her main.

For our entrees, we ordered two types of ramen, the pork belly and spicy miso. My ramen was not nearly as hot as it should have been, and the ramen noodles had been cooked too long. With ramen, you always serve the noodles al dente and allow the guest to determine the texture they want their noodles to be by serving it in the scalding hot liquid that the noodles sit and continue to cook in. Instead, that decision was made for me. Haru on Longley gets this concept right consistently, and having lived in Japan for two years, I appreciate their attention to authenticity.

The texture of all the ingredients in the bowl were also too similar, so this was an overall huge miss for me. The presentation was lazy for a dish you can enjoy for less at Haru. Take a look at my ramen from there and ask yourself which one is worth $18.

The spicy miso, which comes with a warning of two chiles on the menu, is not spicy -- not even a little bit.

The friendliness and warmth of our server, Angelo, was very inviting.

Although nobody in our party was Asian, I do have to make mention of the fact that this restaurant was designed and decorated using quite a lot of white. White is a color associated with purity, but it's also a color associated with death and mourning and is reminiscent of funerals. I don't know why Americans insist on upscale Asian concepts being so white.

No superstitious Hong Kong high roller is going to want to start their gambling evening with a meal in a restaurant with so much white; it's considered very unlucky.",2021-01-11 00:14:24,454,2212,

Cookies and biscuits included. Added cornbread and the banana pudding to try and an extra 1/2 pint of Mac and cheese because weren't sure how hungry the kiddo was, but the original deal was plenty. We had leftovers of everything 2.5 of us). 

I'll preface by saying we will definitely be ordering again. 

Pick up was quick. Ready within 10 mins on a Friday at 5 pm. Food was warm when we got home. 

Brisket. So so good. The fatty part just melts in your mouth. I don't know how much to say it but the brisket was just so good. 

Sauce. We did classic and the sugar free. Honestly, we didn't like either, the sugar free was like tomato paste? I don't know, but not a fan.  The classic was fairly vinegar-y and my husband want a fan. I'm not even mad about it. Know why?  That brisket was so good I wouldn't advise putting any sauce on it anyway. Even if the sauce was good I think we would skip it. Like why is sauce even offered for this, it's offensive to the meat. So much flavor and melts in your mouth. There was an option for no sauce and when ordering I thought ""who would order no sauce?"". Next time, we will that's who!  For real. Just get the brisket, skip the sauce, and watch your life change before you. 

Sides. Green beans were great. Everyone loved them. Mac and cheese was great. Nice and creamy, I do like when you get that cheesey crust on top, ours didn't have it but didn't notice much till after because it was really good. The coleslaw was OK. I like mine a tad sweeter, so added a pinch of truvia on the leftovers and it was perfect for me the next day. Horseradish was enough to taste but not enough to make you cry. Would order all these again or maybe try something new. Or stick with it. Who knows. 

Biscuits. My husband hates biscuits. Didnt think that was possible like who hates biscuits? Not this southern gal. But man, did he finish every last bite. So fluffy and big. Great flavor. I don't even know what was on top of it, butter? Honey? Both? Don't know, don't care. Delicious. Get them. 

Cornbread. It was cornbread. Nothing special. I'd get the biscuits over the cornbread. Whatever the spread they added, my kid ate up all the way. Not sure what it was, but it was good. But those biscuits were on point. I'd pass the cornbread for the biscuits for sure. 

Desserts. The cookies were super gooey in the middle nice little crunch on the outside. Pretty perfect. The banana pudding my husband loved and he's pretty picky with banana pudding.

Overall. Loved it. Great portion. Great deal. 2.5 of us and it was definitely enough for 2 meals with a little extra which I love as well. Nice to have a bbq nearby!

Since moving to Soulard, I have seen Gus' Pretzels everytime I go to take I-55 as it's right off the exit on Arsenal. Talk a bout prime real estate! This location is so easy to get to even if you don't live in the neighborhood. They have two parking lots that offer ample space when you stop by to grab some warm pretzels. They have a really smart setup during the pandemic to help keep customers safe and socially distanced. The doors on Arsenal are only used to enter the building and the doors in the rear near the parking lot are used as the main exit. It's smart! No one passes you as you enter and leave.

I will admit. I have had Gus' Pretzels in the past and never really cared for them. They were always really hard. But I'm so glad I impulsively stopped by to finally try these pretzels fresh! I was very impressed upon entering to see that they offered so much more than just plain pretzels. They had many sandwiches, all of which sounded very tempting, including one with andouille sausage to celebrate the Mardi Gras season. 

I purchased three pretzel sticks and the total was just over $2. What a deal! When I got my iconic Gus' brown bag, the contents were very hot to the touch. I was very surprised! I Could barely make it out the door to rip my mask off and demolish the first of three sticks. While the pretzels are warm they are pillowy soft. The flavor was incredible! I finished the rest of the pretzels before I parked only about 5 blocks away. That's a true testament to how good they were!

It's a typical chain restaurant with a less than personal feel. While I will say that I was pleased at the variety and vegan options on the menu (though I was a little skeptical at first, as I always am at chains because they generally hire staff that is not knowledgeable about what it means to be plant based). I made sure to do some research and confirm with our waiter who went to the back to read their manuals. When we walked in, it was a packed house and were told it would be a 30 min wait so we went to sit by the bar. The bartender didn't acknowledge us until I got a text saying our table was ready so she said to just order at the table though we were prepared to eat at the bar because we were hungry. When we sat down, our waiter was super friendly. He was patient with my questions and accommodating with my requests. Our food was brought out by a food runner not too long after we ordered but it came without the hot sauce I asked for. I ordered the The Low Carb Uretor Burger with an Impossible Patty and confirmed that the mushrooms & onions that came on the burger were vegan; aka, grilled in oil instead of butter. I also ordered the Sweet Potato Tots instead of the Wedge Fries since my husband was getting those with his burger. I was less than pleased when my burger came out with 2 leaves of completely wilted (or rotten) lettuce and a less than half full basket of Sweet Potato Tots for an upcharge of $1.99. There's also an upcharge for the Impossible Patty, obviously. Bringing the Burger itself to $14.49 (with no bun). I half contemplated ordering a 'Veggie Assembly' because the waiter let us know that the Pretzel Buns were vegan when he went to kitchen to look at the ingredients. I'm glad I didn't do that though because had I ordered what I wanted, it would have been a $17.50 burger (alone) like my husband's niece ordered at the table. That price was for the Impossible Patty on a Gluten Free Bun, Avocado, Caramelized Onions & Sauteed Mushrooms; not including the $2.99 for the Wedge Fries on the side. I find that absolutely ridiculous. Anyways, back to my issues with lettuce & tot situation; our waiter happily had the kitchen bring some fresh lettuce, the Cholula hot sauce I asked for and he put in another order of Sweet Potato Tots free of charge because he said those are supposed to be weighed out (duh because chain restaurants have rules lol). The second order of Sweet Potato Tots came out a few mins later and were actually better than the first because they were more well done and not so raw.

High Level: new management here.. good experience and pricing.. give them a chance. 

Wife's car had gotten up there in miles and may have been turning a corner from a 'tool', to a 'tool' that was going to start costing us money. So she started looking for a new one. 
We looked and test drove some cars at other dealerships.. but when she decided on a new car, it became purely about getting a good deal and feeling comfortable about who we were dealing with. Wife fell in love with the Hyundai Palisade Calligraphy edition.. so shopping we went!

Chatted with 3 dealerships and got initial pricing from each of them. Got an 'out the door price' from one but didn't feel like we were getting a good deal. 
The next morning I pinged Indy Hyundai online and got an immediate response from Angie, chatted with her on the phone for a bit to explain what we were looking to do.  45 minutes later, wife and I finished lunch and headed to Indy Hyundai in hopes of putting together a deal.  Angie had told me that she was on the leadership team and would be roping in one of her sales guys/mangers, Kohlin. 

We ended up taking a look at a couple Calligraphy editions in different colors, then narrowed it down to 2 that had the options that best fit our lifestyle.  From there it was off the races... how much could we get for our trade? How much can we get the car for? 
Overall, we got slightly more for our trade then another dealership had offered.. and we got the calligraphy for a reasonable price.  We were looking at the bottom line ""out the door price"", encompassing all taxes, fees, out trade in, etc.  
Our out the door price ended up being a few grand less than the bottom line/best price we'd gotten from another local Hyundai dealership.  We left with a beautiful new car and content on the deal we got. 
Thank you Angie, Kohlin and the other folks we dealt with 

Additional details... in the few hours we spent there looking and wrapping things up we came to learn: 

Dealership under new management as of recent (couple months maybe?)
Only 1 or 2 people from the old regime are still there, so don't let an old review or experience keep you from giving them a chance
The dealership interior is a bit drab... it's slated for a much needed renovation/facelift in the coming months
Car buying doesn't have to be a pain.. we had a good time
Financing was easy.. and cash is cheap right now, so we financed the whole thing.  Will pay it off when we want to.

Jon Hughes Realty One Group Eminence, ""independent Realtor"" in Reno, Nevada was one of several real estate agents we contacted.

We did our due diligence and Jon Hughes Realty One Group Eminence, ""independent Realtor"" failed to adequately respond.

FIRST, this ""independent Realtor"" doesn't have a Veterans Discount to buyers and sellers of real estate. A publicly disclosed daily Veteran Discount provides resource to ensure Veterans (rare 7% of the population) opportunity to participate in American Dream their sacrifices have made possible.

SECOND, this ""independent Realtor"" spent a lot of time telling us about his ""Knowledge, Speed, Convenience, Professionalism! Security, Honesty, Dedication!"" and ""Straight talk, no catch. True choice to do it how you want"",  yet 

a) he never provided us with three references, 

b) he never provided us with a copy of his required State of Nevada business license (severe fine and a NRS 598 Deceptive Trade Practice if he doesn't have), 

c) he never provided us with his required county business license, (a NRS 598 Deceptive Trade Practice if he doesn't have), 

d) he never provided us with his required county fictitious firm name filed certificate (a crime per NRS 602.090  and a NRS 598 Deceptive Trade Practice if he doesn't have),

e) he never provided us his required city business license(s) (a crime and a NRS 598 Deceptive Trade Practice if he doesn't have), 

f) he never provided us with a copy of his personal or vehicle liability insurance in the event someone was injured while he was driving a buyer or showing a house, 

g) he never provided us a copy of his agreement with his real estate broker in the event someone was injured while he was driving a buyer or showing a house, 

h) he never provided us with a copy of his required State of Nevada real estate license, (a NRS 598 Deceptive Trade Practice if he doesn't have), and 

i) he immediately emailed us MLS-bot listings that bragged, ""new hot water heater"", ""new roof"", new addition"", ""new furnace"", ""new a/c"", ""new hot tub"", ""new electrical"", ""new plumbing"", yet there is no record of these improvement boasts having the required city or county permit(s) which is a clear safety, health and habitability issue to any buyer.  (All permits are a matter of public record and easily looked up.)

We noticed that there is some outdoor seating for warmer weather, but inside, there really aren't dining tables, just benches.  Over in the bar area which is 21+ only, there seemed to be a few small tables, but during Covid, everyone is expected to grab and go.

They do have menus at the counter to look at and the staff were really courteous and helpful.  To the right of the order counter is a small display of the days sweets.  We were focused on lunch, so I got a Chicken Salad Sandwich and my wife ordered a breakfast sandwich with egg&sausage.

 I upgraded my sandwich to be served on a really tasty croissant.  The chicken salad was a little dry when served on the croissant.  Not sure if it was a bit overcooked or just needed a little more mayo/salad dressing to make it more appealing.  It's a fine line because if it gets too moist, the croissant would lose it's crispy flakiness, so have an idea if you are going to eat it right away or leave it in a to go box for a ride home to eat.  The flavor was good, just need to solve the moisture problem.

My wife liked the flavor of the breakfast sandwich with cheddar and sausage.  She thought the egg was overcooked, but otherwise the rest was fine.
 
One thing I really appreciated was that my order of a house coffee (served straight) was hot, but not scalding.  I could drink it promptly after ordering it.  My pet peeve is coffee served too hot.  This had good flavor and helped with the flakiness of my sandwich.  They also serve alcohol but I didn't explore those options during my morning visit.  This place just opened in Oct 2020 (I believe that was when) and they are hopeful  that the warmer weather will continue to allow them to fine tune their dining experience.

The place was clean and because of the carry out service, there was no issue with social distancing.

We called this bar and grill at 11:07 pm and asked what time they close, the bartender said midnight, to which I responded, oh great we're on our way, thank you, and hung up. We then walked in less than 10 minutes later where we were greeted by a very frantic gentleman who said ""we're only serving drinks"" it was after 11 so I didn't even think food would be being served, we were more so there for the ""bar setting"". Anyhow, we said ok, and found a table in the back and sat down, there was 4 of us... The frantic gentleman approached us minutes later and said ""I was mistaken, my manager just told me we're done serving for the night"" mind you, this was well before 11:30 pm and we had JUST called... Also, there were people everywhere, none of whom were wearing masks, all four in my party were, and there was even a private party in the back room, with someone pouring champagne into champagne flutes.... So I explained the frantic sir that we had just called and the lady on the phone said they were open until midnight, he kind of brushed me off and said, ""well my manager said we're done serving"" ... While my party and I sat there for a couple minutes deciding what to do, we watched frantic sir bring out TWO orders of drinks ... We were obviously irritated, so we picked up our crap to leave and while we are walking passed the bar on the way out, the bartenders were serving people drinks at the bar.... What gives? We literally just wanted somewhere to have maybe 2 beverages, count down to midnight, kiss each other and leave....we ended up at the casino, where we won a shit ton of money and had a GREAT time... But little frantic dude, manager who wouldn't serve my party, and the bartender who told me you were open until midnight... Maybe you guys should communicate more with each other on your plans for your establishment on new years Eve, or any big events where you will have a LARGE amount of people in your bar.",2021-01-02 03:31:28,438,2040,
FW7nL_692v4sDXvqTakZvw,FtxkeuJy2t99qrFsKrzHtA,j_6LvHUJlu-wI5bJUDgMtA,5,0,0,1,"ADDED: (I read some other reviews after I wrote mine and I wanted to add that every staff member was wearing a mask while I was inside the place was impeccably clean they had hand sanitizer available I saw no flies and my food was not cold but just right when I got it! And as you'll see if you keep reading my review I'm in the restaurant industry I've had food poisoning three times and I would not eat here if I thought it was a danger to anyone) 

I want to preface this by full disclosure that I am in the restaurant industry and  also serve as a food and beverage consultant :-)

I had heard about this place from a friend and wanted to check it out on my last night in town. I checked the Yelp page and found out they closed at 10 PM and headed over around 845. Parking lot was empty but the open sign was on when I pulled up about 8:55 PM and saw four workers inside cleaning. When I walked in I was greeted by a friendly cashier! 

Sometimes when I walk into an empty restaurant towards the end of the night I see the staff give each other side looks kind of exchanging glances like why is this person making us work when we're almost closed but I got none of that here! In fact the staff was talking to each other and seemed very happy to all be working together. 

I ordered my food and as I was paying the girl asked me my name and jokingly I said you should just put my name down as solo because I'm the only one here. 

She said oh that's because we close in five minutes :-) she didn't say at me and she said it with a smile kind of trying to explain why there was no other customers. I felt terrible because obviously if someone in the business I would never walk in five minutes before a restaurant closed and expect to order food. I apologized profusely to her and explained that the yelp site said that they closed at 10 and she said they had adjusted hours because of Covid. I again explained I am so sorry it's OK you guys don't have to make my food. But another staff member chimed in at that time and said no problem! 

I have to say to whoever manages this restaurant I was so very impressed that these young people working here we're not upset at all by the fact that some dude walked in five minutes before closing and then of course when I looked over what they were doing they were cleaning and everything had already been cleaned and they had to make my food even though they were almost ready to go. I did give them a decent tip !

I also sat in the parking lot eating my food while I watch them working inside and I will say that they worked fast efficiently and they all looked very happy to be working here!  As an industry professional that is either good management good ownership or both :-) I don't know if they will see this review but to the crew that was working Monday, January 18 thank you for being so kind to me and for doing such a great job especially the girl at the cash register! 

Now onto the food I had fried chicken tacos and the ground beef taco and both were excellent I will definitely be back for more tacos and because of the stellar service I received thank you tin roof tacos!",2021-01-19 05:33:23,651,3136,

Having seen the 2 previous reviews, I was concerned about a less than perfect dining experience, but the staff and cooks at Nevada Steak leaned in and gave us a memorable 2021 experience.

Located in the Tamarack Junction Casino, we took advantage of the location and gambled a bit before our early dining experience.  To sweeten the experience, the slots were paying out in the afternoon, so our dinner was on TJC dime, so starting the NY out with diamonds on the souls of our shoes.  ;-)

I really liked Nevada Steak's house spinach salad with candied walnuts, cranberries, red onions, spinach and a vinaigrette on the side.  The bread is a sourdough, most yummy.

I ordered the lobster and shrimp linguini with large amounts of lobster and shrimp.  My son had the surf and turf with rice pilaf, and the lobster (6 oz filet and lobster tail)  was huge.  My other son had chicken parmesan and dad had the medallions of filet beef with shrimp scampi.

The staff were very courteous and friendly.  Service was A+.  Not too busy at 4:30 PM when the restaurant opens but they were pretty busy when we left.

I did like the ambience of the old steakhouse at the Tamarack, but I realized that because of the pandemic, it may have forced businesses to design eating establishments and casino layouts differently.  It looks like Tamarack may have wanted to add more casino floor to spread the machines out more and that affected eating establishments to where they are spread out and combined for a more flexible dining experience.  It looks like Sullys and Nevada Steak merge and are separated by a chain like curtai",2021-01-02 02:19:34,333,1698,

The place is cute and clean with great chandeliers that mimic ice. Just wish the customer service was up to par. Now, I don't like to base my review on 1 bad egg, but it sure does make a lasting first impression. 
The girl behind the counter Friday night was on her phone and had a scowl on her face (and this is while she was wearing a mask, can you imagine how deep her expression had to be to catch this?) I initially asked about the popsicles that are prominently displayed upon walking in- I asked if any of them were dairy-free. She responded with, ""I don't know, they don't tell us.""

Interesting. I proceeded to the shaved iced concoctions. I knew the taro one had dairy but I brought my little Lactaid pill with me and bit the bullet. Again, the presentation is beautiful, and I guess this is where the girl excels as a worker. But the customer service between her and those I encountered at Kelp, the sushi joint next door, was just night and day. 

Little did I know, Kelp, the sushi joint next door is owned by the same owners. I initially came here for a small dinner followed by dessert while eating indoors.

I asked the girl what the Wi-Fi info was. Again, she looked annoyed, and said there is no Wi-Fi. I proceeded to show her the 2 networks associated with Nice. She said, ""I don't know, they don't tell us."" I said, hm, just like you don't know if the products you sell have dairy in them?

She left the store. I figured she was having a bad day. However, not 1 but 2 girls came from Kelp and told me the Wi-Fi info for Kelp. I thanked all the girls and am proceeding to eat my monster Sexy Geisha roll that was kindly recommended by the young gentleman at Kelp while typing this up! 

Please business owners and managers: Understand that the pandemic has us all hiding indoors, the least you can provide is common courtesy when a customer decides to spend their money and time enjoying your product at your establishment.",2021-01-30 02:05:59,433,2017,

I reviewed the menu online and called for them them to explain some of the items in it. I was having trouble understanding the lady over the phone, so I decided to drive over to try to see if we can speak about it in person. I find the lunch menu to be very confusing since you seem to get the same amount of food for $11.95 as you do for the $9.95 two roll option yet you get more choice on the two roll option which includes the same types of rolls to pick from as in the $11.95 option (or so I think...). They both come with a soup. I asked the host to please explain to me what the differences were on the menu items that she kept on going around my question and telling me one was a roll and one was sushi. She could have shown me the difference between what she meant by roll and sushi. Instead she kept on giving me the same answer, which was not clear at all and mid conversation, the sushi chef told her something in, I assume Japanese, and as she went over and started picking up after some tables and left me standing there without any service. It was very rude and demeaning. My question could have been in easily resolved within a minute and I even pulled out my phone to see if I could communicate with her via Google translate or pull up photos of sushi to see if I could understand what she meant. For some reason, she thought I was arguing about the price, when  if anything I just wanted to know the difference between the options since the less expensive one seemed like a much better deal and that confused me. I'm trying to help small local businesses out during this pandemic and their behavior was the worst I've ever had in a restaurant. Worst of all I had to go back to work with an empty stomach.

I had confirmed for 6-8 weeks, 5-7 times with this office my appointment and how it was going to work. It was an annual exam and I changed insurance so the annual is preventive and with a $0 cost. During this time I checked with my new insurance twice and they confirmed they do not care when my last annual was and they will cover my annual exam. I had clarified this with the office during the numerous calls I had with them. I go in, they have a manager and she claims she has been there for 7 years and she did not allow me to be seen without paying $150 to them. She let me sit for 30 minutes and made me complete numerous papers and wanted to charge me at the end or would not let me be seen. This office is a waste of time and they better give me every single record so I can take to my next gyn. They wasted months of my times and numerous calls and have untrained managers and have attitudes on the phone and when you see them. I cannot describe their attitude. We pay them and they give us attitudes. THEY WANT TO CHARGE YOU FOR WHAT THEY WILL GET FROM THE INSURANCE BUT THEY DO NOT GIVE YOU CREDITS WHEN THE INSURANCE PAYS THEM. This happened to me for years until I found out at work that there should not have been copays. They do not care but take money from you and money that does not belong to them and never reimburse you. To get my money I had to argue with them and get their attitude like they had done no mistakes. I don't know where to complain but will look into it, this office needs to be audited for what they owe customers. Insurance will not go into this because it is not money they owe to the insurance companies. They would not let me see the doctor without charging me for a free visit and it was an important visit I had waited for. They do not pay interest when they hold your money for years and do not notify you. At least this is what happened to me and I am sure a lot of other patients have the same type of plan where an annual exam is free but the office was charging for the specialist copay. I am very disappointed by this office. She is old and I do not know why she is still working. By the way, with all these issues, the doctor does not care and she will not call you back when you ask for her to call you back. If I pay to see a doctor for services, it is her office and she should feel responsible for anything that happens in her office.",2021-01-18 22:27:29,517,2410,

Stopped into this place while waiting for my order to be done at Sang Kee Noodle Cafe. In the least pretentious way possible I like to consider myself a ""Bubble Tea Connoisseur"" of the Greater Philadelphia area. 

From a design perspective, I found that the inconsistency in look of the medium to large sizes was slightly bothersome- the medium size with a domed bottom and the large as pictured below. Obviously this is a tedious observation but as someone who enjoys taking pictures of pretty bubble teas it's worth mentioning. However, the cup that the large size comes in does feel rather expensive.

Now for the tea! Although it seemed that they had a shaking machine, my tea was hand shaken. I'm not certain how they decide what gets machine shaken and what does not but I did find that curious. The overall tea flavor of the Oolong milk tea was not as strong as I would prefer, however it didn't have that fake powdery flavor that some other places in the area exhibit. My tea came with amber bubbles and in contrast to some other reviews I'd have to say that they were tasty- consistent in size and chewiness. My major qualm is the amount of bubbles in the drink. Personally, I like to have enough to finish my drink so I usually order extra bubbles, but this was less than most places put in an unspecified order.

It's worth noting that the customer service was really good and it was not too busy so my drink came out very fast. The reasons I knocked off a star were the inconsistency in product packaging, the amount bubbles, and the strength of the tea. Despite all this the drink was overall still yummy and I would definitely stop here in the future, especially after getting Sang Kee.",2021-01-18 23:02:28,376,1875,

I want to note that I have been a former buyer at a different resale store, so this may have effected me shopping here prior due to brand loyalty, but also I hope it helps other yelpers considering coming here. Lemme tell you - it's worth it!

I did some research on the website, as well as their Instagram to know if I needed an appointment, their buying hours, or if there was a max item limit (you may think I'm coocoo, but these are real things happening at other resale stores due to COVID). You don't need an appointment - you can sell until an hour before close - and there's no item max limit. Excited, I went through the clothes I was looking to sell and made sure they were cleaned and folded nicely.

When I came in, I was wary about what my experience would be like (I was loyal to my old company - could anyone top them?), however as soon as I came in the buyer at the front saw me and politely took an info sheet while working with another seller and guided me to an area to get started on my experience. I believe it was the owner that was working on another buy by me that went to explain the process, as well as tell me the sale that was going on. They also let me know that if I left, they would call me after my buy was done since there were a few buys ahead of me. This was easy and effortless

I did take time to look around - though I didn't find anything, everything was in great condition and reasonably priced. Some resale stores price low which in turn are lower payouts for sellers, but everything was in reason. The store was very clean and orderly, and the gal that was working on the sales floor checked in with me and was super nice. This team you can tell works well together and wants to create an experience, without being too overbearing.

I did leave and come back after getting a call. To be honest I didn't time on if this went over or not, but I was impressed that they took the time to call as a courtesy- not a lot of places do that. Though they only took a few items, they priced in cash fairly and I opted in for cash for this time. I probably will do trade in the future - cash was best for now.
 
Overall this was a great experience. Though this location is a little far for me, I will be recommending this location over other resale stores and will try to make it out here more often.",2021-01-16 22:32:55,527,2415,

I came to NRD with chronic jaw pain and an interest in a few cosmetic options for my smile. I had been to several dentist in the past and tried different procedures but to no avail. Dr. Jones is the first dentist in my life that was able to figure out the actual cause of my pain and devise a care plan to fix the problem. Thankfully, I have been pain free ever since.
 
I also had multiple mercury fillings that needed to be remediated. NRD has an extensive protocol to prevent any further exposure to mercury. We were able to remove the fillings and replace them with safe, non-toxic white fillings.
 
After we addressed my jaw pain and fillings, we were able to move forward with veneers. One of my front teeth had always been a different shape and color from the other. I wanted to brighten my smile and create a little more symmetry. We went with 6 veneers and I now have the smile I've always wanted.
 
The team at NRD goes above and beyond for their patients. Scheduling is a breeze. Cami always greets you with a warm smile at the front desk. The hygienists are wonderful and thorough. Everyone works together to make your visit seamless.

He asked us to go back to the hallway to be checked in. Where we had a temperature check...silly because we had already entered.

Command Coffee is located at the corner of Fall Creek and College in the location that was previously a Starbucks and briefly another business before Command decided to move in. 

Command is locally owned (Yay!) and they open up at 4:30am during the week and 5am on weekends. They stay open until 7pm. They emphasize fast and healthy food options, a comfortable and clean environment, and the usual coffeehouse products including coffee/tea, lattes, cappuccinos, flat white, macchiatos, hot chocolate, iced coffee, and other blended beverages. 

I'm not sure if the interior is open yet, though they have a convenient drive-thru with the typical menu board. I will note that the menu doesn't quite have all their options - for example, there's only one size of iced coffee listed, but they actually have both 16 and 24 ounce drinks. 

If you remember this as Starbucks, much of the exterior situation is the same with ample parking, a drive-thru that starts toward the back of the building, and a building that has largely stayed the same from the outside with obvious major changes in terms of branding. 

Command Coffee appears to be a diverse organization and they have a strong racial equality statement on their website. They are supporters of NAACP. 

I used the drive-thru today and was greeted in a super friendly manner. I mean really friendly. Did I mention friendly?

They asked my name and actually were conversational in tone and while taking the order. They clearly wanted to get my order right and make sure I got what I wanted. They laughed about how basic my order was - essentially a 24 ounce iced coffee straight up. Why ruin perfection?

They didn't rush me for my order and were prepared to explain anything that needed an explanation. They do have food options - primarily healthy, light sandwich options. 

Anyway, It came in at about $3.45 if I remember right. I'd say most of their pricing is in the Starbucks range or a tad lower, though they are local. I may be wrong, but my sense is they hope to grow (I get this from reading their website), but this is their first location. 

My drink was ready quickly and the crew that I saw were wearing masks and following health guidelines. 

They have the same curb cuts and parking from Starbucks - thus, they do have accessibility. 

I'm a sucker for good customer service and this was definitely an occasion where I felt better after leaving and had a nice iced coffee. They do also roast coffee and they currently have a Colombian Peaberry that you can purchase either online or most likely in at the store. I will most likely be doing this in the near future. 

This was a fantastic first visit and while this location is a bit out of my way there's simply no doubt I'll be returning.",2021-01-09 20:55:51,572,2885,

Dumpster was never picked up on Monday, I had to call again on Tuesday morning and leave a message to make sure about the pick up, they just texted back saying they will pick up. 
I called several times Monday and Tuesday but they didn't answer until I blocked my number, so they didn't know who it was. They don't stay behind their word or service. They should be ashamed saying they are a company family. In my first contact I honestly thought we could build up a strong relationship but after the lack of customer care I can't recommend or let this incident go without saying anything in consideration to the next person or company that may read this review.

I'm writing this review at 4pm on Tuesday and yet, they haven't picked up their dumpster.
I had a delivery come to the house but the delivery had to turn around because the garage was blocked by their dumpster and my husband had to go and pick up the delivery and unload several boxes by hand because of their careless customer care.
When I was finally able to speak to someone they give excuses for their lack of professionalism.

And the male nurses in the ER all run around in a snotty little clique that is apparently interested in only treating cute young guys.  If you're over 40, don't expect them to bring you a cup of water.
I made 2-3 complaints to the patient advocates at the Memorial Hospital location regarding my mistreatment by different providers, but they never followed up by phone or mail.  They never did a thing.  
SSM will only make referrals to their own system, not to the doctor that would be best for you.
I had problems with one of their ""Urgent"" care clinics.   Last year I had a broken arm and shoulder.  I do my own testosterone injections, but I could not because I used my right arm and hand to do those.  Even though medically prescribed, when I called the their urgent care in Chatham, IL, I was very rudely told by the receptionist--not even an NP, nurse, clinical nurse manager or MD--that, ""We will not be participating in that.""  
Another time I went to their ""urgent scare"" clinic to get a vaccine booster.  I was told--by the receptionist--that they did not participate in those, either.  Isn't this a doctors' office or ""urgent care""?
Then there was the time they would not draw my blood because the sheet my doctor faxed had the dirty word, ""Quest,"" on it.  They turned a disabled person away from getting necessary lab work done THREE times--during a pandemic--because of the word, ""Quest.""  It was nice that the nurse in charge at that urgent care had some compassion and had had enough of SSM's non-sense denying necessary care to patients during a pandemic, got out her bottle of White-Out, made the word ""Quest"" disappear, and she got the labs done and processed.  No wonder she's in charge.  She must be the one who actually went to school; gets sick of senseless denials of care and gets something done.  But don't count on that from many or any of the rest.
Just go anywhere else.  A veterinary clinic would give better care and more compassion.  Seriously.

I've loved everything I've ever had from The Best Chocolate in Town, and was sad to hear they had closed.   The pop up is right across the street from their former location so it's easy to find.    The truffles are always amazing and completely worth the price.    The flavors are so creative, and they're also beautifully decorated.    I enjoyed a balsamic cabernet on this trip and was not disappointed!  

I treated myself to some holiday items that were 50% off because one cannot have too much peppermint bark or chocolate dipped cookies with holiday sprinkles.     They also had Newfangled Confections products so I also picked up a praline that was delicious!  I did some super high-level internet research...well...I looked at the website for Newfangled Confections...and found they acquired Best Chocolate in Town in early 2020.   The good news is that all products from both businesses still seem as amazing as ever and we can now do more one stop shopping for our sugar fixes....

I've bought boxes of truffles for gifts before, and if you do a custom selection, they write what each one is on a grid, so each flavor can be easily identified which is a really nice touch!  

They are open here until March, but the super nice person working there said they're looking for another location for after that time.   Yay!!   

Lots of nearby metered parking was available on a Friday afternoon, but the new garage is open and would be a short walk.

My brother has always told me about Q Mart and it was a good time to go. I've been bored out of my mind with over two weeks off from work and was looking to venture out and do something new/different.

I read the New Year's Eve hours were up til 3 PM, this is only about 30 minutes from me. It was a lovely drive through country roads for me. I enjoyed the journey.

The parking is spacious and free. Watch the potholes! They are plentiful. This reminded me very much of a cleaner more upscale version of Zerns, that finally has closed its doors forever. I'm afraid all of these markets will suffer extinction. The lay out is straight forward and one gigantic hallway. Down one side and up the other side.

I enjoyed the variety of stores and there are many that interested me, ""Tarot"" & ""Habitat"" in particular.  I especially love colorful fun new age stores with rocks, crystals, tie dye and you will find all that here.  It is cleaner than Zerns was, and many levels above aesthetically. 

The tempting smell of the food vendors was pleasant although I did not eat here. It was very tempting. The butcher counters were rocking!!

I enjoyed the stores that were interesting and it was fun to window shop. I would definitely run (not walk) back to Q Mart. One of the stores I was very interested in was roped off, ahhhh maybe next time.

It's a walk back in time & memories for me although my first time here. Reminiscent of my last walk through Zerns, reflecting on my experiences in the land of penny candy, and cones of French fried potatoes that I enjoyed as a girl with my dad at Zerns.",2021-01-01 12:08:58,340,1603,

I purchased a $400 jacket online via garmentory.com in October. The jacket arrived and it didn't fit. I returned it promptly and was told that they would be getting my size in January. I was hoping to have a winter coat in time for winter weather, which is why I made this purchase in October. It's now mid January and garmentory.com let me know that the boutique actually will not be getting this coat in and due to their ""all sales final"" policy I will not be receiving a refund. I've emailed the boutique directly (tried to call, but there is not number listed.) several times and nobody has responded to me. I happen to own a boutique and have the same policy. The difference between me and this shop owner is that I have empathy and compassion for people during this time of Covid-19. We all know how challenging this has been for everyone. I've been incredibly flexible with my customers during this time because I value their support and I want them to return. After all, they are the reason why we are in business. $400 is a lot of money to me. I needed a winter coat for winter. The fact that my money has been locked into this boutique for the past 3 months is unacceptable. To find out that the coat is actually not coming in and that I'm expected to use a store credit for something else is upsetting. Especially since this boutique only has 2 other coats available that are also not my size. I believe the ethical and human thing to do in this situation would be to refund my $400.00. Instead, my money will sit in the shops bank account and I will remain coatless. This boutique sources ""ethical"" goods, but what is the point of this if the owner doesn't even practice ethics in her own business? 
My guess is that this shop owner opened this boutique as a hobby and actually doesn't rely on customers to stay afloat. I do not feel valued as a customer and will never support this business again.

I called ahead since we would be coming in right at dinner time, and I do recommend reservations in advance since they're operating at smaller capacities. Matthew was able to get us right in. 

Drinks first - they had Baja Brewing Black Ale on tap, which was a great start.

We like to course out our dinner, and started with the Roasted Carrots. We were forewarned that these are pre-roasted and are served chilled, and were a delicious first act, as our salad. The pomegranate and sunflower seeds gave a surprising crunch, the nutmeg felt like a Thanksgiving hug, and the lebne (I was told a Turkish yogurt) is a creamy, smooth finish. Yum. 

Next, on to the Queso Fundido - I have never thought of adding mushrooms to chorizo, but it was delish. This is served piping hot in a little cast iron pan with perfect, small flour tortillas. This was easy to share, but could also be a meal for one. Put some of that spicy, cheesy goodness in the tortilla and it's like soft taco heaven. 

First main course was the Sea of Cortez Shrimp, which our server Janay generously offered to split in two bowls for us. It is described as having seafood broth but not intended as a soup, more for quantity for dipping. And speaking of dipping, you'll choose between tortillas or house made bread, if available / made that day. Since we were fresh off of the flour tortillas from the Fundido, opted for bread, which seemed like the right choice. The broth is a bit Smokey and almost Spanish in flavor. Don't be fooled - what will look like sausage upon first glance are actually the masa dumplings. While we don't have restrictions, this dish is gluten-free. 

Second main chosen was the Mesquite Roasted Pork Chop. Upon hearing us order this, a stranger passing by on their way out enthusiastically noted their support of our choice, and said we would love it. The chop was served on a warm bed of smooth black beans (sneakily looking like mole) and salsa chacahuate, and had a sweet, crisp skin. Hiding behind the chop is caramelized cabbage, and served with sliced jalapeños,  radishes,  and pickled onions. Do yourself a favor and build a bite complete with some of all of the above - chop, beans, salsa, jalapeño, cabbage, and onion. So good. 

Last - I had seen a picture of the Dark Chocolate Ganache, and just couldn't convince myself to make another choice. Served with candied Orange, a touch of almonds, and house made whipped cream...It was SO rich. So decadent. Such a perfect end to a most delicious treat of a meal. 

Thank you Janay & Team Tito & Pep! You made coming out of quarantine and getting coverage for our kiddos so worth it!",2021-01-14 22:03:59,564,2708,

I do take minimal care of it to make sure it's cleaned regularly, and that makes a world of difference in how it looks.

The process was a little bit annoying as we live in DC and didn't have a car at the time (thanks, public transportation!) so we had to rent a car to head to Philly three times--once to pick out the ring, the second time to see it in mold form (with the rock in the wax mold), and the third time to actually pick it up. I really wish they could have mailed it that third time, but if we lived in Philly or had had a car it wouldn't have been a big deal. And, if it hadn't fit we would have likely wanted to get it resized...all in all a minor inconvenience.

I ultimately couldn't find a wedding band to complement my engagement ring or a band my husband liked at Halloween, much as I tried. We ended up going to Bario Neal for both mine and my husband's rings and I love the contrast of a modern and kind of funky wedding band against what looks like an antique engagement ring. They somehow just flow together even thought they maybe shouldn't. And I loved that we weren't pressured at Halloween to buy a specific complementing wedding band or shamed for not doing so.

I understand what other reviewers have said about feeling like maybe Henri and others are dismissive in their customer service, but honestly I loved it? I feel like almost all of the other jewelry stores we looked at were extraordinarily high pressure, and here they give you enough information to make an informed decision and let you do with that what you will. That take it or leave it attitude is what drew me in. We definitely felt a difference between the engagement ring shopping--when we were very helped--and when we looked at the wedding band--when we felt pointed in the right direction and then totally ignored.",2021-01-07 17:40:53,416,1967,

In the winter of 2019 I had an over temperature switch go out in the heating unit.  It was replaced by the technician and the unit was put back into service.  He also sold me a maintenance contract, which although being a bit pricey, I thought it would be better to be proactive rather than reactive.

During the 2020 summer maintenance, the repairman was not as thorough.  He did not blow out my condensate lines although I asked him to do so.  Even worse, he suggested I replace my condensing unit starting capacitor.  It was still working but barely out of the rated capacitance tolerance so, again, I thought it best to let him do it.  The job was 10 minutes as it only has two terminals.  The cost for a 10 minute repair and a $15 part was a $300 change order to the already paid for maintenance contract.

During the winter 2020 maintenance there were no surprises.  It was noted that they could install some unnecessary valves (again very, very high cost) in my condensate drain lines, but being an engineer and familiar with HVAC units I declined.

Two weeks after the maintenance (report stated unit was in good working order) and a year after the first repair, the same switch they fixed went out again.  At this point, I have family with a pregnant tenant leasing the property from me.  The husband lets me know the unit is out so I call on Keefes.  Keefes stated the filters haven't been changed (I change them personally every three months on a schedule) and that my heating coil has burned up (that can happen but was not the case).  They then tell me that I need a new unit (it's 8 years old).  I said, I probably don't, and I ask them to check the previous repair they made.  They said it was unrelated.  I asked them to leave and I called Rob's AC for a second opinion.  Rob's pointed out that the switch they have previously repaired failed (open terminal; poor craftsmanship from the first visit).  I was also charged an additional $80 by Keefes for this visit.

With that said, I will never do business with them again.  Look elsewhere.",2021-01-13 14:52:31,442,2121,

I'm a longtime makeup enthusiast and usually know exactly what I need when I go into any Ulta or Sephora. However, I'm always open to a second opinion from staff, since I assume they are passionate about makeup to be working there (won't make that mistake again). I shade matched myself with a product I'm extremely familiar with, the It Cosmetics CC Cream. I have recently started using tanning lotion so I needed a shade or 2 darker than my usual Fair Light, and yes I knew the nature of product's oxidation. As I was reaching for my new shade one of the staff asked me if I needed any help shade matching. Since I was wearing a mask for Covid regulations and couldn't sample the product on my skin (had to rely on bottle color), I said ""sure, I wouldn't mind a second opinion."" I was then swarmed by 2 other staff members when the first couldn't decide which shade of the 2 I brought to her was best, and then one of the 3 staff members asked me if I wanted a foundation. I said no, I wanted a CC cream. She then responded to me in an extremely bitchy tone, ""what do you mean by CC cream??"" as if I'm the one with the crazy ideas. Anyone who has even an inkling of the scope of the makeup world knows that CC's creams have become very popular in recent years because of the quality of their coverage combined with skincare ingredients and SPF. Just because Ulta staff isn't aware of them doesn't mean they aren't prevalent - big brands like Maybelline, Neutrogena, NYX, e.l.f., etc. all have their own versions that are named, you guessed it, ""CC Creams."" It's not MY problem the staff here isn't up to date on trends that are already years old. All 3 staffers then proceeded to tell me neither shade I chose would work, they were both too dark. Well, the next shade up was the one I already owned that was now too light, aka the whole reason I'm in there! I politely said ""guess I must be a shade in between, thanks anyway for your help."" Silence. Not only does the staff seem to have no concept of the makeup world, they don't even know how to make a sale. I was basically left with no other product options and left the store. Jokes on them - not one person in the staff was even aware that Ulta carries CC creams from DOZENS of other brands that one of them could have showed me and I would be open to buying. Instead I was met with terrible attitudes and made to feel like a fool at something I'm actually really good at. Makeup is very important to me, I consider it an art and I enjoy every experience I get with it, including the buying experience.

kimchi noodles (4.5) - these were so good! great noodles and broth. flavor was on point. only thing missing for me was an egg, especially for the price i think should have been included

rice cake fries (3/5) - i love rice cakes so i had to try these. they were OK, i wish they had more flavor but the kimchi ketchup was a tasty add on. i'd love to see an incorporation of ddukbboki somehow into the menu instead

korean wings (3.75/5) these had a lot of flavor BUT i needed something more. either a meatier wing, or more crunch or more spice in the flavor. my go to KFC will still be cafe soho for now

short rib ssam (4.5/5)- this was my favorite dish. the beef was cooked perfectly and the kimchi relish and ssam sauce were ON POINT. my only argument is that i could have def used more baby lettuce especially for the price

rice pudding (5/5) - i normally dont like rice pudding but i saw everyone raving about these so i had to try. the flavor profile is so unique. it was nutty, slightly sweety and a dessert umami that i loved. i've never had something like this before and i hope it becomes something more frequent in my life!

Upon arrival, we decided the bar would be more enjoyable, intimate, so we found ourselves a private corner at the end of the bar.  The bartenders were both friendly and welcoming!

The bartender taking care of us poured us our waters, handed a paper menu, and gave us an intro to the whiskey/scotch/bourbon options and her personal favorite.  I'm a self-proclaimed whisky woman, but tonight I was going for a fine glass of dry red.  I let her know my palate and that I was having a fine steak.  She set us up with our beverages, and offered the night's specials.

We opted for the night's app special, crab and spinach dip with ciabatta baguettes, then we each ordered filets (medium well and medium) with our choice of sides: roasted Brussels sprouts for me and twice baked potato for my guest.  For starters (no pun intended) the dip was plenty for four though we were only two and full of fresh chunky crab meat.  Our filets were both perfectly cooked to our requests and TENDER and JUICY.  Brussels sprouts are a favorite veggie for me, and these roasted sprouts were a 10/10!  Perfect balance of outer crisp and tenderness inside. My guest did eat most of their potato, and I thought I'd have to go on only guessing at how good it was since nit wanting to share lol.  Though near the end, the kindness came and the two bites I got they were also 10/10!  The skin was salty and addictive and yummy like the turkey skin at thanksgiving, the inside potato was creamy and topped with loads of cheese and bacon and scallions.

It's nice that they don't charge extra for a split scoop like some other places. The Lemon Curd was my favorite out of everything I had. I do wish there was some graham cracker or something just to give it a little texture. The Passionfruit was vegan. Tart but still sweet and fruity. 

The second time I went I got a split scoop of the Brown Sugar Banana and the Cup O' Joe Spinelli. The BSB was tasty. It had a fresh banana flavor and didn't taste artificial. I typically enjoy coffee flavored ice cream but it was a little too bitter for my taste. My husband got the Biscoff which tasted of cinnamon and and sugar, but i found it to be a bit grainy. Not sure if they had ground up the cookies but it might have been better if they left it in chunks instead. The Strawberry Cheescake was nice as well and was reminiscent of Baskin Robins Very Berry Strawberry flavor. 

The store was quaint and clean. The employees were patient and friendly. It's a little pricey but I think they give you a good portion - basically felt like two scoops even though I got one.

The restaurant is super cute. It feels comfortable and homey and looks how you'd expect the interior of a really good, authentic Mexican restaurant to look.

Victoria was our gracious and friendly server, after the the nice receptionist escorted up to our table immediately upon entering. 
I ordered the deviled eggs with pork belly and tomato jam. What made the deviled eggs was the slightly crispy pork belly. The tomato jam was a very nice and tasty compliment. 
My husband ordered the Cajun tacos made with grouper. He liked it very much. He said only one didn't have as much grouper, and yet there were three total, and his appetite was satisfied. 
I ordered the Aztec burger. I almost order the onion soup burger, yet the Aztec had more flavors to compliment the beef pattie. The beef was very good and not your usual perfect circle. It had to be hand made. The flavor of the beef was very flavorful. It was topped with guacamole, crisp, thick bacon, roasted peppers and nice, light lime sauce. Each flavor complimented the other. Not one was overbearing. Just the way I like it!
You can't miss out on dessert. I ordered the Flourless Chocolate Torte with raspberry sauce. It is perfect for all you chocoholics! It's decadent and not too over the top. My husband said he wasn't interested in it until he had his first bite. Then he had a second, third, fourth and took nearly all of the raspberry sauce.

WFYI Public Media's mission is to ""empower, educate, entertain and connect our community through impactful journalism, inspiring stories and lifelong learning."" 

WFYI has been around since 1970 and was the state of Indiana's first educational television system. The broadcast signal reaches 58 miles, though 80+ organizations help WFYI extend its reach. According to the stats, approximately 450,000 households throughout Central Indiana continue to tune in to WFYI Public Television at least once a week, and 110,000 Hoosiers listen to FM 90.1 HD1 on the radio each week.

The studio is located at 16th & Meridian in a building that's hard to miss. If you drive behind the building, it's even harder to miss with a gigantic Big Bird destined to greet you. 

WFYI's television offerings include 3 digital options - 20.1 is the main channel, 20.2 is 24-hour programming for kids, and 20.3 has how-to programming during the day and both local and national offerings in primetime. 

WFYI's HD radio options include HD1 (the standard BBC/NPR programming along with local news/public affairs) and HD2 (somewhat more trendier programming that is also often available as a podcast). 

Having attended multiple special events at WFYI, I'm always impressed by those who work there and those who broadcast. I've appeared on multiple shows and semi-regularly on Film Soceyology. I've also had the privilege of guest hosting Film Soceyology during times when host Matt Socey has needed to be absent. 

WFYI offers closed captioning services. They have accessible parking in back and the sidewalk is level to the front door. The front doors are automatic (push button) and there's an elevator to each floor. I've seen a couple gathering spaces that required a little planning in a wheelchair, but WFYI has always taken accessibility seriously. 

WFYI also supports numerous community initiatives and you can also see other smaller media organizations in their building. Truly, they're community-minded, engaging, offer a great public forum for discussion and debate, they're entertaining, and they offer a wide variety of programming that's truly stand-out with some of the best hosts for music, news, and public affairs in the city. They're the recipient of numerous awards, including Emmy Awards, and there's no doubt Indy's a better place to live because of WFYI.",2021-01-04 22:27:57,458,2477,

We made some burgers and paired it with the jalapeño pepper spread and some goat cheese and it was absolutely delicious! I was hoping for more of a spicy kick but the sweetness paired well with the greasy/savory burger patty and creaminess of the goat cheese. The jar does show a visual of one pepper out of four, indicating a low spiciness level but we still enjoyed it and can't wait to pair it with other foods. I also can't wait to try some of their other spicier spreads!

The garlic rosemary Asiago crackers were also a hit and we found ourselves addictively dipping it into the spreads. Surprisingly the fruit spreads were a little less sweet than I expected but that's the way I like em! The commercial stuff is just pure colored sugar so we actually liked this stuff more. As you can see from the photo, we already dug into the treats but the sampler spread was packaged nicely in a bag. 

We were also gifted some chocolate covered pretzel sticks (it seemed like it was a festive/seasonal item for the holidays) but it didn't quite make the picture because.....R.I.P. 

I can't wait until covid settles down so we can travel to this local jem! There is a website you can order from but as its name indicates, it seems like they do things in small batches so some of the online items were sold out. Apparently there is a tiny shopping area behind their cafe where they showcase local goods. Based on the other reviews, it seems like the food is pretty great so I can't wait until I get to check it out in person and pick up some gifts (if it'll last that long, heh).",2021-01-13 02:04:34,342,1667,

On a positive note, my son said the blueberry smoothie was the best beverage he's ever had.  My iced chai latte was disgusting.  The biscuits were hard and dry and not flaky.  The gravy was watery.  The pancakes were tiny and tasted like frozen microwave pancakes.  All breakfast items are $3.15 each.  I would've preferred biscuits and gravy from Arby's and pancakes from McDonald's.  Then, I decide to enjoy my sugar cookies for an afternoon snack.  They were hard as rocks and look like they were made from refrigerated cookie dough.  To add to the experience, my son purchased some mini-cupcakes that I believe were from a local grocery store.  My son went inside while I waited.  He reported back that ordering was difficult but thought the cashier might be new.  He also almost slipped on the wet floor as he was entering.  Strangely, our pancakes and biscuits came in wax-like pouches instead of a styrofoam container so make sure you have plates.  I normally don't have such negative reviews but I was truly disappointed.  Hope this was just a bad day for visiting.  *I added photos of the messages with the owner.  I never faulted the interior.  I mentioned the opinion of the interior in other reviews.  I also didn't ask for a free drink.  I made the suggestion she offer free drinks to those who make complaints.  Most of the reviews are negative.  In my opinion, the owner's responses are very defensive. **I pray for this business owner, her business and family.  I understand how one may take these reviews personally because it's their business but in no way have I said I dislike her or her family.  I even said I appreciated her hiring disabled employees and that I told a group from work about the possibility of using her back room.  I corrected the pricing from my original review.  Most of my reviews are positive.  I try to give an honest opinion because I look to Yelp to make decisions on which businesses I visit.  This has gotten way out of hand.  I responded back with suggestions, updated information and corrected the misinformation she stated in her response.  I wish her luck with the business.

DO NOT GO HERE!!! have been a patient at rwwc for years at this point but I have only kept them as a primary because I haven't felt an urgency to find another doctor, but I use urgent care when I absolutely need to be seen. I have a chronic illness that they could not diagnose, they sent me to multiple specialists, and I was only ever able to be diagnosed and treated when I found my OWN specialist outside of their network (I was then diagnosed quickly and easily). 
Because of covid, I have been putting off going into any kind of doctors office (I am high risk) but I have an ongoing issue that now needs attention. I called for a sick appointment (which they give first to their ""members"" that pay a member fee, and people who do not pay to be a member, get leftover appointments), the woman I spoke to would not schedule me an appointment because they messed up with their billing and said I owed $40 (which I had paid) from TWO/THREE YEARS AGO. I said I would have to find another primary since they refused to schedule an appointment for me, she was rude the entire conversation and then agreed and said I should find another primary. Absolutely insane interaction. 
Not only have they been HORRENDOUS with my care, they have also been terrible and unhelpful with my mother, who also was forced to find another primary. The doctors do the absolute minimum, they do not listen to you, and definitely do not care. The only person I have ever encountered there that was helpful, was a woman in the dermacenter who left RWWC years ago, and the nurses/aides. The people working in the front of the office are the RUDEST people EVER. I have heard them discussing patients and their medical information while waiting for an appointment, which is horribly wrong on many levels (and I think illegal?).

As I paid for my 2008 Trailblazer December 14, 2020, the information dash had a 'service stabilitrak' message.  They said they would repair it on their 'Due Bill' sheet, plus noted the rear hatch defrost wire connection was broken off window as well as a few other items I noted.   As I drove it home, stopped for gas, the engine check light came on.   So I bring it back to them that Saturday, and they had at their mechanic shop until January 2nd when I picked it back up.  Well the ''service stabilitrak"" message was still showing in message on dash and again, when I got home the engine check light came back on.  I have left messages, voice messages, text messages, online message and I do not get returned calls, nor the ability to resolve the 4 error codes to the vehicle.  

Those error codes are PO106-00, PO108-00, P2431-00 and C0455.   If they took it to their mechanic they would have repaired the issues, but they did not.   

So now I'm leaving this review for buyers beware of buying used vehicles from Carzone.  Carfax report is nothing to guarantee such waste that I thought was getting a working lower mileage suv.   There 30 day warranty is jack-shit.   

As it stands, the trailblazer would not pass Washoe County smog with these error codes.  BAD BAD BAD - BUYERs DO YOUR RESEARCH.  Don't take their word, take the vehicle if you are so interested in to your mechanic before you pay for it.   Save you a lot of headache and frustrations as I am going thru.  One final thought on pricing - this vehicle if bought elsewhere would have been up to $3000.00 dollars less compared to their high markup price.

When trying to get an appointment I was told that is not how it works even with me already being in their systems and them having full access to my medical records so I had to basically start all over. To me that just sounds like the requirement for more appointments aka copays. 

I do like my new doctor, which is the up part to this practice, along with it being so close to my home and with COVID my location is Tampa doesn't work for me at the moment since I am working from home still. 

Recently, I called with 4 things I wanted to get checked out. I reviewed the number #1 item with person making the appointment, then asked about #2 as I was not sure if this location had a nurse practitioner and knew that would be what I would need for that issue...she quickly reviewed my 4 issues and then made the appointment. 

When I got into the room I was very surprised to learn that the ONLY thing listed on the information to review with my doctor that day was item #2 and NO, they did not have a nurse practitioner on staff, and that my appointment was only made for 15 minutes so she wasn't sure my doctor would be able to review the other concerns that day with me. 

Are you kidding me? The item that can't even be handled in their office was the only thing listed? And it's not like I still needed to go, it's not an issue where you'd need a referral to go see another doctor. I reviewed my frustrations with the nurse and then the doctor as well since I had specifically asked certain questions during my call to make the appointment. 

If it wasn't for me liking my new doctor and the close location I would be looking for another practice because I do not like the communication I have had so far with the staff so far and though working from home right now, I still have to take time out of my work day for the appointments.",2021-01-23 16:24:14,431,2050,

Don't let it fool you that it is in a gas station this place is the real deal. This location is much larger and in an old burger joint near the Nickel Plate district. 

When they first opened their second location in downtown Fishers we gave it a few times to try as they were getting used to the new space. We popped by for lunch the other day again recently and weren't left disappointed. They have a salsa bar where they make about 6+ different kinds you can eat with the complimentary chips, tacos or whatever you would like. Given COVID, they currently have the salsas in mini pre packaged sauce containers for folks to safely take back and enjoy with their meal. 

Additionally they usually have pastor on the trompo (or cooking on the vertical spinning top) that they shave off. The staff are all also incredibly helpful and friendly. We decided to get a few new items we wouldn't normally try and everything was absolutely perfect. We did decide to get something to start with this time. The Adrian's nachos had pastor on top as well as incredibly fresh, yet simple guacamole. They also allow you to get the nachos with fries instead of chips, which we tried and were nice and crispy.

For our meals, we tried the torta, tamales and tacos. The tamale meal came with green sauce over the chicken verde tamales, which were incredibly well done. Lately with Mexican food we have had dry meat that isn't crispy as well as dry tortillas, but not with Samano's. Although they have so many different types of meat to choose from everything was equally delicious. For the torta we got a thin pounded chicken milanesa, which was delicious and one of those items that can be difficult to find at most other Mexican restaurants. Lastly, just to try something with chorizo, we got an a la carte taco which was crispy, yet full of flavor. 

Advice for visiting Samano's? Come hungry so you can try a variety of items. Also there is plenty of free parking in the garage connected to their restaurant.",2021-01-02 23:52:03,418,2087,

In addition to her bad attitude, she treated me like I was completely ignorant or had never gotten my nails done before....WHEN I WAS A FREQUENT CLIENT OF THEIRS!

Most of them were small and the funfetti  was huge... seriously you're gonna charge $2.00 each for cookies like this!? Especially in Reno!
There's a wonderful place in San Jose that charges double but is worth every penny!

awful in every way. I'm very picky because baking is my cooking forte. The funfetti  was overly sugary, just too sweet, and that's saying a lot

I found out his name on the emailed receipt after we left.  
We asked for two non-alcoholic beverages and he walked away, returning less than two minutes away with our beverages. I informed him we would need a couple minutes. 
On his return we placed our order. Silently he put it on the ziosk on the table. He did ask me how I wanted my steak. Then he turned the ziosk to face us and walked away.  
Three minutes passed and my soup arrived.  
The Seafood Chowder was quite thin, had a good flavor with a smattering of tiny shrimp and double that amount of potatoes. 
The Beef Empanadas arrived next with the Conch Fritters. The salsa for the empanadas was very sweet. The beef pies themselves were flavorful and the filling was so steaming hot that it made me think they were microwaved to heat up.  
The Conch Fritters were in a clump. They fried themselves together and were not very good.  A real disappointment.  No check back to see if everything was ok.  
At this point, our empty dishes are still on the table and the entrees arrive.  
The Chicken and Shrimp Bowl with yellow rice in a sofrito sauce would have benefitted by completely cooking the shrimp.  They were quite underdone and opaque.  
The Steak Churrasco with Chimichurri Sauce was a miss as well. The requested medium rare steak was over cooked. Their version of chimichurri was apparently placing fresh parsley on top of the steak.

On top of that, they noticed a frame bolt missing from my 2019 1260 Diavel and started to strategize on a simple fix to get me home safe!!!

I filled out the application, waited for a worker to have time to come take me to a meet and greet with the dog.  Walking back toward the kennels with the employee, I asked about the face the dog's kennel card had a very small note of 'quarantine' on it.  The worker stopped in his tracks, turned to face me and said very formally that he had to tell me the dog had bitten the previous adopter in the face.  It had been adopted, the new owner and it were standing in the shelter lobby, the adopter leaned down to adjust the dog's 'cone of shame' from being neutered, and the dog lunged and bit him hard in the face.  The dog had been in rabies quarantine for 2 weeks re: the bite, hence the note on its card.  That note was the sole indication on the kennel card - which I read carefully - of the dog biting anyone.  I only asked about the note because I'm a detail person.  The employee - the second employee I'd spoken with about the dog, if you count the desk person who gave me the adoption form - apparently had not intended to mention the dog's history of attacking people.

In 2019, I went back seeking a kitten.  Specifically a kitten, as we had a dog (not from this shelter) and needed them to adjust to each other, which is easier when one is a baby.  I went there twice, they never had kittens.  Which is fine, I get it, sometimes there aren't kittens.  What bothered me was the odd behavior of employees and volunteers when asked if they had kittens.  It's a simple question, right? A reasonable sort of thing to ask in an animal shelter.  But every time I asked it, there was a sort of startled response.  The first time, I wrote it off as an odd individual, or maybe me being overly sensitive.  The second time, though, I asked, the person laughed without answering, then called out to a fellow employee/volunteer across the room ""She's looking for a kitten?! Haha!"" and the other person immediately joined in, something like ""Oh, kittens!  She wants a kitten?!""  The thing is - they never actually answered me.  

So it's a strange and deceptive place.  One last thing - those glossy new show kennels in the front lobby, where they highlight about 5 dogs?  Don't walk too close to them.  The second time I was there about a kitten, a volunteer brought out a shelter pit bull for a walk, and they passed in front of those kennels.  One dog inside tried to attack the passing pit bull, and slammed into the plastic wall of its kennel so hard it buckled.",2021-01-15 21:25:36,552,2540,

The company followed up on my initial 3-star review. We talked on the phone and discussed all the matters. It's a pleasure to know a company that cares about customers' experience. They provided a partial refund due to the extra expenses I had in renting a separate truck to finish the move. Overall, EverSafe is a small but super-dedicated company. To add some of the positive experience of the move (which I glossed over in my original review):
* They did not damage any item or any walls in both houses.
* I called 2-3 times before the move asking spicy questions on damage responsibility, etc. Each time that took the time and explained everything (full responsibility on damage to the house).
* The movers delivered everything in the rooms we had marked boxes for.
* They showed on time, with a very good moving truck.
* They were nice guys and asked if everything was going well several times.

The incidents below can be easily fixed now that I know the owner cares (he even searched for a truck door monitor to place in the cabin to avoid future incidents).
Would still use this company in the future. Just... you know, keep an eye on the move and the work the guys do because after all moving is never a magic process that can happen without supervision.
------------------------------

ORIGINAL POST
I moved an ~1000 sqft house, rather small. The move went overall ok, they showed on time, and the truck was very good and versatile for moving. Three guys were enough.

Two major incidents happened.
1. Eversafe asked for a list of things to move before the date, which I gave. I managed to move myself some of the delicate stuff, and threw away two beds which were on the list. Part of the items on the list did not have to move anymore. But I had few other items from the shed outside which could perfectly replace the listed items. I even showed the entire house before the move. They loaded  the truck in just a couple of hours and then refused to take the items from the shed outside, with the pretense that the items were not on the list. Trying to convince the group leader did not work. As a result, EverSafe did not move my entire house. I had to rent a separate pick up truck and move the rest of the things myself with a single ride (you can imagine there weren't a lot of things left there). And guess what, EverSafe finished the move earlier than quoted (in just about 4 hours). The guys seemed to want to finish quickly, at the cost of leaving the customer with an incomplete move. 
2. I decided to follow their truck between the two houses (15 minutes drive). Lucky me, as I saw the backdoor of the moving truck opening and flying around while the truck was riding in major roads. They endangered people, cars, and risked to lose the cargo on the street. I honked like crazy to make them stop and close the truck door. If I wasn't there, my belongings would have fallen from the truck. I expected some sincere apologies when we arrived at the new place, and their leader simply seemed to not care that the truck door. At first he did not say anything. When I asked him what went on, he simply said to me ""Ah, I thought I locked it"", and that's it.

Giving them 3 stars for the benefit of the doubt, but I think they might deserve only 2. It was an acceptable experience that ended well with some extra cost and headaches on my side, but the EverSafe crew was not that different from other moving companies after all. They do not seem to care about the customer. Just get the money, finish quickly, and who cares.",2021-01-06 22:39:29,757,3544,

Terrible experience! I went there and found the perfect car, agreed upon a price, put a $500 deposit on it and signed a sales agreement. There were a few scratches on the car that we're going to take a few days to fix so they said I could pick it up the following Monday. In the interim, I sold my current car to a co-worker who needed a it for her family, with the expectation that I would be getting a new one and transferring the tags etc on Monday. Saturday, I get a call from the sales guy telling me they are going to sell it to someone else coming from out of state and they are paying more money. What!! This is insane! How is this even possible? I was there in person, put a deposit down and even on the sales agreement, we had Monday as the date of purchase. he said, ultimately they made a mistake in the price and needed to sell it for more because the repair on the scratches were going to cost more than expected. I would've bought the car with the scratches in it if that was the case. The salesman told me he explained the issue to the owner and ultimately it was the owners call. He apologized and said he agrees that it's a messed up thing that happened. He told me he would refund my money but beyond that there was nothing he could do. 

This experience really screwed me over. it took them almost 2 weeks and many phone calls to refund my deposit, so, I couldn't put it toward another vehicle till I had the money. I ended up having to rent a car on my credit card to get to work for two weeks before I found canother one. 

I have every single thing documented. text messages, signed agreements, deposit receipts. It all means nothing. None of it legally holds the dealer accountable to sell you the car or make things right.",2021-01-08 03:39:35,379,1762,

The service was fast and attentive. Which wasn't too hard because we were the only two in the place. It was extremely cold in the place too. It was the quality of the food I have an issue with. The fish was old. It wasn't fresh. I can imagine this place probably doesn't get much business so I feel we were getting left overs from the night before. The shrimp was gross. It had a overwhelming fishy smell and taste. We weren't even given the correct shrimp in the rolls. It was all crystal shrimp instead of the tempura shrimp that was supposed to come in the rolls. I used to work in a sushi restaurant so I know the difference between the two. Both cucumber salads were old and wilted as well, without any sauce in it. If there was sauce it was without taste. I couldn't finish any of the rolls and my friend couldn't eat hers either. The don tons were good. Unfortunately we didn't stay to try much considering the horrible fish and we didn't want to waste food. The chef made us both something special, which was nice and had the chance to be really good but he used the old shrimp in both rolls. We couldn't even eat it. So with two uneaten rolls we didn't order more. The water and soda both had weird aftertaste to it. Probably from the ice. With so many ACES places out there you really need to step your game up! I know times are hard right now, but you should never use old fish when serving sushi.",2021-01-08 00:29:17,332,1516,

I made reservations (highly recommended)...we were seated promptly and our waiter, Richard, greeted us promptly.

The staff are following all the current health and safety mandates.

Let's talk about the food...I'm a huge fan of Asian cuisine and know my way around the many different styles offered here.

We ordered Dim Sum for appetizers:
Pork and Shrimp Siu Mai...Ginger Soy Dipping Sauce ($10)
Shrimp Har Gow...Ginger Soy Dipping Sauce ($10)
Shishito Peppers...Toasted Sesame Seeds, Yuzu Ponzu ($8)

I've eaten at some of the best Dim Sum restaurants around the nation and they do this style justice.
Both the Siu Mai and the Har Gow were very tasty, but, there were only 4 pieces in each steamer basket for each order! For $10? Very disappointing.
The Shishito Peppers were a welcome treat...perfectly blistered and the Ponzu sauce was an extra added taste option to dip in. A generous amount on the portion. As always, I managed to find a couple of the elusive spicy ones.

For my main course:
Korean Spiced Beef Short Rib (Rice Bowl)...Daikon Radish Slaw, Kimchi, Marinated Soft Boiled Egg, Ginger Scallion Salad, Pickled Shiitake Mushrooms, Korean BBQ Sauce ($17)
The Short Ribs were tender and nicely seasoned, the Kimchi had just the right kick to it and the Daikon Radish Slaw, Ginger Scallion Salad, Pickled Shiitake Mushrooms, as well as the Rice were a great compliment to the dish, adding a nice variety of texture and flavor. Unfortunately, the Marinated Soft Boiled Egg was overcooked and the center wasn't runny to add the unctuousness to the plate that would've been welcome.
While very tasty, still a bit overpriced at $17 for the portion size.

One of my friends ordered:
Yakitori Chicken (Rice Bowl)...Daikon Radish Slaw, Pea Shoots, Ginger Scallion Salad, Pickled Shiitake Mushrooms, Marinated Soft Boiled Egg, Peanut Sauce ($18)
Again, the Marinated Soft Boiled Egg was overcooked and the center wasn't runny. I didn't get a taste, but, he said that he liked it while also commenting that he thought it was overpriced at $18 for the portion size.

My other friend ordered:
Pho 775...Shaved Beef, Beef Tendon, Beef Meat Balls, Bean Sprouts, Scallions, Jalapeños, Thai Basil, Lime, Shaved Onions, Cilantro ($18)

FYI...before I comment, please know that I've (literally) eaten at EVERY Pho joint in this area! It's one of my favorite foods.

I did get a taste of the broth...meh...nothing special...plus, not near enough Basil, Cilantro & Jalapenos...and they were already added into the bowl, instead of being served on the side so you can add it yourself, which is half the fun of eating Pho! They also didn't offer or bring the standard condiments that are served at every Pho place around...Hoisin Sauce, Sri Racha, Chili Sauce and Chili Oil. It was a nice sized portion, lots of broth and noodles, but, AGAIN, overpriced at $18, especially considering the amount of protein that was in the bowl.

The food is good.
The prices? Not so much.
In my opinion, it's over-priced for what you actually get.
Our waiter, Richard, was the bright spot of the evening...very attentive and personable, without being overbearing (which, if you read my reviews, is a pet peeve of mine).
I've seen a lot of reviews complaining about long waits for food and food showing up cold/lukewarm...we didn't experience those issues at all...maybe because we ate later in the evening (our reservation was at 10pm).

Since it's brand new, I'll give them some time to settle in and see if they make adjustments to either their portion sizes or their prices to make it equitable.

Go see for yourself...",2021-01-15 02:15:29,809,3776,

It appears if you have an issue, you're inconveniencing him. I recently went back because I was in the area and had a gift card to use. I went in for a dip powder manicure. It was clear from the beginning the tech did not know how to do a dip manicure. She dipped multiple fingers more than the others...which makes the color darker than other nails. They were so chunky because she didn't drill them to smooth them out. I said something... then all the chatter came about that I could not understand .... and come on it's clear you're being talked about, but whatever. The total cost of what I had done was $50, so not cheap and I expect decent work. The tech has an attitude huffing and puffing... why? I expect a service, which is being paid for. At this point I was in there 2 hours, I just wanted to leave. I went up to the front to pay and was followed by the tech, who literally stood there waiting for her tip.. tip?! I left with a horrible looking manicure, a huge headache. I did tip her but I will NEVER visit this nail salon again.

Her experience, warmth, and also her candor were major selling points for me, and I have absolutely zero regrets about hiring her not only for all four days, but for ancillary services like touch-ups and second looks as well. And I'm forever grateful for this woman because she kept me alive through what I didn't realize is going to be the biggest whirlwind of my life. And I'm not exaggerating about keeping me alive - she balanced Sprite and cut fruits with touch-up make-up to keep my blood sugar and make-up balanced throughout the day. I'm going to guess no one's bridesmaids (including my own) will or will remember to do this for you; it doesn't make them inconsiderate people, most people just don't have decades worth of experience helping a bride navigate the minutiae of their wedding day like Mar and her team does. But digress, her ancillary services are just another example of Mar and her team's dedication to excellent work and attention to detail in all aspects of HMU. I look back on photos and I still adore all the looks we crafted together. She made me feel effortlessly beautiful on my wedding day and helped me glam it up on other nights and they all photographed exactly as I wanted them to. Their range and ability to nail any look is truly phenomenal. And last, but certainly not least, Mar and her team are consummate professionals. They were always early AND finished early which is super important for wedding timelines. You'll likely need that extra time buffer for photos; I think we allocated 3 hours pre-ceremony and still needed more time which Mar's timeline thankfully provided; side note I also recently heard a horror story about a bride who's established HMUA did not budget enough time and left the bride for the end and couldn't finish her bridal make-up - can you imagine?! Taking in all these factors, I felt TEAM was well worth the price and honestly fell pretty closely in-line with the other vendors I vetted.

They also do everything in house or over at the actual hospital. Do not believe High Risk when they say they are the only ones with the high resolution sonogram machine, Renown and Saint Marys also have them and their obgyn practices have access to them!

We were scheduled for a Sat 1pm ride and I had checked how long it would take to get there in the morning but by the time we headed out, there was a lot of unexpected heavy traffic which would put us about 15 min late. I texted then spoke to Charlie, the manager, to give him a heads up and he was very accommodating... Part of the group had gone ahead as scheduled but the other part of the group was also running late so they got us a separate guide with Tori which all worked out great!  (FYI - Charlie is direct and has dry humor which we found hilarious so don't be put off... He's really a nice guy!) 

My wife rode Koda and I was on Haze. Haze is a great horse who was kept at the head of the pack as he was fast and liked to run and gallop ahead of the rest which after I figured him out, was a lot of fun! Koda was a little slower than my horse and a bit stubborn so you have to be a little more assertive which my wife had no trouble with and had fun on too. So just go into it knowing that each horse has its own personality and character traits.

Our guide was Tori who's an expert rider with many years experience riding horses and knows how to handle any situation. Her own horse was jittery and got spooked a lot but she handled it like a pro which was amazing to watch. We really liked her; Tori's very knowledgeable and she answered all my questions as we were riding.

The ride was beautiful! My wife especially liked the ride down the road from the stables as it was very scenic and peaceful. And I enjoyed the ride along Loon Point Beach.

Unfortunately, Jamba Juice is not a hugely popular chain in my area, so this is not a place I would return to on a regular basis, despite many of the positive aspects of my experience here. I have been very interested in smoothie bowls for a while now, and although I know that this isn't the focus specifically at Jamba Juice, I did notice that they had a small selection of smoothie bowls.

I decided to order a ""Vanilla Blue Sky"" smoothie bowl because I saw that it was the bowl with the lowest calories. Only 330 calories for a beautifully-colored bowl with bananas, pineapples, unsweetened almond milk, vanilla coconut milk, blue spirulina, organic granola, strawberries, blueberries, and coconut chips? It sounded excellent to me. It also tasted really, really good.

As a side note, I am suspicious of the calorie count being only 330 calories, as this is likely the lowest I've seen for any smoothie bowl, ever. Nonetheless, the smoothie bowl was incredible and it made me look into purchasing blue spirulina for my own smoothie bowls that I make at home. The prices at Jamba Juice are also better than many mainstream smoothie bowl places. Even at full price, this bowl would be $3 cheaper at Jamba Juice than at other establishments.

I don't specifically have a reason to come back, but if I was in the Willow Grove area for any reason, I'd consider stopping here. Some downsides are that they close super early; it was just before 6 PM and when I walked in, the employees were cleaning up the place and preparing to close.

HVAC - 5 stars

Electrical (COMMUNICATION/CUSTOMER SERVICE/ ONLY)- 2 stars

I'm overall at around 3.5 stars with this company. I'd recommend the HVAC and handyman tasks (small/medium handyman jobs). I did not use them for electrical so it would not be fair to give them a rating on that. What I am rating is the communication/customer service around the electrical services advertised.  

Initial - The first time they came out to do estimates on various things in my house, a tech showed up along with the owner Jack. That appointment went well. Jack went out of his way to explain and recommend various things particularly with the electrical tasks such as indoor/outdoor light fixture and motion light installation, doorbell installation . The major project I needed help with was a demolition of a large built in entertainment center and shelving, and once all of that stuff was taken down, there would be some re-wiring / repairing / replacing electrical receptacles in the wall. When they left I was under the impression that  I was covered with them for these projects which was a combination of handyman and electrical services. I received the estimates for some of the tasks within 24 hours.

Handyman - I did hire them to do the demo on the built in which i considered to be a large project. Gary and Spence showed up and based on their initial reaction to what they were looking at,  it seemed like they were unaware prior to arriving the actual size of the task, however they did a great job of figuring out how to take it all down and overall I was very pleased with the hard work they did.  They were also very pleasant to talk to.  I learned that Gary's specialty was HVAC and I actually ended up signing him on to do HVAC work later in the week. 
Again, I think they did a great job taking it all down, but it seemed to me that there may have been miscommunication from their dispatch and these guys not expecting to be doing such a large demo job. Given the effort they put into this thing, I wouldn't have any concerns with recommending them for smaller to medium type handy man work, but if you have a fairly large project that you are thinking to use them on, I would suggest making sure you are on the same page with them on what exactly needs to be done and confirm with them that they are willing to take on the task and ensure it is passed down to the techs who will be doing the work. On more minor point but contributed to 4 stars, they told me they would provide a referral for a drywall company to fix my walls after the demo and that never happened. Minor,  but at a time when there are many companies competing with each other for business around here, these little customer service things can make all the difference. 

HVAC - No concerns. Gary came by and spent a couple of hours making sure my air handler in the attic and the outside unit were in good shape. He cleaned out a bunch of leaves that had accumulated in my outside unit, and spoke to me about the things he checked on the units. Good conversations.  Certainly a recommend for HVAC maintenance. 

Electric -  During the initial visit and handyman demo, I was given the impression that the company would handle my wiring needs. Also,  despite a couple of follow ups where I had to reach out to them, it took a while to receive an estimate on on a doorbell system. After receiving the estimate I saw that the estimate was just to install a chime with no wiring. More importantly, my main project (rewire after handyman demo) I never heard back regarding estimate to work on the wiring (which I've since gotten taken care of by another electrican). After the handy man demo project, Gary took several pictures of what was behind the built in and indicated those would be sent to Jack for a wiring estimate, which I never received. Based on the doorbell estimate not including wiring, no estimate received for the wall re-wiring project, and the recommendation to use a battery/solar powered motion light outside instead of a wired in light,  I've come to believe that they don't do  wires or maybe didn't feel comfortable with the scope of some of my wiring projects, and that's fine, but don't mislead me to think that you are going to do wiring work  and have me wait it out for an estimate that never comes. I've no problem if a company tells me ""we aren't comfortable doing this wiring - here is a referral""  Their web site does after all advertise that they can handle all of your re-wiring needs. No harm no foul though,  I've since found out about some great electricians in the area.

Other - Their customer service point Christine is pleasant to deal with. They send a snapshot of their techs prior to arriving. 

Recap - They are totally fine for handyman and HVAC.  Not so much for electrical in so far that the communication around what they can actually do with electrical is lacking which seems to conflict with the services advertised on their web site.",2021-01-13 23:21:23,984,4980,

They only have take out right now and are not have any dine in customers.  They have a few parking spots out front.  They seem few and far between and there is a lot about a hundreds yards away that have quite a few more spots. I think a 4.5 star rating is more accurate for this restaurant. I decided to go with the 4 because it came close, but did not meet a 5.

The menu is on the wall and they have some laminated paper menus if that is your flavor. They have pork chops, chicken, ribs and a wide assortment of sides such as mac and cheese, dressing and fried corn. They also have desserts that include cobblers and sweet potato pie. 

You place your order through a small tinted glass window, but it is difficult to hear because the music is banging.  I liked the music personally, but it was a bit too loud. You pick your order up from a small window to the left of the one that you placed your order.

I order a fried pork chop diner with stuffing and sweet potatoes.  Like i said, they do not have dine-in, so I had to take it to-go. It was smelling so good that I could not make it and pulled over at a park and chowed down.  The pork chops were delicious, as well as the sweet potatoes.  The stuffing was ok, definitely not my fav.  

Since I was there and had no dinner plans, I ordered another meal for later. I got the fried chicken diner with the greens and cabbage mix and the potato salad.  The entire dinner was delicious.  Some of the best I have ever had.  The chicken was perfectly seasoned fresh. The greens and cabbage mix.....wow......I should have gotten a tub of it. I am still thinking about it.  The potato salad is mustard based and was packed with flavor.

I did have to wait a very long time for my food, but I know that you can't rush perfection.  I would highly recommend placing your order online (you won't have the loud music drowning you out) or call it in.

With everything being online now a days the app made it really easy to online check in. We could add more towels, shampoo, conditioner, razors and even pick the type of pillow and blanket you wanted for the room. I thought how cool as we are a family of four girls, so we use a lot of hair products and it was nice to have this option. 

Well, I went ahead and added two extra conditioners a razor and two extra towels. Upon arrival the room was very clean and we loved the floors because they were wood. I check the room for the items I reserved online but they were not in the room. Not a problem I called down to the front desk as by now the kids had already used the 1 bottle we had! They said, ""no worries we will have it up to you shortly "" . Did think twice about it. Long story short they never came. The next morning we asked again for the items but this time if they could clean our room as we were headed out for the day.

We returned and they never came to clean the room. Which we had to request because of covid. They also never brought the conditioner and razor. So I tried calling the front desk and the lines were down. So I walked down to address the issue. Asked if they could bring fresh towels , clean the room, and bring the items we requested the day before. Needless to say we never got any fresh towels, never got the conditioner, shampoo or razors and our room was never cleaned!!

I don't feel I asked for much, the staff was friendly but didn't follow though. The only reason they received two stars is because the lady at the front desk with short black hair was very sweet and helpful to my wife during check out. We didn't complain or even tell her about our experience because we were leaving at that point.

They dropped it twice, scraping my landlord's paint and punching a hole into drywall the first time.
The second time, they dropped it from their truck which was 5 feet high.

They have a very complex process which they try to trick you with. Corporate will tell you it's $1 per 1 pound for a reimbursement of a broken item (If they believe they cannot repair it). This wasn't even the only thing they damaged, just the most expensive.

After 3 or 4 exchanges with the manager and snotty remarks from the mover, they reluctantly settled on $6 per 1 pound. We signed the contract and paid thinking they would file a damage report like they said they would.

They did not. 3 weeks went by until we contacted them and we are no closer to resolving our issue now than we were before as they are now blaming US for not making a damage report. At first they said they had no idea about our treadmill problem then slipped up in a later email and claimed it was a small amount of damage. I have no hope of receiving  the damage reimbursement anymore but I can still warn some of you.

The day of moving they slammed us with extra details that were never mentioned in our emails. They cannot take your tv or wall mount down for you, you must do it. They won't do it.

If the government siphoned tax dollars into creating a sub-par moving company, this is what the company would resemble. You would have better luck shipping your items with USPS ground.

You don't have to believe me but it is your money and valuable furniture on the line. Learn from my mistake and do not go with this company.",2021-01-21 02:14:41,425,2032,

Sometimes the chef is out or maybe they are out of an item or maybe the oven isn't writing properly.  Bottom line, I WANT people to succeed. That being said, a couple months ago a friend of mine ordered a pizza and while it arrived on time... they are less than 1/2 mile away... it was burnt. We were sitting outside enjoying the last of the warm weather and just shrugged our shoulders and decided that they were having a bad day. - Probably a lot of people were ordering pizza and sitting outside enjoying the weather and the oven was too hot... or something. 
Then yesterday we decided to give them another chance. We ordered our food, told them that last time it was a little overdone (trying to be nice) and was hoping it wouldn't be burnt. 
Nope.
The picture I attached is 1/2 pepperoni and 1/2 Hawaiian. You can tell them apart but can you really tell that the one side is pepperoni or did you just think it was cheese or maybe sausage? 
This time they were called. 
Was an apology given? No.
An explanation? No.
We may as well have been talking to an acorn. No response. Finally after saying that we wouldn't be ordering from them anymore we got a response.  ""Okay.""
Then they hung up. 
Pathetic. 
Sorry. If you had at least handled the call better then I would have given you a third chance. 
Instead I'm spending my time and effort telling my friends about my TWO experiences.
I'm not even gonna talk about the hockey pucks...I mean toasted ravs that we ordered.",2021-01-07 03:57:23,327,1522,

We placed a rather large order for takeout last night. We I collected it at the appropriate time I was given one bag. Asked if it was the entire order, and was told yes. I wasnt thinking as I had a lot on my mine. When I arrived home. I discovered that I had about one half of my order. I called and a young man said that yes, the other half was still there. I was about 20 minutes away, and I asked fo they could ensure the food was kept warm until I got there, he said ""I will see what I can do"". 
When I arrived to collect the second half I stood at the check in point for about another 20 minutes. A gentleman in front of us was having some difficulties and did not receive all that he had ordered. The lady responsible the take out orders went back to the kitchen to retrieve his food, and apparently stood back there for the entire time the food was being prepared. In the meantime, the collection point is immediately in from of the check in desk for the restaurant, There were three people manning that desk. NOT ONE came to ask if they could help[ (turns out the second bag was still there in the original spot and one of them could have  discovered that (including the young man that would see what he could do and told me on the phone that he had seen the bag). The attitude was seemingly, ""not my department"". So after 20 minutes the young woman in charge of the take out desk returned, dispensed with the customer in front is us, recognized me, brought the bag over and handed it to me without eye contact and not one word of apology.
Throughout this ordeal, there was no sign of management. In these Covid times, what has kept many restaurants going is take out orders. With this kind of management that may soon loose a significant chunk of this business. I ask again, where is the management?",2021-01-31 14:08:16,414,1928,

The room was lovely with a great partial view of the ocean and a cute trail. We had a balcony that was pretty big!  It was raining part of our stay but either way it was nice. Valet was attentive and quick every time. Staff wore masks every day. 

Now to the downside of our experience here. The room although beautiful smelled dirty. It had a smell of mildew or wet dog. Not sure how often the carpet is cleaned but the smell was annoying. 

We came here to celebrate our daughters 21st birthday. We were given a room with one king bed. Sadly for us, we were told that that was all they had and a rollaway would be a good option. That was fine at the end of the day and didn't make a fuss since we didn't want to ruin our daughters weekend. 

Then yesterday I went to buy my daughter a cake and flowers. Mind you our room was at a distance so I went to wait for my ride. I asked a gentlemen to have someone take me. He said no problem! Then I'm waiting a few minutes and a couple came behind me. Well the ride guy came, skipped me and went straight to them and asked if he could assist them and gave them a ride to their car. Seriously!!!!!???! I had been waiting , my back was hurting and my bags were heavy. I was furious. This is unacceptable! Walking was not an option for me since it was far, it's downhill, and floor was wet and yes I was in pain! 

I complained to another person who came by and he said he'd talk to him but I was so upset and in pain I wanted to cry. This gentlemen was quick to take me to my room which I appreciated.

So when I pulled up to the window the cashier demanded $10 for what I ordered and I kindly asked if she put in the order correctly because it originally said that it was $7.38, and she rudely responded no it's $10 and that she didn't put in the lemonade originally which is total BS because the lemonade was already in the order. I know for a fact that it was not $10 because I've ordered this same exact order from many different Taco Bell locations and it always ended up about $7 including tax. 

Another problem is that when I got home I noticed that the order wasn't exactly the way I wanted it and there wasn't any hot sauce in the bag! Unreal! If you're gonna ripoff your customers at least get the fucking order correct!! And yes I made the mistake of not checking the bag to make sure my order is correct before I left because trust me if I did I would've for sure made my presence known. I understand that the people working there don't make jack shit for profit, but its crazy how some people are that desperate to rip off people over 3 dollars and to get their order wrong. SAD!!

Originally, I was trying to be nice but seeing how the owner wants to continue to debate facts or defend something that wasn't attacked as I simply stated facts this rating has progressively gone down as my experience has continue to deteriorate. The things she reply to my review (on her edit) are just downright incorrect/lies/non-truths. I feel bad the technicians will lose business because of the business practices of the owner.  My experience AFTER the visit during the back & forth from my honest review has been terrible & now instead of leaving an honest & nice review I will actively make sure nobody I know ever goes to this spa & I will be sure to spread the word to others as well. Never in a million years, as a business owner myself, would I treat a customer the way she has treated not only me but other who have left less than a shining review for her biz. That should tell you everything you need to know about this business. End of story. Don't waste your time. I've wasted enough of mine. 

Original review:
The technicians seemed somewhat knowledgeable however, the atmosphere of the waiting room and the treatment room were less than desirable. A little TLC could make a huge difference. Paying spa prices I want the whole spa experience & that just isn't offered here. We won't be going back.

First response:
This is in response to the owners reply to this review. I'm not talking about nuts, berries & flavored water. That would most likely only make the waiting area even more cluttered. There is an ATM machine as you only accept cash for tips (something that should be revealed ahead of time on the phone vs waiting for the client to show up then having to use the ATM. The room is also heavily cluttered with other 'crap/junk' for instance there are big CBD signs stating it's sold here, jewelry is sold there & shoved in a corner (looks junky), Buddha's everywhere (I mean everywhere; too many). Feels very cluttered & junky. I felt like I was being sold to vs walking into a relaxing atmosphere. It's not the experience I've had previously at other spas & one I don't want again.  Sadly, I brought 4 others in with me. We are all in search of a new spa that resembles what you expect for this kind of business. I had picture but sadly deleted them as they would show just how cluttered the atmosphere is. Wish I would've saved them for this review.",2021-01-14 13:52:07,497,2434,

No matter how good the food is, it is impossible to dismiss what is seen on the floor, in the corners or on the back of shelves around the retail space. So it was with Wicked Bagelz in Westampton, NJ.

This is the third iteration of a bagel breakfast/lunch joint at this location since I have been regularly attending court in nearby Mt. Holly (although all court business is now done online due to Covid-19). The predecessors had a problem maintaining operations, although each had reasonably decent round bread. I was sorry to see them close. 

Wicked Bs has a cool name and a witchy Halloween decor. Manmade spiderwebs were draped over furniture, etc. The women working were friendly, and the bagels looked good in the bins behind the counter. I arrived late for breakfast and most of the choices were gone. I snagged an Everything Bagel with Veggie Spread. It was thick, round and boil/baked with a darker flour that added a rich flavor to the dough. It was very good.

But, as I waited I began to look around at all the decorations. My vision eventually reached the floor. I noticed it was dirtier than expected, like it hadn't been swept in days or longer*. I then saw that there was black crud along the molding at the base of the display cases, coffee station and tables. Plastic bottles of soft drink lay on the floor near their cooler, and hadn't been put into the fridge. It was obvious that no one was seriously cleaning the front of the house. I didn't want to see the situation behind the counter, nor the grill area. 

I became more grossed out by the total slovenliness as I thought about it. No matter how tasty the bagel, the lack of concern for the health of their customers was offensive. With Covid-19 everywhere, such filth was just unacceptable and way beyond the pale. 

One and done!

*Management sent me a message denying these conditions exist. Unfortunately, my observations were accurate. The black streaked moldy baseboards were a sad fact and hadn't been touched in a long time. There was no spill to report, and would have been if it existed.  Regardless, I understand defending your business, and I will visit again as suggested. If conditions have improved, I will amend the review, and thank you for being a responsible owner.",2021-01-16 21:46:29,467,2319,

I wanted a bangle and my teen daughter wanted to look at some charms for her bangle. She is a huge Pandora fan and has about a dozen rings, a couple of bracelets some charms and other things.  We always try and go to a store wherever we are to pick up an item.  We got in line outside the store.  The sign outside said no more than 6 customers at a time.  I believe there were 5 inside the store when we got there.  One of the sales associates came up and greeted us and asked us if we knew what we wanted.  I told her sort of, we knew we wanted a bangle and wanted to look at some charms.  A group of three or so people left the store leaving 2 customers in the store. 10 mins go by and I finally ask the associate why they aren't letting anyone else in the store and she informs me that the group that left 10 mins ago went to the ATM machine.  Slightly irritated we continue to wait.  A few minutes later the associate comes out and tells me that the manager told her to let me know that the full face shield I am wearing is not sufficient and that I have to wear a face mask.  Not wanting to argue with the associate over the fact that the shield I was wearing was sufficient at the not only the resort I was staying at, and on the casino floor, but also every other store in the mall. At this point we have been waiting for about 20- 25 mins and since the manager was either sitting behind a desk or in the back out of view I asked for her card.  I didn't see her reappear after that. The store managers name was Sarah.  When we're finally allowed into the store we were told we had to go to the x at the counter.  We were the only customers in the store.  We were told we could not walk through the store we had to stand right in that spot.  I got the bangle I was there for and my teen decided that since she didn't know exactly what she wanted she didn't want to have the associate keep bringing trays full of charms over to the counter.  Had she been allowed to walk through the store I'm sure she would have ended up leaving with at least one or more new jewelry items.  We walked exactly about 2 steps into the store and that was all we were allowed.  Super frustrating! The service was definitely not what I am used to. Normally we shop at the Roseville Galleria location in CA where we have probably some of the strictest Covid mandates and although they limit the amount of customers in the store and ask you to stay with the same associate,  they still allow you to move through the store and look at things. The customer service in our home location is 10x better.  I will never go back to the Reno location.  Honestly I probably would never return to Pandora again if I hadn't already had such good service previously.  Maybe the Roseville staff should go and train the Reno staff on how to not alienate customers.",2021-01-27 01:57:42,618,2947,

When I heard about Casa Santo Stefano and Richard Gonzmart's vision for this restaurant, I began patiently awaiting its opening. I had the opportunity to celebrate my birthday there a few weeks ago with a (slightly rowdy) group of 12. 

A little background, a friend of mine booked the reservation but there was some confusion. We were under the impression our reservation was for 8:30 pm, the restaurant thought it was for 8pm and had given away our table by the time we got there. Not a worry though because it gave us a chance to take in their rooftop bar and enjoy a drink. 

They had a table for us soon enough and our waitress couldn't have been more gracious dealing with a group that was already socially lubricated quite a bit. 

The meal was incredible. I ordered some appetizers for the table including the arrancini  (top notch), the calamari (absolutely perfect) and the Sfinciune. Everything was perfect, and I can't recommend the food enough. 

For my main I enjoyed the linguine with clams. It was also absolutely perfect. My only regret was I didn't have enough room left to get through more than a quarter of the dish. 

Lastly, it was most important to me to ensure we had the most famous of Sicilian desserts, the canoli. I have been living in Tampa 4 years now and this is the first canoli I've had here. It has been far too long. 

The menu is a nice blend of Sicilian American and traditional Sicilian dishes. Many people don't know that because of Sicily's history of being conquered it's lead to a wide array of influences in the cooking including Greek, Arabic, and African flavors being added. It's nice to see a degree of authenticity, such as the scaciatta and oil before the meal. Dishes like the Bucatini con la Sarde (which I didn't get to try but absolutely will next time I go) show a real effort to recreate the dining experience one would have in Sicily, as opposed to just presenting a watered down American version of Sicilian food.

Loved it, can't wait to go back.",2021-01-21 17:26:16,419,2048,

Heading to the local beach for a walk and checking out another place to eat is another.  Stopped in for a quick pre Sunset meal at the Bait House.  Very happy to see Covid-19 guidelines were being followed from check in for a table to the end of our meal.  Observed staff cleaning and wearing masks.  After being seated initially, it was an uncomfortable wait for anyone to notice me, even though I was seated very near the bar and in the middle of the dock seating.  I finally made myself seen by waving down one of the happily cleaning waitstaff.  I guess during these times you can never be too clean.  The staff member let me know my waitress would be there soon and several more minutes passed.  At this point I was getting a little upset, I had a Sunset to catch and I was getting hangry. Finally my waitress arrived and apologized for the wait, I had been sat at a table that was not to be used in the evening during Covid seating.  Reviewed the menu and made my selections.  I started with a Red Sangria to overcome the long workday woes and left me disappointed.  I ordered the Seafood Cakes and they were absolutely delicious.  Full of flavor and moist, all while melting in my mouth.  The Clam Chowder mug, had a good portion of clams and tasted good. I would have enjoyed it more if it had not been so thin and not room temp outdoors.  The fish tacos arrived and at first glance I was a tad overwhelmed.  I like to taste and see the fish and the cabbage was the prime ingredient.  The fish I did taste was delectable, moist, and perfectly seasoned.  The sauce was flavorsome and I gladly would have eaten it as a side or as dressing on my salad.  Overall, I left with a mixed review.  I will be back to see if service will be improved and if I can have more fish in my tacos next time.

I spend a lot of my time watching beauty content on YouTube, and I find makeup to be a creative and therapeutic outlet for me. Unfortunately this Sephora was no such experience for me. I'll start off with a positive and say that the crew members that greeted me up front were nice, and I even briefly talked to one about the new Rare Beauty launch while waiting to go in the store. Once I got inside, it was a different story. I completely understand their policy about not touching the displays of makeup and not having tester of skincare out. However, my friend picked up a roller ball from a display of perfumes, and was instantly berated. The employee that told her to put it back was rude about the situation. Why have those out if you aren't allowed to touch them? She didn't pull down her mask to smell the perfume, and glass/plastic bottles can easily be sanitized. A few minutes later I ask for a sample of a hair care product only to be told they were unable to give one to me. This goes against their usual policy of allowing up to 3 samples per visit. In comparison, Lush gave me a sample of a scalp oil without me even having to ask! Sephora couldn't even give me a perfume sample. Since they couldn't give me a sample of a perfume to try out, I asked if they could spritz my wrist because perfume can smell different on your body as opposed to paper. Even that was not allowed. Instead I was handed a dripping wet perfume sample paper to the rub on my wrist. I'm all for covid safety measures, but this is just ridiculous, especially when the same employee was the one checking me out at the register. This is easily the least welcoming Sephora I've been to.

I drive about 35 minutes to the shop, and I will not go anyplace else. Ann is the Tech I always book with, I've had a few others do my pedicures and each one have been very professional. My manicures with the dip powder last 3/4 weeks and I work in a food warehouse. I've never had any issues with my polish ever. I enjoy coming here because of the calming atmosphere. There is never any fussing, complaining or clients acting less than professional. The shop provides a service, Andy and Ann own the shop and you can tell by the way they treat their clients. The last time I visited was in December before Christmas and there was an older lady trying to pick out a color of polish and I'll guess she took around 20 minutes to decide, once they began applying the color it wasn't what she thought is was, the young lady stopped, helped her find the color she actually wanted and began again to paint her nails. The patience the tech showed the older lady was heart warming, so respectful. They earned my business from the  day I walked in. They also did my daughters entire wedding party, and again the level of professionalism was remarkable, the bride was a bit nervous about color and matching. But, the techs were calm and respectful and had no issues with request for a more "" nude"" color. Again, if you want a professional nail salon Geist Nails should be your go to shop.

He sweetly made reservations for 7:00 but we couldn't make that so he ended up changing to 8:00 pm.  We showed up right on time and the hostess sat us at a booth because that's what we wanted in the moment.  After we sat down we quickly realized the huge, round, copper, BRIGHT light hung way too low that we simply could not make eye contact and the glare was blinding so we asked to switch to the lovely table nearby.  Our waiter was a bit upset about it at first but he eventually changed his mood and was nice again.  

We were SO happy to have changed seating, why sit somewhere for a nice and expensive dinner to be uncomfortable?  Make the move if you can, don't be shy! 

To start we had the crab cakes, duh.  I had them years ago at the prior steakhouse in the Tamarack.  They were very good but very different than before.  Not sure what they did to change them up.  Bread basket - awesome, salad with pecans or honey walnuts - awesome as well.  I wanted red wine but nothing stuck out to me by the glass on the menu so we both ordered Manhattan's because are true connoisseurs.  The Manhattan's were tad sweet to my liking but still drinkable, gave me a definite buzz.  

Obviously I had to order the sea bass because I'm Reno's # 1 critic of the local sea bass options and have to try it everywhere I dine.  You guys, it was SO delicate and flaky and delicious.  It's a must!  Definitely tops my three around town.

We seriously had a blast, of course, my company always makes the best experience which adds to my rating.  Needles to say, it was very quiet this night and I realized our nearby neighbors at a booth were old friends of mine, so it was nice running into people I knew.

I was taken back on time with my appointment i made a month ago- that was the only good part! 
When i said hello she refused to answer me and never said hello- just told me to sit-
When i told her i prefer my right arm - she insisted on using my left arm which is my ""bad"" arm- well after 3 sticks - she never found the vein and i started crying begging her to stop! She then got FURIOUS and threw her equipment down in the tray and demanded i move to another room- and that another employee would help me. Mean time i had 3 sticks and was bleeding and she said they had no bandaides to give me- so i was out of luck.I waited and she came back and told me to give a urine sample while i wait - i walked into the bathroom and it was a mess- no toilet paper to be found- no tissues either. When i went back out she told me to ""figure it out"". !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I went back to room #2 and she came back in and said she would do it but i must move to room #3- (mind you she never wiped down any rooms - no mind or care that this was during a pandemic). She then draws blood from my ""good"" arm and during the entire draw she berated me telling me she has never had such a difficult patient!!!!! Imagine my fear- while she has a needle in me!!!!!!

Being a pescatarian, I am shocked, I have never heard of this place. Located in downtown Zionsville, parking was pretty tricky, but the brick building is decorated beautifully, maybe still from Christmas. We had requested a booth, but we were given the option of a half booth and table or a table by the bar. Because we had our children with us, we chose the 1/2 booth, which was in the middle section. They did an excellent job of distancing the seating so people feel safe dining indoors. Our server seemed a little overwhelmed, I'm not sure if he was worried bc we had kids there or the busyness of a Friday night, so I didn't catch his name. My son ordered the California sushi roll which was delicious and gorgeously plated with lobster covering the roll. Both my children raved about the calamari, it was their first time trying it! They also ordered a burger - medium well, and that was the only downside, it was brought out medium rare? My daughter was unhappy with the ""juice"" (blood) on the plate, so we ended up boxing it up and taking it home. My husband enjoyed the mussels- which is the reason we came for his birthday, and I purchased the coconut crusted mahi mahi!!!!

The burger and the servers annoyance towards my children is the reason for only 4 stars. He probably didn't know that not all kids eat chicken fingers and overall, my kids were very well behaved. We had a great time and plan to return for all special occasions but I would be happy for once a month.",2021-01-12 18:26:43,365,1734,

Upon walking in, the place is small but beautiful. Very modern looking with bright white walls and several bright pink boxes lined up behind counters. Touch screens are along the walls and at the register. The smell is intoxicating too, SO good. The gentleman at the counter explained what cookies were currently offered, showed my friend and I how HUGE they were (and how much smaller the catering options are, in case we were ever interested), and explained the best sellers. We went with a 4 pack, which is $11+ tax. Pretty good deal since again, the cookies are huge and $3.50/each. The touch screens are easy to figure out and pay with when using a card (you can even add a tip there). You can even sign up there for points/rewards. You enter your name so it can be called out when your order is ready.

We went with carrot cake, sugar cookie, peanut butter chocolate chip, and lemon poppyseed. They were shown to us once my name was called and the box is really cute, nice touch. I didn't expect anything magical but boy was I wrong. Everything was good but the chilled sugar cookie is magical, honestly the best cookie of my life. Mind. Blown. I'm drooling just typing this...

I drove by on free cookie day and decided to skip it. The weather was freezing and the line was down the block, around the corner. I was happy to see online orders still being run out to cars but waiting hours for one free cookie wasn't worth it for me.

I went back a couple days later before a road trip to my home town to show off how amazing this place is. Still busy, I waited outside but only for about 15 minutes (only 7 customers are allowed inside at a time due to Covid). This was the day I realized I should do a review and recommend NOT bringing small children here. I know, I know, it's a cookie place, but you're likely going to have to wait a bit, it's very small and easily crowded, and I learned this day that the place echos so kiddos who are tired of waiting have their screams echoing very loudly. I love kids but do yourself and others a favor - leave them at home or do a curbside order for now until they aren't so busy. It's a bit too hecktic for the littles.

Overall amazing place! Check out their social media for their rotating menu but definitely grab that sugar cookie, YUM!",2021-01-19 04:05:05,534,2494,

The lease allows 20 people over so they can attempt to PROFIT off civil noise complaints that any call to police across the street typically resolve.  Also, bait and switch on the lease signing bonus of $500 though it's listed on the actual lease.  They also don't apply rent as you direct on their portal.  They apply rent payments to UNENFORCEABLE non-out of pocket expense ""lease violations"" first so your rent ILLEGALLY appears to be late every day a result. LAW MAX =5%. Move-in condition has many things missing or damaged that they already billed tenant that moved out and if you don't report out on the move-in sheet, they will attempt to profit off new tenant tho they never replaced or repaired from the last tenant.   TVs did not work, remotes missing.  These are easy things that should have been checked especially on the expensive Suites before move in rather than making us wait until the maintenance person returns from being sick?  My roommates and I were billed for the replacement of a perfecting working microwave that we had requested the handle be repaired.  $1600 for a furnished 8x10 bedroom keeps occupancy low so they make up the loss in a sheet long list of items.  Garbage overflowing on roof deck daily.  Bait and switch advertised security guard on website w/o concessions which I see they removed from the website now so just the office phone # in the lobby rather than a person to receive parcels so many of ours went missing as they are left unsecured in the lobby until someone from office collects them.  Lobby attendant moves to rooftop office after parent dropoff weekend. Would be nice for instacart , Grubhub deliveries & noise complaints if they reinstated but not happening with a $1,000 per occurrence profit on the 65 units.  Small mailbox is shared.  Water service required as it tastes too salty.  Apartment Key FOB is nice.  Most units don't have full-size refrigerators.  No ice makers or trays.  Maintenance repairs are done fairly promptly.  Noise is mild.  Garbage chute is too small. Wifi is ok. Location is central but a homeless park is across the street.
 Need floor lamps and no overhead lighting.  Some fun organized activities. There is no TV on the roof deck as advertised on the gallery photos.  Bring extra long shower curtain or water gets on the bathroom floor.  No Airconditioning or cooling fan only heat and the summer months are unbearable.  Windows are not double-paned.  Though a room with a window was unoccupied all year, they refused my repeated request to move within the unit. They will not share security video of guest coming out of your apartment ringing doorbells so you can make sure they never return as they want them to return as you guessed it another attempt at $250 fee x 4 in the unit.  Parking is tough.  The free stand up paddleboard they offer is too heavy to carry to the beach.

We had read a few books, followed some dog people on Instagram, and talked to our friends and family about their experiences. We were confident in our plan. Then we picked him up, and he had clearly not read the same material we did.
We struggled with demand barking, puppy nipping, pulling like a sled dog on the leash, jumping, flopping to the ground when he didn't want to come inside and more. A friend recommended we check out Opportunity Barks and we called right away, practically in tears, because we thought we would have to give our puppy back to the breeder. From the moment we made contact, we felt like we were being heard and that the staff understood our needs. Alyssa enrolled us in Day School Foundations, Ingrid taught us privately about the importance of life rewards and on Saturdays Leigh taught us all the skills we needed while Churro was working on being a calm, relaxed, attentive dog at school. Not to mention the countless Puppy Socials we attended to get Churro feeling confident around other dogs.
When Churro started Day School Foundations there was a noticeable difference in him. More importantly, there was a noticeable difference in us too. Each day when we picked him up the ladies at Opportunity Barks shared their wisdom, their experiences, book recommendations, equipment suggestions and more. Each time we needed an equipment change Alyssa took the time to work with us to make sure we were all (Churro included) comfortable using it.  
All of this said, the highest regards we can truly give is that we have sent countless friends, family and dog-owning strangers directly to Alyssa and Opportunity Barks.  Two close-in-age puppies started Day School and Puppy Foundations on our recommendation.  Additionally multiple veterinarians at our practice have been so impressed with the farm program, training philosophy and Churro's ability to ""be a dog"" despite living in the city.  We have learned how to enjoy our lives and be enriched by our puppy with the right tools and techniques instead of feeling held hostage by him and his behavior.  There is not a single dog-parent we meet that we don't sing Opportunity Barks praises to!",2021-01-12 01:37:07,430,2266,

I was thrilled when I had such a good dining experience. The decoration and ambiance is second to none. Anyone who has eaten at the Columbia restaurant or ulele knows this restaurant group spares no expense in truly creating unique and immersive dining experiences. The parking lot across the street also makes dining very easy. We started our meal with a blood orange margarita and a lemon drop martini and no complaints about either. They came quickly after we ordered which was great given how busy they were. We skipped appetizer course and were given bread prior to the meal. It's a nice touch that each person gets their own piece of bread and olive oil. I also had the insalata mista to start. It was your basic side salad that was a nice way to start a meal. My only downside is that it was a little warmer than I typical want my salads. Our entrees we had the ravioli do ricotta which were very good. The pasta seemed a touch thick on the raviolis but it didn't take away from the meal. The filling was rich and the portion was generous. The bracioluni was a speciality I had never seen on a menu so we tried it out. It was very good and a great menu item for those looking to branch out from the typical spaghetti or penne a la vodka on an Italian restaurant menu. The dessert we tried was the cassata siciliana and it was my favorite part of the meal. It was just the right amount of sweetness to finish off the meal. Casa Santo Stefano is worth the visit for the experience and a good offering of Italian food.,2021-01-13 04:55:26,335,1655,

But life is short and I can't take my money with me, so why not support a local shop so that I can feel good about my indulgence.

And when I tasted my purchases, I knew I had done well.  Whether it was the dark chocolate covered pretzel with just enough salt to contrast with the sweet; or the milk chocolate almond clusters that have a distinctive bite/break when you try them; the chocolates were some of the best I have had.

I also saw a vegan and gluten free Toffee Peanut Butter Cookie that I would have normally passed on, but the flavors are some of my favorites. So I bought it.  Wow!  I've had just enough lousy V/GF cookies and baked goods that I was leery that this would be a brick.  But it wasn't.  It had just a bit of crunch and didn't sit heavy in my belly.  And the flavor was just what I had hoped for. It was a darned good cookie!

On my most recent visit, I decided to get a 6 pack of chocolate truffles.  They had some preselected options, but I chose to build my own.  The problem is that once I get them home, I have trouble remembering which truffle is which.  So, the clever person on duty pulled out a card and drew 6 squares and wrote down the names of my selections in the order that she placed them in the box.  So, as long as I didn't spill the box, I could identify them.  I only had one white chocolate selection in my order so that made it easy to orient and choose a flavor I wanted to start with.

Treat yourself right today and you can spend the rest of the week walking it off.  That's my plan and I hope I stick too it!

The online reservation platform was nice, I mentioned that I had the coupon in the notes section. Usually I will call when I have those coupons to make sure they will be accepted. Well- when we got there we found out that the owner was not accepting the coupons. 
When we walked in the place looked really cool and Italian rustic. I felt like I was whisked away to Italy for a super second. We got a seat in the far back and it was pretty romantic. Then I started looking at the fake plants... there was a good layer of dust on the false vegetation. I had to use the restroom and noticed the plant in there was pretty gross too. The toilet took about a minute to flush, holding the handle the whole time... good thing I only had to #1. 
Our server Lindsay was... amazing! She was very sympathetic and understanding about the coupon thing- ended up comping our beers. Hope the owner doesn't get on her for that. I almost had a feeling he was like the owner of the Cobra Kai building...
The gentleman who seated us was also very friendly. 
Now to the food! We ended up sharing the beef rib ravioli, it was super good and rich. I filled up fast after bread and Caesar salad. My husband was still a little hungry. He had been working all day in construction and was a hungry man. I almost took him to the street taco place around the corner after dinner. 
The eggroll meatball app was pretty good- a little cold. The food came out lightening fast and we were surprised that our whole dining experience took less than an hour. Maybe if we each had a pasta dish we would've stayed longer. I noticed another table asking for boxes for their pasta and when Lindsay brought the plates for them they looked pretty big. 
I'll go back for sure, but want the owner to pay more attention to on-line reservation notes. I would've really appreciated a text or call letting me know that he wasn't going to accept our living social deal. I had two of them! I ended up trading them for something else.",2021-01-23 17:31:35,437,2106,

I was fine with that, so I left my car there. A few days went by, and I didn't hear anything, so I called. I talked to one of the mechanics, inquiring about my car and this was his exact words, ""We are still looking at it, we will call you."" That was a week into them having my car. I said okay. A few more days passed now. It's now two weeks and I still haven't received a call on my car. I called, and told them I'm coming to get my car because I haven't heard anything. This is the good part, I get there, and request to speak with the owner. There's one customer inside the building. He then goes to get my car, and brings it to the front from the workshop. He then asks me to come out outside to talk to him. It was 40 degrees that day, and very cold. He didn't want to have this conversation in their office with the other customer hearing it. He then tells me that they don't work on the inner parts of a transmission. I told him that's fine, but why didn't anyone contact me within those two weeks? None of your workers called me to tell me anything. My car was in your shop just sitting. The worst part was, he kept accepting new cars into the shop, while mines was just sitting there. I know this for a fact because my fiancee called to get her car worked on while mines was just sitting. They told her to bring it in. After, what I went through she didn't. His excuse was ""we have a lot of cars here."" Horrible customer service!!! He didn't want to have this conversation in the shop with the other customer around because; he didn't want to scare them off. If you do right by people, you shouldn't have to worry about that. They clearly just care about the money, and not the customers time. That day they lost two customers.",2021-01-14 07:22:44,436,1866,

CSS is the newest Italian establishment by those who run Columbia Restaurant. It is situated in ybor city in a grand redeveloped factory-turned-restaurant. Approximately $11 million and 4 years went into this place, and my goodness was it worth it. You enter and walk into a large open kitchen and wood fired oven, and a huge open dining area that makes you feel like you've stepped into Sicily.

Every item is hand crafted and fresh. We were given individual bread and olive oil with herbs. The bread is wood fired I believe or placed on some sort of clay oven- it reminded me of a fresh, fluffed pita bread or naan. 

We started with the eggplant appetizer (aunt Lily's caponata) and which reminded me of a small stew with crunchy celery and fresh capers. This was delicious with the bread. We also had the Sicilian bread which was perfectly crunchy on the bottom and soft on the inside. The only thing I would say is that it was baked and became a bit dry on the top, but we used our olive oil to take care of that.

For main course I had the eggplant (millefoglie di melanzane) which I so appreciated. It was a steamed layering of eggplant with melted mozzarella in between. Nothing fried or battered. It came with a side of fresh casarecce pasta in a pomodoro sauce.

We also had the ravioli which was arguably the best meal in the place. It was filled with not just ricotta but also pesto!! This made it rich but not overly cheesy.

Our server paired the ""planetta"" wine with our primarily tomato based dishes and I tell you, I could taste the grapes.

We finished the night with a panna cotta which could have been made in nonna's kitchen. It was topped with a layer of berry sauce and was just perfect for the end of a meal, and not too sweet.

After the dinner we saw the upstairs room which is apparently going to open soon. It was filled with  wine bottles and looked quite small so I'm curious what they intend to do with the place.

I highly recommend this restaurant for any date night or for celebrations/grads. The best part about it is that it is quite affordable than what I was expecting to pay when I first walked in. I appreciate that they kept prices in mind and truly have a vision for this to be an upscale cultural experience enjoyed by all.",2021-01-02 15:26:16,477,2345,

I was craving a bagel this morning and their photo showed a bagel so I was sold. But when I got there, after viewing their menu, I changed my mind. There are only three types of bagels; everything, plain or wheat and the only cream cheese I saw advertised was either plain or onion chive. That doesn't count against them for my review, but I was craving either Asiago bagel or strawberry cream cheese to spice up a plain bagel. I did try the avocado toast with tomato. I liked the added tomato on top. A tad bit heavy handed with the balsamic drizzle but that's just me I think. Others probably would think it's just fine. I've added a pic for reference. 

It is a small place and while sitting here watching people come and go, you can tell there are many regulars and the staff remembers people. I over heard her say to one person ""I haven't seen you in awhile"". There was an avid conversation with another customer and it was evident by the conversation, she was a regular and they both knew the same people. 

The only complaint I have is the front staff was wearing her mask dangling off one ear the whole time. I don't know if she simply forgot to put it on properly or just hates wearing it. Both she and the customer were having a long conversation at the counter, and neither were wearing masks. The customer kept walking back and forth between counter and her table, both talking non stop. Another staff member working in the back came out wearing her mask but didn't tell her coworker to mask up. I understand you don't have to wear your mask while sitting at the table eating, but I would like to see better practice of mask wearing, especially if you are in the business of serving the community.

The food was okay, but the bill was absurd to be eating on styrofoam with a plastic fork.

She had another employee come with a broom, and they started moving furniture in a panic trying to catch it, but I've lived in Florida my whole life, and killed it with my napkin for the employees, who were struggling. She said she'd go talk to her manager and see if they could get rid of our 3$ surcharged (total bill 47.83, for only the two of us.) The manager did not even come to speak to us. Just stayed there leaning on the bar doing nothing. Not the way to run a business. We were only refunded 3$ on the bill. Don't eat here. If there's one roach, there's more, especially if they're willing to leave the darkness as that's a sign that other secluded dark and damp places are overcrowded. Believe me, lived with several infestations. Probably caused by not cleaning or closing properly at night. I still am in shock that the manager didn't even come to apologize, as my pregnant girlfriend basically leaped out of her seat. There's much better food for much less money, where you'll be treated better, and have a much less possibility of eating a roach or roach feces. Don't go here.",2021-01-14 03:45:18,315,1450,

We pay $40 a month to park our two cars in the ""private"" garage. Over the holidays at the end of the year, my registration expired. Unfortunately, we weren't home. By the time we got home, it had slipped my mind. We have a 3 month old baby and my husband is freelancing two different contracts since he lost his job due to COVID cuts in 2020. 
Saturday 1/16 he got our mail, and there was a letter from COMMTOW LLC that they had towed my car on 1/7/21, from the private garage we pay to park in. We immediately called the location and the only person you can speak to is a dispatch manager who doesn't even live or work in the area your car was likely towed... She could provide zero information other than it had been towed and I needed an appointment to pick it up. I asked to speak to a supervisor because while the car was towed on 1/7, they neglected to communicate the tow until 1/12 (FIVE days later) when they finally put a LETTER in the mail ...USPS... to me. It is WIDELY known that the USPS has been experiencing significant delays for months now, since before the 2020 election. Why is that their only form of communication IN ADDITION to the fact that they sat on that for FIVE days, accruing $125 in additional fees on *just* my car. It was nine total days from the time they towed it until I received notice. Nine days of fees at minimum $25/day.  It is absolutely insane that they would be legally allowed to remove someone's car from private property they pay to park at and take five days to send communication that the car was towed., but the Slade pays them to do this. AGAIN - I have a new baby, that car is our second car, it does not have a car seat, so we *rarely* use it. I'm not an inconsiderate citizen who chose to park somewhere they were not authorized to park, nor was I seeing how long I could go without renewing my registration. People forget things. We're 10+months into a global pandemic and moved 1100 miles to florida and had a baby, my car registration expired around New Year's Eve was NOT on my mind, and this disgusting company profited significantly off a simple oversight. Instead of communicating with people, they let cars sit on their lot so you HAVE to pay them more money to release the car. Heads up - DON'T PAY WITH YOUR DEBIT CARD. Use a credit card and dispute, these assholes are robbing people blind and using incredibly unethical business practices to profit off their tows. FINALLY, the woman who I spoke to in dispatch as well as the idiot at the junkyard assured me that emailing commtow@outlook.com would ensure a prompt response to my concerns. It has been 10 days and 3 emails later from me, zero response. I'll be filing official federal complaints on their business.

Also, if you happen to be looking for somewhere to live, DON'T move into the Slade. They literally have a contract to make money off of having residents cars towed, meanwhile employees park in handicap spots for entire days without issue.",2021-01-27 00:54:50,638,3060,

Walked in and all 4 guys in the kitchen area were not wearing masks (although there is a sign on the door saying masks are required) and the girl at the front was wearing hers under her nose (I guess she was absent all of those days in school when you learn the nose is also a part of the respiratory system)

EDIT:
Read comment by owner below.  Never denies staff not wearing masks or following guidelines.  Only comes back with a snarky reply... clearly he never majored in business in college. Responding to reviews defensively or attacking the reviewer (who gave an honest review of the pizza not being good) is a way to deter people from coming who actually read the reviews and replies by the owner.

Most of his replies to bad reviews are to be combative.  Also, I read that he's born and raised in Florida... maybe if he went up to Brooklyn or NYC & ate actual good pizza (which I have for 45+ years and why I CAN qualify my opinion), he would know the difference.

For as much as I am enjoying the owner's responses, he has yet to address the fact that 4/5 employees were not wearing masks & that the 5th one didn't know how to wear one properly. Also, as per his meltdown, never once did I ever mock Floridians,  I am however mocking him for his inane response to people from NY  or Northerners saying the food is better... he has never lived in NYC/BK to know the food so he is making an argument with ZERO basis of comparison. Some people can't grasp basic reading comprehension or how to form an argument when comparing two things. It's understandable. 

I would have given his pizza an average 2.5 star review, because that's what it was. Average at best. What gave him the one star is the total disregard for people's safety by his staff. I will enjoy coming back here periodically to see his meltdowns over other bad reviews.

For those of you who may not be aware, ashiatsu uses the therapist's feet to achieve deep muscle strokes. I know some people are averse to feet but this was by far the most restorative massage I've ever had. At Nola Bliss,  your body and eyes are carefully draped so you don't actually see the feet at work. Several times throughout the massage, I was left wondering just how my therapist, Oddessa, was able to achieve such pressure -- were my feet capable of such magic? (Rhetorical question.. no, they are not). 

Even though my husband and I both wanted massages, we like to have our massages done in separate rooms as opposed to couples' massages. I wouldn't exactly classify an ashiatsu massage as romantic because of how it works out the knots in your body so I'm really glad Nola Bliss was able to accommodate this request. Booking on their website otherwise was very easy and they responded swiftly to my e-mail about booking two separate massages at the same time. 

The studio has done an incredible job with COVID precautions; you actually have to be beeped into the building, wash your hands on the first floor, and then take the elevator up to the actual studio. We were promptly greeted by our therapists and taken to our respective rooms in minutes. The check-in process was greatly expedited as we had completed all of the necessary forms online. The prices are also very affordable in my opinion. 

Special shout out to Makenzi and Oddessa for an amazing first time ashiatsu experience. Massages by hand are so...a thing of the past. We will certainly be back!

PS -- they also offer hand massages in case you aren't up for giving ashiatsu a go!",2021-01-03 21:26:26,365,1818,

My son called Bancroft about a unit that was advertised on their website. He was transferred to a leasing agent and left a message since nobody answered. This happened for four days with no return calls and the receptionist did not have any information on the unit. Finally, on the fourth day she told my son to drive by and see the property first (understandable) and to locate the maintenance person. We drove out, couldn't find any indication where the maintenance person or anyone else that could help us lived. When we're driving out of the property, we saw a sign that read on the bottom: To view available units go to (apartment number) We went back, knocked and nobody answered. We decided to go to the Bancroft office to see if there was a leasing agent available to show us the unit or at the very least to get more information. With the pandemic, we understood if we may not be allowed in the office. My son called again while I was driving us to the office. Same receptionist answered, was again not helpful and it didn't seem to matter to her that my son had called many times with no information given than to find the ""maintenance man"" and not even an apology that no one had returned his call. She repeated the usual ""I'll transfer you to a leasing agent"" that he heard so many times before. Sure enough, call went straight to voicemail. After leaving a message and while we were parked right outside the office, my son tried again to call and it went straight to voicemail, not even the receptionist answered. By this time I was agitated. While driving away we noticed at least five cars total between the front and back parking lots, as well as two men standing in the back. But not one person that could pick up the phone and answer our questions. After discussing the situation with my son we decided to go back to the property and leave a note at the apartment number that was on the sign. We left a note with my cell phone number. Within 30 minutes I received a phone call from the person at that apartment. He was a very kind gentleman that agreed to show us the unit in 30 minutes, the time it took us to drive back. He was very informative and answered all our questions. I do not understand how the receptionist did not even have the apartment number that we would need to go to for assistance--not even that. Nothing. If this is how unprofessional and rude Bancroft is with people looking for a rental, I can just imagine how unavailable they must be to an actual tenant. I'm just sorry that my son was treated so rudely and this being his first experience. But we did end up looking at another unit the same day. My son called My U of A Rentals and spoke with Alba, who gave us information on a unit we called about, which wasn't going to be ready until August. But being the professional and helpful person she is, let us know of another available unit and offered to show it to us as soon as we could meet her at the office. Imagine that! She helped restore our faith in just basic customer service. Thank you, Alba, you're amazing!!!",2021-01-14 13:38:17,657,3168,

Was hoping to sit outside given COVID but it didn't seem like there were TVs out there so we sat inside. It wasn't busy inside during our stay (4:30-7:30ish on a Saturday). I will note that several servers/bar staff were not wearing their masks over their nose, I even saw one repeatedly take her mask down to talk to people so if you are more cautious I cannot say this location is the best about those precautions. There was hand sanitizer stations everywhere which is nice. 

My party of 4 started off with drinks which came quickly. They have a wide selection of beers and other options for those who prefer cocktails or wine. Our waiter was very kind and offered suggestions and brought samples of beer. He came around a good amount with respect to the drinks. 

After awhile, it was time for food!! Food was good but SO slow. Not sure if they were just trying to get us to drink more or if someone was out in the kitchen or what but it took forever and it wasn't like the restaurant was full and backed up. Now, we were there to hang out for awhile but it certainly would have been frustrating otherwise. We got the giant pretzel which lives up to its name--giant! And yummy. It came with mustard and beer cheese, both nice accompaniments. The other couple got the mahi mahi tacos which they enjoyed. We had a crispy Buffalo chicken sandwich with a side of tater tots, all of which was good. 

Overall, WOB is reliable. Alcohol, food, and tv options that will please the masses. With that being said, service can be hit or miss it seems.",2021-01-17 04:22:20,336,1610,

OMG....they have any and everything covered in chocolate.  As a gift we could choose a free truffle and my choice was keylime truffle and all I can say is....I have never had any but a chocolate truffle.
I picked keylime because I think it would be something different and something I have never had.  When i bit into that truffle I only thought oh my I need to get a picture of this goodness and I stopped and took one of the inside because I wanted you all to see just how creamy and smooth it was, it had a true keylime taste and the dark chocolate was a nice asset to it. 
As i looked around at all the other treats they had in the store dark choc, milk choc, white choc that covered pretzels,  cookies, carameks and much more they even had pralines but i seen a sign that said caramel/bacon and who does not like bacon and caramel but have never had it together so i had to buy 2 to try. 
I didn't know if it was a caramel with bacon flavor or what.....but let me tell you, furst the caramel is a nice and smooth texture that's an easy chew, don't stick to your teeth...and when I tell you i bit into it and it had REAL pieces of bacon...I had to take another bit to make sure ...delicious.

EhSU--Wor6UAqt9IABcZUQ,YJKfrtmUA95Zy_-B-D-2lw,HQYrDpxKB4nMBuH2t56Hng,5,2,0,2,"My husband gifted me a year long membership to Massage Envy for Christmas. I used to get massages frequently when I managed a salon and spa as well as through the Massage Therapist program at TMCC. This was possibly the best gift I ever received!
I booked my appointment online originally which was an easy, but very detailed process. I like that you can select options to really customize your massage experience. You can select the amount of pressure, areas to focus on, add hot stones or other accompaniments, etc. I called the day before to confirm my appointment was in conjunction with my membership, and the receptionist made the appropriate adjustments. I do recommend booking in advance as the dates do fill up quickly. 
I booked an appointment with Bre for a 60 minute massage with medium pressure. She was very friendly and made me feel comfortable right away. She told me if I didn't want to talk to let her know, but I didn't mind. We had a great conversation and she told me I didn't look even close to 49 years old which made my day!  The massage was great with the right amount of pressure and focus on my problem areas. I felt much better afterwards and can't wait for my next appointment!
The ambience of the spa is nice and it is very clean. The front reception area has a small retail area which is brightly lit. COVID-19 precautions are in place including social distancing in the lobby, temperature checks before entering the building, masks required (this includes during the massage - I wear a mask all day at work so I didn't mind or find that it detracted from the massage), completing a COVID-19 form online before your appointment, mobile check-in from the car, hand sanitizer is available, and you must wash your hands before your appointment. Inside the massage room, the lights are dimmed and the table can be warmed if you prefer. There is a chair and a hanger for your clothes and personal belongings, and a mirror so you can hopefully try to do something with your hair afterwards!  The lights are brighter after the massage is over. I got the impression this happens on some sort of timer, but I could be wrong. 
Bre met me outside the room after the massage and walked me back to the reception area. The receptionist was very nice in helping me complete the paperwork for my membership and booking my next appointment. I highly recommend Massage Envy and can't wait to try their other services (they offer facials too!).",2021-01-23 19:45:38,486,2456,

My daughter had 2 friends over and the girls wanted to eat somewhere cool. I remember seeing on Yelp's Facebook that there were several places with neat outdoor seating and Heartbreaker was on the list. Sadly, the girls chickened out of eating outdoors, but our experience was still awesome!

This neat little spot is located in Irvington and sits off the road. Luckily for the outdoor dining options they had, I didn't drive past it. 

The inside has some cool lighting features, but isn't anything to write home about. Because of the current pandemic, seating is limited, so I would love to see the whole layout one day. They did an excellent job though of spacing out and having only every other table open, hand sanitizer available and reminder notes for social distancing. You can carry out also if you so choose.

The menu was simple, but there was a great variety (including vegan options ). I chose the plant-based Phoney Coney (so glad I did) and fries, my daughter got the loaded fries and burger and her friends got the grilled cheese. Let's just say, it was tricky to hold a conversation in between the yum's and mmm's. Everything was so good!

Before leaving, I was able to chat with one of the employees. He shared with me that during the day, 3 of the storage pods used for dining are open (self-serve) and beginning at 5pm, all 10 open and have wait-staff, and is first come first serve (no reservations). In addition, while dining in the pods, you can also order from Strange Bird as well. The pods are heated, candle-lit and have a protective shield to distance you from your server.

Based on the food, vibe and friendliness of the staff, this is a well-earned 5 stars! A little birdie even told me they have amazing shakes! I can't wait to take my hubby and dine in one of the pods.",2021-01-12 02:43:33,389,1847,

Everything about our visit was underwhelming. The wings took about 35 minutes to come out which is a little nuts in my opinion. And they really need more sauce. I think the wings here would be delicious if they were actually in sauce as opposed to just drizzled for presentation. 
As a side note, I feel everything on the menu is wildly overpriced. $8 for chicken noodle soup is a laugh riot. $19 for a few fried shrimp and fries is also crazy. 
Since our wings took forever to come out I suspect our entrees sat in the back for a little while as they weren't hot when they got to us. Boyfriend's burger was room temp. He said it was tasty but I guess it's hard to mess up a burger. 
I ordered the fried shrimp and chips. I thought the shrimp were pretty good but I prefer a lighter batter. This batter almost tasted like onion flavored funnel cake mix. Way too overpowering. Because it was so heavy I could only eat one. The fries were delicious though. Oh and the highlight of my meal was the French onion soup. Definitely worth the $8 price tag. 
I was hoping King's Corner could be my new spot for bangers and mash or shepherds pie or haggis or Guinness beef stew or literally anything British or Scottish. But it is sadly just an average bar selling average food.",2021-01-27 05:00:19,313,1478,

So, after confirming their hours today I finally made it over to this cozy little spot on the west half of the Indianapolis Art Center. 

The set-up here reminds me somewhat of The Haverstick, another coffee/co-working spot that has re-purposed an area and turned it into a functional spot that also maintains the aura of its host. 

It's noteworthy that the first thing you'll notice as you enter Indianapolis Art Center and the library itself is that it's an incredibly quiet space. While there were several people present when I arrived, people were mostly working to themselves with books and/or laptops and conversation was quite minimal. It was so noticeable that when I started to crinkle the wrapping for my cookie I did so quietly so as not to disturb anyone. 

The Library is a partnership with the fine folks at nearby BRICS (as if you couldn't love them anymore). 30% of the proceeds goes directly back to Indianapolis Art Center. That's pretty awesome. 

The Library offers plenty of parking - it's important to note that right now you do have to use the main entrance. There's accessible parking and curb cuts - plus, they even have automatic doors (push button). However, it's a little bit of a wheel/walk. However, we are living in a pandemic and it's hard to begrudge them crowd control! 

They offer high-speed internet access and the library itself has 30+ electrical outlets (they advertise this - I didn't count them. I was tempted.). They support local including Tinker Coffee, Hubbard & Cravens teas, and 4 Birds Bakery pastries and cookies. 

Prices are consistent with coffee shops. I ordered an iced mocha latte and a peanut butter chip cookie. It was about 8 bucks. I'm usually just a plain old coffee drinker, but decided to live on the edge a bit (this is about as edgy as it gets after the age of 50). 

The ordering counter is right outside the doors to the library. It was rather dark and I initially thought they might be closed, but I think they were probably just preserving utilities or such. The young woman working the counter was friendly and helpful (though very quiet - I think I had to go from 6' apart to 5' apart just to hear her). 

The cookie was delicious and a very nice sized cookie. The iced mocha latte was delicious, though perhaps more foamy than I'd like. By the time the foam subsided, I really only had about half a drink. However, it was tasty. 

Indianapolis Art Center is definitely following guidelines. They have hand-washing stations, arrows on the floor directing you, and regular encouragement to mask up and maintain a social distance. You can check out the art, but they ask that you follow their arrows and have basically made their hallways one way. 

The tables in the library are nicely spaced apart and there were a handful of smaller tables that worked well for someone alone. They had some taller tables that were obviously not accessible, though they had plenty of accessible options. 

The Art Center does have restrooms and I'm pretty sure they have accessible options. I don't visit as often as I should, but it's wonderful in good weather because there's lots of art work on the grounds. 

I'm not sure I'd call this a destination coffee spot, but it's a beautiful space for someone needing to study or just some quiet. The coffee options are solid with espresso, cold brew, craft coffees, signature tea lattes, hot and cold teas, French press, hot chocolate, smoothie options, options for kids, and a handful of snack/pastry type options (plus a ""snack burrito""). Several of their drink options, including mine today, can be made iced or hot. I believe all the prices are in the $3-5 range. 

The Library is offering delivery and curbside options per their website and per their Yelp listing. They're also a great walk-up option if you live in the Broad Ripple area. While i wouldn't drive out of my way to return, I'd definitely return in the area - it's a nice facility, fair prices, friendly service, and your purchase helps a great cause!",2021-01-30 22:50:56,839,4139,

This restaurant has been one of my absolute favorite spots since moving to St. Louis. To honor my love of this little gem of a coffee shop, I'd like to offer a BOGO review for you... so if you're paying attention Mr. Keeper of Ye Old Yelp Stars, this one should count as 10.

REVIEW I.
""A Simpler Time"" Circa Early 2020
*****
MUD HOUSE IS THE BOMB! There are brunch spots around town that have patrons who gloat about the wait always being long as if it were some badge of honor, and then serve up mediocre to below average food (hint: cock-a-doodle-do!) Well here's the sitch. When you go to the Mud House, you're going to have to wait. But it's worth it. I think that part of the reason so many people mention other restaurants' wait times is because the food is not memorable. In stark contrast you have the Mud House, who has so many star offerings that it's hard to mention even just one in a verbose review! People remember how good the food they had while brunching at the Mud House left them feeling! And it's not just the perfectly prepared breakfast sammie they offer or the unique quiche flavors that rotate daily, it's the experience. I love bringing friends and family to the Mud House because of how cozy it feels. Yes it's a small space, but the decor makes you feel like you're in a really well decorated home, gnoshing down some homemade food. 

REVIEW II.
""The To-Go Era"" Circa January 2021
*****
The Mud House clearly has put a lot of thought into their COVID precautions and to-go ordering process. The efforts do not go unnoticed. While they no longer allow you to sit and get work done on the repurposed bowling alley lane tables, there is a tented outdoor space for those brave enough to eat in the cold. 

There is plexy hung around the entire perimeter of where their baristas create latte masterpieces. They are still serving up all their well known menu favorites and delicious pastries. I went in to grab a coffee and bag of beans to make coffee at home, and was so tempted by the blueberry muffins that I had to buy one of those as well.

As expected, their coffee is BOLD. That's one of the things I absolutely love about the Mud House. The coffee packs a punch. The flavor profile is so rich. One bit of criticism though is that the largest available to-go coffee is really small and I was so sad when it was gone! Oh I remember the simpler times when you had a real mug at the Mud House and could get refills of their enchanting elixir. 

I'm just so happy to see one of my favorite restaurants open during the pandemic. It's so important to me to patronize these places so I see them on the other end of this, thriving, and I can once again enjoy it just like pre-pandemic.",2021-01-19 21:48:39,592,2791,
OEzlLHrq3MSutmcq_tuqLQ,bYENop4BuQepBjM1-BI3fA,77I9ewV1_-lcRYXfWHN5hA,4,9,2,9,"One of the things that  I didn't want to give up when I moved out of St. Louis, was my Dierbergs.  I was a regular at the one located in Mackenzie Pointe, which was relatively close to my home. It was less than 5 miles.  
The departments that I favored were;  produce, prepared foods/deli and meats. I am happy to say, I like my new Dierbergs. 

My new Dierbergs isn't as close, it's 16 miles away. However, it is well worth the drive. I hosted Christmas dinner for a small group of cousins and to make my hosting duties easier, I ordered a couple of side dishes from their prepared foods. The glazed baby carrots got rave reviews from my guest. 

Their liquor department is also pretty awesome. I was able to add gin, hard seltzer and craft beer to my already well stocked bar for my holiday guest. They even had a good variety of mixers to fine tune my cocktails. I was able to stock up on; ginger beer, tonic and club soda. 

Shopping here during the pandemic and a holiday season, was safe. They required all customers and staff to wear mask. They sterilize the shopping cart handles between use and they wipe down cash wrap areas in between each customer. 

A bonus of shopping here is the other nearby stores. When I come to Edwardsville, I can have a day of shopping and fulfill my all needs. 

Will I return? - Yes, I'm a fan of Dierbergs. 

When: December 23, 2020
Why: Groceries for the holiday dinner.",2021-01-01 00:07:08,303,1412,

Man of man am I glad that I came to the realization that my favorite dessert is actually cookies, because otherwise, I don't think I would have ventured to this place. I had seen info about the opening of this new location (the first in Indiana). **I should note that it appears they have a location in Colorado about 5 minutes from where I used to live, and I am now very disappointed that I could have experienced this deliciousness years ago.

According to their website, it looks like they change their flavors weekly, offering 6 cookies (two always being chocolate chip and sugar). I had been trying to test these out since they opened, but the website was continually listing them mostly as sold out. I hopped on last night to scope it out again, and it finally said most were available! Immediately purchased a box of 4, in case that availability were to change again. Was able to score the following, in order of my favorites:

Chilled Cookies and Cream Milkshake- the icing on this one is what really sealed the deal. SO creamy and the flavors were spot on

Oatmeal Chocolate Chip- this one surprised me. The oats were not gritty, or any texture I would have expected, and instead the cookie was smooth (if that even makes sense) SO GOOD

Chilled Sugar- This was my husband's favorite, hands down the best sugar cookie I have ever had

Chocolate Chip- I listed this one last, solely because I have had A LOT of chocolate chip cookies in my lifetime, but this one was still very good. It's a staple on their menu for a reason.

I had ordered curbside delivery, and after I indicated I was there, they brought the box out immediately, with two cookies being ""chilled"" and two being warm. I had inquired about the ""Sold out"" status (if that was just online or in-store as well) and they said to just continually check, in case more are in the oven. I was fully prepared to eat all the cookies last night, but decided to save some for later, which I will now be thinking about all day. Highly recommend this experience for anyone looking for a great cookie!",2021-01-27 12:44:26,454,2184,

When you're the one that's standing there, You'll reach the final bell""

First off, a little background on me. I'm a 40 year old professional account rep that enjoys a good dip in the tub once or twice per year, but I really prefer the shower.  I find getting in and out of the tub to be cumbersome, plus you're just kinda sitting in your own filth water...moving on.

If you know me, you know that I love the Popeye's chicken sandwich.  I'm assuming I reviewed it before (https://www.yelp.com/biz/popeyes-louisiana-kitchen-st-louis-4?hrid=NNZynatlOVfjP249P-9gBQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)).  It's legit, and I love it.  I also have a habit of telling most people I cum into contact with (dudes, chicks, co-workers, drug dealers, the clergy, first responders) to try that sandwich.

I recently read a review of KFC's attempt to knock Popeye's off its pedestal as the champ, so I felt I should give it a shot.  This particular KFC has let me down a few times.  It takes too long, plus the chicken quality isn't as good as local options (Porters, Gus's, Etc). That said, KFC is what it is.  Fast food fried chicken.  Much like call girls in Reno, you get what you pay for.

Yesterday was a big sports day with the AFC/NFC champ games blues a 7PM Blues start.  Needless to say, I got my average level of drunk, and didn't eat enough or switch off waters so I'm pretty rough today.  I'd call it a moderate to strong hangover.  I tried to pre-remedy this at midnight by taking a 50mg edible before bed, but that did not help.  Driving to KFC was hard because I'm spaced out.  Zero focus today.

I got up to the drive thru and ordered the sandwich meal, classic style with no pickle.  At this point, the nice young lady asked if I wanted anything else and I froze.  I locked up for about 30 seconds.  I kept telling myself to get something else, just in case the sandwich is trash, or the meal is not enough sugar and carbs to fill the bottomless pit that is my soul. I finally just said ""Ya, I'll take some popcorn chicken"".  She then asked what dipping sauce and I mumbled something that wasn't English.  She just said OK and assumed ranch, which was correct.  Total was $12.87.

I'll complete the food portion of this review as a direct comparison to Popeye's:

Fries - KFC fries are below average.  Not much crunch to them and they were too thick of a fry for my taste.  I'll be nice and give them a C-.  Popeyes is clearly better

Sandwich - The KFC chicken sandwich isn't bad.  SOLID B on this one.  In no way is it as good as Popeye's chicken sandwich.  It's good, but if you look me in the eye and tell me you prefer the KFC sandwich, you are either lying to yourself or you are just a moron.  They failed to remove the pickle, but that's a simple mistake (or they didn't hear me say ""no pickle"" or I just flat out forgot to say it because I'm dippy AF today).

Popcorn Chicken Nugs - Really above average.  I don't think Popeyes has nugs, so good on you, KFC.  That's a slam dunk win for you.  They were also somewhat necessary to order because I chucked most of the fries and was still craving more empty calories to add to my ever-growing FUPA.

In summation, I ended the meal with a weird taste in my mouth that reminds me of when you lick a 5 volt battery.  It's strange.  KFC is fine. Go there or don't.  Either way I will continue to love and support all of your food choices",2021-01-25 18:35:19,771,3493,

Pad See Ew: Really really good! I got this with tofu & veggies, and requested no egg. The tofu was cooked perfectly. I loved the wide flat noodles and the savory soy sauce. I didn't love the massive carrots so I'll ask for those to be left out next time. I will definitely be ordering this again! It's also big enough to be 2 meals. 

Drunken Noodles: Delicious drunken noodles with the right chili flavor. They use the wide flat noodles which I love. I got this with a spice level 3/5 and it was definitely hot!! I think a 2 would be perfect next time. 

Spring Rolls: YUM! Crunchy, filled with veggies, with a side of sweet chili sauce. These are really big but I could easy eat them all by myself haha.

Golden Triangle: This is fried crispy bean curd which is basically tofu. The breading was awesome and super crunchy, and the peanut sauce that came with it definitely made it. I would get these again!

Corn Cakes: One of the crowd favorites! They were crispy and chewy at the same time, and a little sweet and savory. I always have a hard time sharing these. 

Tofu Satay: I've never had tofu statay before but was slightly disappointed with these, though I'm not really sure what I expected. These didn't have much flavor but the peanut sauce saved the day. Not sure I would get these again.

Vegetarian Dumplings: Not what we expected. These were filled with a bunch of veggies and served with a dark soy sauce. They were just okay, not sure they were worth it. I would rather have fried gyoza type dumplings.

Massaman Curry: 10/10!!!!!!! I think this is the best curry I've ever had in my LIFE. It's similar to Penang but is extra peanutty with actual peanuts & cashews in it, which adds a nice little crunch. The flavor is absolutely fantastic, there are a ton of veggies, and is so creamy. It's not spicy, so next time I'd request a 1 or 2 spice level. I would highly recommend this dish!!! Order with tofu & veg. It's also huge so it's easily 2 meals.

Green Curry: A classic green curry! It's listed as their spiciest curry but I would still request them to turn up the heat next time (maybe try a 3/5). The flavor is awesome and there are a ton of veggies & tofu. This is easily 2 meals.",2021-01-20 17:48:15,539,2382,

I made an appointment for my 85 year old mother a week ago at the North Tampa office for a hearing assessment.  At the time I made the appointment, I gave the scheduler my mom's Medicare and secondary insurance carrier numbers. 

 We were advised to arrive early to fill out paperwork.  To save time, I downloaded the new patient forms ahead of time and filled them out with my mom.  We arrived 15 minutes before the appointment time.  Rather than ask for all the necessary information when she checked in, they called her up to the window four times asking for various things.  This created a clog up with other patients at the window.  Not good, especially in COVID time.  Also, my mom is using a walker and had a hard time going back and forth so many times.  

About 45 minutes into our wait, the person at the window asked us to come up again and informed us that my mom's secondary insurance info was not entered properly at the time the appointment was made.  She was having trouble verifying the insurance.  I asked to go ahead with processing her and we would pay any co-pays or $ not covered.  After another 15 minutes of waiting, we were called yet again to the window and she informed us that my mom would have to reschedule her appointment!!! The audiologist was behind and couldn't see her because of the wait.  The wait that was created by this office and their incompetence.  This is unacceptable!!! We will not be rescheduling and will find another audiologist. 

This practice is obviously a big operation with lots of doctors and audiologists.  They might be fine as practitioners, but we will never know.  STAY AWAY from this group if you want to go somewhere where your time is valued as much as theirs!!!",2021-01-26 19:16:05,368,1843,

My wife and I wanted to treat our oldest grandson to dinner and this was fairly close to his apartment.  Since it was new and getting lots of great reviews, I combined my love of good food with the opportunity to spend time with my eldest.  

The place still needs some work on the interior, (concrete floors need a good cleaning), but the kitchen appeared bright and clean, all the staff had masks worn appropriately.  They have the menus that you can pull up on your phones if you have the right app, and even though they didn't have any outdoor seating for the cold weather, the tables were spaced far enough apart that we felt comfortable dining in.

This is Texas style BBQ and they offer a variety of meats including ribs, pork shoulder, chicken, and brisket.  They also offer a couple varieties of chili including the Hillbilly Chili that my wife selected.  It has a Trinity of meats including pork, brisket, and sausage served over fritos along with jalapenos, sour cream, pickled onions, etc.  She thought it spicy, but not too strong.

I don't know if they have any vegan or vegetarian options, frankly because I didn't look.  I was there for BBQ!

I ordered the pulled pork shoulder which had an excellent taste.  They have multiple sauces available.  I went with their mustard, pickles, and onion on my sandwich and it was delicious!  The only negative I had was that the buns felt a little greasy to the touch (you can see the shine in the photos).  Not sure what caused that.

Note that all the sandwiches are ala carte, so it can get expensive if you start ordering sides and a full size sandwich.  Most sandwiches offer a choice of full pound or half pound servings.  They also have some family size meals or shareables, but these still can get a bit pricey if you aren't used to going out to nicer fully smoked BBQ houses.

To my knowledge, they do not have a liquor license, so I believe most of the beverages are sodas or bottled waters.  This place would be fantastic if they could get the right to serve craft beers with their BBQ!  

My grandson got the mac and cheese and my wife was able to get a bite and said it was delightful.  I ordered the baked beans as a side and they were fantastic!  Lots of brown sugar, and a bit of brisket in with the beans made it almost a meal in itself.  Lots of layers of flavors and all worked well together.  Highly recommend them!

The staff were friendly and waited us at the table.  We were provided napkins and plastic ware so we didn't need to wander around looking for any of that.

I look forward to visiting them again and hope to try the ribs.  If they are anywhere as tasty as the sandwiches and chili, it will be well worth the trip.

Being Sicilian, married a Sicilian, and have spent my life eating incredible Italian foods. BUT! Ulele and Columbia are some of my favorite restaurants. My family (trujillos) and in-laws (Noriega's and Provenzano's) think very highly of gonzmart and his brand and go back for many many decades. 

Restaurant ambiance- A+++ 
Drinks/special cocktail menu- Solid B. 
Portions- A++
Apps- A
Main meal- C
Dessert- D 
Service- D. 

Pros- 
*literally one of the most beautiful restaurants in Tampa. The decor was gorgeous and spot on, and made me feel comfortable and content, as if I was in a very fancy version of my mother's kitchen. 

*extremely nice and polite staff. 

*housemade scachatta is on point. herbs that went with the bread are too... thought I might've been more satisfied with a smaller, more dense baguette type of Italian bread. 

*portions are huge!!!! I couldn't finish even half of my dinner. 

*SO much LOBSTER on my plate! Huge plus. (Lobster linguini) 

Cons- (note- I honestly think they were having a rough night, and have some kinks to work out. We WILL absolutely be back. Just wanted to give an honest account for feedback) 

*our reservation was at 8:15. We arrived on time. We got sat at 9. 

* had to flag down a waiter to order drinks, then apps, then meals, then desserts. Our water glasses were never filled once and we were never offered another cocktail, and never really had the chance to ask for one. Was also told they didn't sell crown, 10 mins after finishing a crown and ginger upstairs ‍

*cannoli shells were burnt. Filling was gritty and lacked the traditional ricotta flavor that makes a cannoli a cannoli with an over abundance of confectioners sugar. We fly in our canolli shells and ricotta at Christmas time for our family cannolis, so I might be a brat when it comes to cannolis. 

*red sauce is acidic and lacks complexity, because of this. They're def made from fresh stewed tomatoes (big plus) but they're too acidic to allow for any other flavors to be prevalent. They either need to add in whole carrots to allow the starch to soak up the acidic taste and naturally sweeten, or they need to cook down the tomatos a bit more and get more generous with sugar. 

*the meat in My husbands meal was extremely overcooked and unpleasant. Been there.... it's from stewing in the sauce for too long. The sauce poached egg (our fav treat to do at home) was so overcooked, it was gray. ( he got the Spaghetti with egg, pork, sausage, and meatball)

*antipasto was mediocre. But any antipasto is better than no antipasto, so.. not really complaining. The cheeses were great. 

*gosh, service was horrid.  server was so nice, but.... we were so thirsty 

*my husband compared it to Olive Garden . I'll go back in a few months to try again, we really truly think we just had some bad luck, and maybe it was an off evening. We will def return to try again, and we still had a good time. I love that the there is a nod to Sicilian culture again in ybor! We appreciate that, and will eagerly come back to try again!

**edited to add- please serve long noodle pastas with a spoon. It's hard to eat pasta respectfully in public without one. I like to leave the slurping and stained shirt for home",2021-01-10 17:43:23,708,3340,

During Christmas I didn't join my family but they commented that the staff was rude. I was really surprised. They have always been so helpful and cool before. The owner has always been awesome. Today I go in to get a product and inquire about some juice. The girl that waited on me acted like she couldn't be bothered from the first second. Every question I asked she rolled her eyes and acted put out. I bought the device but opted not to buy any juice. I'll get it elsewhere. She was so rude that I almost didn't buy the product either. If I wasn't going out of town tomorrow I would have driven 2 miles down the road to another vape shop. In addition, the last 2 times I have been there none of the staff are wearing masks at any time. Maybe a different owner but it has definitely changed for the worse and that is a real shame. I won't be recommending it to anyone again as I have  in the past.
Steve, thanks for your reply! I really always have been impressed with Drip. My partner, Kim and I met you about 2 years ago when we first moved to the neighborhood. We don't get there as often as we like as we are caregivers to a family member. I really respect how you run the place and all your employees have been amazing... until today, unfortunately. I don't review often (I should review positive experiences much more often). This afternoon (1/9/21 ~ 4:30pm) was so different it was disappointing.

We were in the area for Hobby Lobby and figured we should have lunch at Blaze since it was right there. Thing is, we are cutting carbs and pizza is not typically synonymous with healthy. 

Luckily! Blaze offers some alternative crusts, one being a Keto crust. It's made with flaxseed, eggs and cheese. With the right toppings, we could have ourselves a lower carb pizza that we felt good about. Also, we usually each get our own but today we split a pizza. We also always split the Caesar salad.

This particular afternoon, Blaze wasn't too busy, no line and plenty of seating. We walked up and ordered our pizza with the Keto crust. It appears to be smaller than their regular crust but I could be wrong. We went down the line and topped it with deliciousness. The whole process was quick, easy and friendly. We each had a free drink reward so we ordered the pizza and salad separately. The Keto crust is an extra $3.95.

Our pizza was up quick. The crust was definitely different. The texture and consistency was odd at first. It was mushy or soggy on the inside but crispy and flavorful from the brick oven char on the outside. That being said, we would easily order a keto crust again from here. It didn't ruin the pizza or make it any less enjoyable. Just healthier in our opinion.

We always enjoy our visits to Blaze Pizza. We use the app for rewards now and again and it's nice to know they have healthy minded alternatives.",2021-01-05 17:25:33,312,1487,

Drinks were awesome, we tried several: silent fizz (light, tart, only a little egg white foam which I liked because the thick ones taste funky to me), Marias (complex sweet and full bodied yet not overwhelming-their take on a Japanese margarita I think they said), blind River (light, not too sweet), and Carter noir (kind of like an espresso martini). All great-you really can't go wrong with any of their cocktail selections. I think our favorite was the Marias though.

We also got several small plates and shared around the table: 
- Onion soup (holy moly, definitely the best onion soup I've ever had-so rich, lots of onions, super thick cheese layer)
-Lobster bisque (tasty but definitely on the fishier side so would err away if you're not super into seafood, and also a little small on the portion size without much actual lobster but it was super rich)
-Steak tartare (big portion of beef fixed up and came with little toasted baguettes-we were offered extra ones which, had we known prior to eating, would have taken advantage of because it comes with so much meat!)
-Country fried garden oysters (actually fried escargot! We didn't realize but the waitress let us know-we still wanted to try and they were crispy deliciousness that came with both Buffalo sauce and ranch for dipping)
-Blue crab remoulade blanc (very light with lots of shredded veggies atop butter lettuce, not a whole lot of crab in there)
-Pan roasted gulf shrimp (huge shrimp in a bowl of ginger garlic chili butter sauce and bread for dipping-wow, so flavorful-could have drank that sauce!)

Overall, we had an amazing evening here and will definitely be back for date night or with friends in the future!!

In Short: The Sambuca Nashville GM (Jonathan) treated me with my guests in a condescending and dismissive way by repeatedly throwing cost in my face, throwing the contract at my head and throwing both his 30 years of experience and 6 years with his staff to try to imply that I was an uneducated, low worth none customer that had no right to a concern of the dinner that was selected paid for. He tried to treat me like I was not valued as a person or customer. And never treated me like a professional  hospitality service leader.    

My wedding was ruined by a bitter Sambuca GM repeatedly insulting and treating me and my guest like our presence at the restaurant was a privilege to us. The issue was not the staff or the food but the General Manager (JB or Johnathan). This person treated me like I was a classless idiot and a burdensome person on the street to him and not a patron that brought 25-30 of my friends and new family to eat.  He treated me like I was a liar and then insulted me by repeatedly implying that I didn't have the money or the knowhow of eating at restaurant like Sambuca so I should feel privileged that was able to be in the space the offered and we paid for. 

On December 30, 2020  I had my wedding rehearsal dinner booked at Sambuca Nashville which was secured 3 months ago. I chose a menu and appetizers only and asked not to add any alcohol or open bar automatically for specific reason.  When I arrived I saw that guests were offered a preselected and poured wine that I wasn't aware of, that no guest asked for or ordered themselves and with no ones ID checked. I told the staff this was wrong, asked how this happened and asked they stop serving  those drinks and wanted an explanation for the open bar addition and a resolution of the drinks that were handed out.  It looked to me like the pre poured wine was added to try to meet or exceed the minimums and/or things were added to the dinner that I never selected or even asked about. 

The server agreed to stop serving the pre selected wine and suggested I talk to the General Manger to get it my concerns addressed, but what happened next was the GM came out with dismissive attitude and said that I was wrong, that his sales manager never makes mistakes in the 6 years his as worked with her, that my views on restaurant service were ignorant compared to his 30 years of experience, tossing the rolled up contract at me and worst of all that I and my family/friends were done a favor by being allowed to sit in a place that we paid for but sambuca suggested. I repeated tried to move to resolution but he just wanted to argue a point and express how little I knew or deserved. After almost 30-40 minutes past our dinner time start the GM tried to tell me to move on without any solution after being treated like I was eating a meal graciously donated.  For my guests I left the restaurant to try to let them enjoy the rest night and when I returned later I could not even eat much of what was left because I felt disrespected. 

I felt the GM looked and spoke to me with my guests in a condescending and dismissive way from the start or had something to prove that night where he decided to pick this customer satisfaction issue to show utmost frustration or disrespect. I don't know if it was because of how I looked, if he had a bad night, if the pressures of COVID just hit him. But he choose an altercation to let some frustrations out. 

The servers and bar staff were good outside of acting like they didn't know who the GM was when I asked to make a complaint. I can't say much about the food because I was so embarrassed and outraged that I didn't get to eat much of anything I picked out for my guests. 
This was never about money. It was about following my requests and disrespect. I chose a dinner for my family and friends and what I requested was not what I got and It looked to me that things served to guest that neither they nor I requested to meet your minimum.  

As the general manager,  my expectation was that he would acknowledge that as a customer I felt something was wrong and upsetting, understand there was a mistake made somewhere and quickly move to a resolution despite our disagreement. Instead I felt like I was talking to someone in a car wreck on the street debating who had the right of way. I was challenged, embarrassed, insulted, told that in his staff never makes mistakes, that my concerns were impossible and intelligent repeatedly, that his 30 years of experience meant that my concerns were not valid and worst of all it was repeatedly implied that it was the privilege or we were given special circumstances to reserve that room for the night because its reserved for those that pay $3,000 or $5,000. All I asked for when booking was the cost and I would pay it. I was upset and caused undo stress in an otherwise as happy experience",2021-01-05 04:36:12,988,4982,

If so, you may be like so many people wanting to send them a beautiful bouquet of flowers to cheer them up or let them know you're thinking about them. Well in my opinion, don't use this place for your bouquet. I can't speak to the events, but I certainly can speak to the flowers. 

It all began when I was heading out to go to the hospital to do a ""window visit"" with my loved one, When my doorbell rang. Oh not once, but multiple times like somebody was having a major emergency. (Granted I'm already in an anxious state of mind and heart); when suddenly someone is banging --frantically mind you -- on my door. So now I'm really freaked out running to the door all the way from the back bathroom. 

I opened the door unsure of what was happening, only to see the backside of a lady running back to her car saying: I didn't want the flowers to sit outside. No. She didn't hand them to me gently and graciously. She never thought about the fact that I'm about to possibly lose somebody in my life that I dearly love. Instead she scared me to death and ran off and left me flowers that are half dead already. 

I took photos later when I got home of the flowers that were already beginning to brown and turn wilted. I called the shop and explained it to the owner. She replied: oh well I can't send anybody out today it's way too late! But I will have somebody call you before noon tomorrow. Lest I say, that never happened now it's day two and all of the greens that came with the bouquet are totally wilted and hanging down lifeless. I even checked to make sure there's enough water and realized this is the first time I've gotten a bouquet with that one of those little ""food "" packets. I called again but nobody answers the phone. I don't really have time to deal with this but I would certainly never bring these to the hospital. What is more, I will certainly not tell the caring friends that sent this bouquet and probably spent a good penny.",2021-01-08 15:36:21,449,2067,

We ate at the Wesley chapel location on 12/28/2020, a location we frequent fairly often. We generally have an enjoyable experience, but this last time has turned us off from wanting to return. For starters, our server, while very nice, was clearly brand new and very untrained. With a chain restaurant, you would think there'd be consistency in their training protocols, but that is clearly not the case here. Every time we asked a question, he had to walk away for 1-2 minutes to ask someone. In particular, we asked about their stone crabs, and it took him several minutes to figure out how many come in an order and how much they cost. We then ordered the medium order, of which he came back a few minutes later to tell us they ""ran out"" of that size. That's fine, except they refused to accommodate our request of fewer crabs in the large order for the price of the medium order, as we did not want to spend $44 on something we had never tried and weren't sure we'd like. We subsequently ordered the large order, but upon arrival we could tell something was not right. Cracking into the first one, a huge amount of pink slime squirted out all over everything, rendering the dish and sides completely inedible, as we were obviously very grossed out. We weren't going to say anything about this, but upon cracking into our snow crabs, we could immediately tell that those were definitely not fresh. Every time I put the fork into them, pieces of crab meat flaked everywhere, making it impossible to eat and they looked like the stringy, artificial crab you get at cheap sushi places. As this could not be ignored, we discussed this with the waiter who again, was very nice, offered to bring us something else, but we declined. The manager came over, was also nice, and took off the price of the more-expensive stone crabs as compensation, which we appreciated. At the end of the ordeal we asked for the check, and upon its arrival our waiter asked if we would like 2 drinks in to-go cups. We assumed these were courtesy drinks for our poor experience, so we happily accepted. However, we then received a new bill from the waiter with $20 added for the drinks. We were obviously surprised and a bit perturbed, but worse was that 10 minutes after paying the new bill and waiting for the drinks we still didn't get them. I approached the waiter and asked that he just refund the price of the drinks, as we did not feel like waiting any longer for them and just wanted to leave, and again was met with ""I have to look into that."" A few minutes later another waitress brought the 2 drinks over and we did not see the waiter or manager again, so we just paid for all of that dissatisfaction and left. While we were disappointed in our food, we feel more badly for the fact that our waiter was clearly overwhelmed and untrained, and a corporation like this should not be throwing new employees to the wolves like that.",2021-01-01 20:51:05,617,2981,

This was one of the few bars that was still open and were we ever so thankful. 

There weren't that many people in this little bar but that was fine with us since that meant we would have a place to sit. Normally this place is popping with loud music, a line out front and people having a great time. Not this time. There were a few party people in there but only because one lady was celebrating her birthday and had to be the life of the party. There were only there for about an hour or so. 

We were a party of four ladies so it wasn't hard to find a spot to park. Once we sat down (by the way, the tables are clearly marked which ones were dirty and which ones were sanitized), we were greeted almost instantly. I can't remember our hostess' name but she was pretty and she happened to be the bartender as well...double duty. There were only 3 workers working at the time so you can imagine that things weren't as fast as they are normally are during their busy times. It was fine with us. We weren't in a hurry. There were two lady bartenders and one bar back. All three worked together well to greet their customers, grab orders, clean tables, clean dishes, make orders and still have smiles on their faces like they enjoyed their job. Our hostess even chatted with us a bit. 

We all order margaritas  on the rocks which were delicious. They were different than the normal watered down or heavily poured alcohol flooded margaritas I've normally had. This one tasted amazing. We tried to figure our her ""secret"" and we were on the money after a couple of guesses. We found out it was her signature drink so she always made it special. She said she practiced it and practiced it to make it perfect. I think she did an amazing job. We loved our drinks so much we ordered four more rounds. Near closing time you can imagine how things were looking on our end...a little on the tipsy side. Those drinks are sneakers...delicious, refreshing but little creapers.

Great bourbon selection but surprised no ice sphere or big cubes, not a deal breaker by any means but small cubes melt too quickly - maybe just a personal bourbon issue. Pour size was average.  Had the crew I was with drinking Eagle Rare as its not crazy expensive but difficult to find a bottle at the favorite candy store.  Cant miss with that.  Atmosphere was very chill and laid back.  Certainly not a pretentious place as the clientele varied as much as the surrounding neighborhood. We shared a charcuterie board and shrimp & grits.  Both very good but not earth shattering.  They need to do some work on the andouille recipe that was on the C board.  I didn't get the bacon fat candle concept with the C board but whatever, maybe I didn't pay attention to the description.  Ordered a strip that was cooked to perfection, had a great taste and was top notch.  Had bearnaise on the side and my personal preference is for it to be thick and not liquidy as water. Cant complain about personal preferences.  The garlic mashed potatoes that went with the strip were dead on arrival - obviously the taters were ready and waiting for the strip to finish.

F_-X4B6EA1A8GfGUB6svag,17h8CPqEcXolWiTtebMMhQ,Io0Hue4dVurqoV1jCCrNeA,5,0,0,0,"My experience with BT Reno began in 2016. I was in the planning phase of starting my own transport company.  If this is as far as you read, let me say that they have been critical in the huge success of Gold Anchor Transport Service (GAT)!! This is somewhat lengthy as I am going to give a full account of all the ways they have helped us be successful. If you are still reading, here is a few reasons why. 1)  No pressure sales technique.  Miguel was my salesman when I came in looking for a particular trailer (20AC51 model car hauler). I had my financing all set and spoke with Miguel about the model I was after.  He didn't try to sell me up or down but focused right on my needs, answered questions and I felt very at ease with him right away. If you've spent more than 10 minutes at any dealership, you know the feeling of being circled and checked out from a distance like you were a baitfish being sized up by sharks.  Not here. 2) Easy financing. I thought I had my financing all locked up but when it came time to sign, my lender had question after question and requested thing after thing which Miguel kept quietly providing with no complaint. After like 45 minutes of back and forth with my lender, Miguel suggested to me that something was wrong with this lender as he had never seen so many things required and just them being so generally difficult. He suggested I call one of there's and introduced me to Sheffield Financial. I was literally out of there with GATS first trailer in 10 minutes. My old lender was fired!!  3) After sale support. After a few loads getting used to my new trailer I discovered some things I didn't like and went back in to see if there was anything they could do. Again Miguel said yes I had several options. First of which was to ditch the gooseneck hitch and go with a king pin tube that allows you to connect to a fifth wheel hitch installed in your truck bed. Waaaay more secure and stable and should be the standard connection on that type trailer in my opinion. Also I had constant grinding on the tail end on certain surfaces which is the nature of the beast with that type trailer. Miguel said they could weld on skid wheels like you see on some motor homes to prevent bottom damage. I was honestly pissed at him for not telling me this up front but he said some guys don't mind the grinding and he didn't want me to think he was just trying to upsell me on some BS upgrade. RESPECT but in this case I wish he would have. 4) Service. They have a great service department which I use exclusively for my maintenance and repair issues. Since my initial purchase of the AC, I have since gone to them for my 22GN and tried to buy yet another trailer from them as my business has exploded. Unfortunately I have the heaviest model BT makes so I had to switch brands BUT I still take my non BT models to them and have never had to stop because a repair they did came undone. 5) Tech support. I had an electrical component on my NON BT MODEL trailer came apart, literally.  I tried calling that manufacturer for help and was told I had to bring the trailer in to any of there facilities but I literally could not move the trailer for safety reasons. NO HELP. Basically I was told that unless I could figure out a way to get there I was SOL. I called BT in Reno from Texas which is where I was broke down. They had me simply text a picture of the damage and Lorren (the service guy at the time) said do this, this and that. I did what he said and was back on the road in 20 minutes. Never received a bill for the service call. 6) Referrals. BT Reno had to suspend their service department due to covid or corporate layoffs or who knows what but I do know that Miguel did not stop because of that. As a hard running business I still had needs and he was my go to guy now. I called saying I needed this or that and he simply said in his casual way that unfortunately they could not satisfy my need at this time BUT to call so and so and whatever place and that they could address my issue. Again, RESPECT.  He never tried to cover anything up or hoard my business by scheduling me way in the future whenever their service department was back up and running.  As a retired Navy Chief, we live by the code of no excuses.  Don't come with problems, come with solutions.  Miguel has solutions! Every place he referred me did exceptional work but I still give BT Reno first crack. Ron is on staff as the maintenance guy now and superbly took the torch from Lorren. I had another horrible issue come up and Miguel said come in.  Ron had all my woes fixed in less than an hour.  7)  Network.  BT Reno was one of our first customers. He has asked me to go as far as Texas to pick up a trailer that a customer wanted and deliver it TO THEIR HOUSE in NorCal! If you want it, he can find it. Don't let the empty lot fool you! And Jesus. He handles all trailers I deliver with finesse and pride. Never so much as a knick with his forklift.  Impressive!",2021-01-30 20:20:40,1055,4981,

So, when I was meeting up for northside friends for lunch, I thought it would be fun to go to Mimi Blue in the Keystone Mall. We got there at noon. There was one guy eating solo and a couple other tables occupied. We ordered baked goat cheese peperonata for $10. While we waited for that, it was fun to check off what meatballs we wanted to get on the paper menu with the provided pencils. I picked out four meatballs for $13. One friend ordered two meat balls and an $8 salad. Another picked the meatball salad $15 and a side of  linguine. We turned our orders in to the waiter who was great at answering all our questions. The appetizer came but it was COLD. It could have been so good but the flavors were a huge miss. Our food came. Linguine had to be sent back because it was cold. The meatballs were just lukewarm. Then-it happened. My friend found a distinct dark hair about a good inch long nestled on her plate up against a meatball. She literally almost got sick and so did the poor waiter when we called him over and showed it to him. He whisked it away and then nothing - we just sat there for several minutes. No one had the stomach to eat the rest of their food and we had just started our meal. Finally we asked another waitress if we could speak to the manager. He came up to the table with an ""attitude""- (I am not making this up or exaggerating). He didn't say he was sorry but that he did know about it. He said, ""We all have short hair back there."" He said he wouldn't charge for that dish. We told him none of us could eat our meal, everything was cold and what we wanted to do was tip the waiter and just leave. So we did. Such a sorry experience!",2021-01-13 12:48:41,392,1762,

The first guy when I called I was asking about a specific tire and he said yeah we should have that, and I asked if they did any kind of discounts for first responders or vets and he said yeah I think so but didn't know the discount, I then asked if I can make an appointment for Saturday and he said that they don't take appointments just to come in whenever. When I call back the second time the guy said none of that was true whatsoever the tires I actually wanted I had to have them special order. And appointment was not necessary but helpful so I wouldn't have to wait. The second person was able to provide me with a price quote reflective to what I found on their website. When I call to confirm my appointment they didn't seem to know anything about a timeframe that I was supposed to come in. When I did actually arrive the price was different than what was quoted. The manager did adjust it to as close as he could get as what was discussed on the phone. And honestly I didn't have a complete breakdown so I couldn't guarantee what the cost was so  he did his best to make it work for me. Two tires and an alignment I was told would take about an hour and a half over two hours later my car was ready. By that time I was very tired and overly frustrated -  it had been a very long day for me.  When I spoke to the mgr about the multiple phone calls- He had explained to me that sometimes the shop guys answer the phones and they don't have all the answers and then he said sometimes the corporate picks up which in my case was the second phone call. I explain to him that if the shop guys don't know what they're talking about they shouldn't be answering the phone because all it does is add frustration for customers so much they I almost didn't buy from them. He apologized and of course was very kind.",2021-01-08 00:57:46,413,1964,

I was an in-patient at Saunders House for nearly 3 months while rehabbing my legs.  And, I must say, their Rehab personnel are outstanding. On a scale of 1 to 5, their Rehab is a solid 5 star.  They take their work seriously, care about working one on one to help achieve measurable results.  I can't say enough about their OT and PT personnel that worked with me 5 - 6 days a week. Their Rehab personnel are not employed by Saunders House.  They are employed by an outside agency, which is why I believe their program is so awesome.

Most of the other personnel at Saunders House, including Nursing, Nursing Management, Nursing Assistants are all disgusting.  They all have attitude, lack people skills, lazy and annoyed.  There are a few individuals that stand out as good caring people, but the vast majority are horrible.  Asking for fresh water takes anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes, if they remember, at all.  And the annoyed look on their face, tells it all.  They don't want to be here, they don't want to serve and all they care about is a pay check. Nursing management, exhibit attitude, as well. Personnel on the 3-11pm shift are, without a doubt, the worst.

On several occasions, my evening medications were not available. Reason? They ran out and decided to reorder.  Any competent organization would have checks and balances in place to insure medications are re-ordered well in advance.  But, not Saunders House.  Their MO is when the medication runs out, reorder it.  On those occasions where my medications were not available, the only response I get from  the Nurse is a shrug of the shoulders with an attitude like, it's on order, period.

Towels and linens are in short supply.    Asking an Assistant to make my bed usually becomes an uphill battle.

Food service at Saunders House is poor.  The quality of the food is, for the most part, terrible.  Soups are watered down with loads and loads of salt.  Breakfast omelets are usually burnt.   They usually forget to deliver part of the order.  Calling down to Food Service, sometimes is impossible to get through and when someone does answer, they're usually annoyed that you're even calling. 

Upper management visited  my room on 2 separate occasions to get my feedback about my overall experiences.  The individual left her card and told me to reach out to her with any issues.  Later, during my stay, I started to have issues and when I telephoned her, of course, she just blew me off by nevere returning my call.  Typical MO at Saunders.

I could go on and on with various other issues, but venting my frustration would not serve me any good.  It is what it is.  Does upper management care?  Probably, but is in no position to carry out the rampant attitude and incompetence that wreaks throughout the facility.

Infrastructure at Saunders House is fractured. I would not recommend this facility for anyone looking for in-patient rehabilitation. Their attitude and incompetence just doesn't cut it for me.",2021-01-11 00:08:58,619,3102,

My husband and I are well-experienced-not-so-young-eaters and ""well seasoned"" home cooks with a focus on local sourcing of quality products and one of our happiest food discoveries in 2020 was a remarkably delicious and professionally assembled Boise Bite meal kit offered through one of our favorite wineries, Telaya, as part of the winery's Friday Night Bites series.  We expected the Boise Bite meal to be good given Telaya does everything with excellence as North Star and select food purveyor partners for events who do the same.  But this meal exceeded our high expectations.  

BOISE BITE MEAL KITS @ TELAYA FRIDAYS:  The menu changes each time and is published at Boise Bites web page, FB page and Insta.  Order in advance and there is pandemic-safe pick up at Telaya;s easy to access parking lot on that Friday beginning at 3pm.  The meal may require a small amount of cooking but it is simple stuff, directions are provided and all is professionally packaged to make using at home a breeze.  Sized to serve 2 people, meal portions are ample and we had extras to repurpose for a meal the next day too.  Price is $100 and includes a bottle of Telaya's excellent wine from of your choice from any in current release.  Our recent meal kit included the following and paired beautifully with Telaya Wahluke Chardonnay:

*Kale salad w/ marinated tomatoes & brioche croutons & Caesar dressing (one of the best of all time)
*Succulent 8 oz bone in pork loin chops w/mustard herb bread crumbs
*Perfectly seasoned farro in risotto style with mushrooms & pecorino
*S'more's chocolate pudding trifle

Note: these Friday meal kits sell out so order early with that in mind. https://boisebite.com/telaya-meal-kits 

EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED TO EVERYTHING ELSE:  Were it not for Boise Bite being used by Telaya for the Friday Night Bites take away events, we would likely not  have discovered them because they are identified as food truck and in the main we aren't food truck fans.  But having been introduced to their food, we will both buy Boise Bite meal kits again if they continue this in 2021 and seek out the truck.  If truck fare is anything like the meal kits then this is top quality eats on wheels.  As high praise meant at first blush, I put Boise Bite possibility in the same class as Wild Plum for catering and if they were brick and mortar they might have potential land with top notch eateries like Madre Boutique Taqueria or Modern Bar & Restaurant for creativity and quality.  And in all of those businesses, as in Boise Bite, pride of ownership shines.

NOT ALL WHO WANDER ARE LOST:   Zach's bio says:  ""A love for the west and a sense of adventure now brings Zach to the Boise area to build something new.  He is excited to share his passion for food and wine in the Treasure Valley with the new Boise Bite food truck and continue catering for both social and corporate events.""  I'd say the Treasure Valley is fortunate to have them land here. 

YOUNG OWNERS WITH CRED:  The owners published bio on their web page so I'll let them 'speak for themselves' through linking the information below.  But the thumbnail is Zach was involved in cooking since childhood and followed has passion to culinary school in Chicago and a wine program in Napa to become Chef and Somm before working with another partner and Julia to start a respected catering and events business, Brix, in Chicago.  Julia, who has an International Business degree, had a passion for planning parties and then events  and moved into that professionally from political fundraisers to planning large scale corporate events for Marriott and then running the catering division for an artisan food purveyor in Chicago while working with Zach to create and manage Brix.

HOW TO FIND THE TRUCK & WHAT'S ON THE MENU:  In my humble experience, many food trucks do a poor job of keeping their web sites and FB pages current to be able to know where they are when and what's on the menu.   Boise Bite does a good job of both and an even better job via Insta (as is true for most trucks it seems).  https://boisebite.com  Given I am a non fan of Insta (I can't figure out the appeal) I appreciate timely updates via their FB page and detail info via web site.  Such as list of truck menu items for the season...although of course not all things on all days.  Offerings like sweet potato tacos, farro risotto (don't miss this) , santa fe wings, lobster mac n cheese and Fall bite burger in $10 - $18 range.  https://boisebite.com/food-truck-menu",2021-01-04 21:17:04,918,4811,

This was the spot to pick up our swag bags for this week's first-ever Yelpies celebrating the best and brightest and weirdest of Indy's Yelpers (Okay, I added ""weirdest""). We were instructed to either have our ID or our Yelp page available. As is always true on Mass Avenue, parking is metered unless it's Sunday (then it's free!) or a holiday. I found an accessible spot over by Rooster's (I love that place!) and then wheeled up the sidewalk and into the store that had a two-sided glass door. Masks were required and social distancing enforced. They were limiting capacity (I believe it was six at one time). When I was there, only one other customer was present (a Yelper!) and one was leaving (another Yelper!). 

Since someone was in front of me, I checked out all the goods. They have that awesome Frittle and, of course, the best chocolate in town. It's not just a name - it's a fact! I wasn't going to get much because I knew I was headed over to check out The Garage Food Hall, but my Saturday was a ""support local"" Saturday. 

The young woman working the counter, whose name I didn't get, was super-duper friendly and way organized. She knew about the event, had the list ready, and checked my ID. She grabbed my swag bag and provided me with my milk chocolate truffle (Thanks Yelp!). 

Here's the best part - While customer service isn't necessarily uncommon, disability awareness really is kind of uncommon. Transitioning that over to actual disability comfort? It's practically unheard of (kind of like me ending a sentence with a preposition). 

This young woman, without missing a beat, walked around the counter and was going to put the bag on my wheelchair. She clearly understood how I'm mobile and how I carry things. She saw that I had a backpack and offered to put it in the backpack for me and to zip the backpack back up. 

This is such a simple gesture - but, quite honestly, I was blown away by it. It's a level of comfort and service I almost never get. I honestly wanted to start her a fan club right then and there. 

I didn't, but I wanted to! 

Seriously, the options here are awesome, the prices are reasonable, the service is outstanding, and it's all local! This level of customer service was so extraordinary that I practically want to shout it to the rooftops. 

Instead, I'll simply write this review and say ""Thank you!""",2021-01-18 00:18:36,564,2619,

The parking lot is completely packed each evening. Even during off hours it was crowded. I felt completely uncomfortable there with the number of people not wiping down machines or wearing masks improperly. There were so many people that I couldn't walk (or even LOOK) away from the equipment I was using without someone taking it or trying to ""work in"" with me, which is completely inappropriate during a pandemic. During one trip, a patron even yelled at me for not sharing the leg press machine and threatened to harm my significant other who was with me. Staff asked him to calm down but that was the only action taken. 

They also never got any weight trees which made it even more difficult to distance from other patrons - you have to roam around the gym searching for plates which are on machines being actively used since there are no separate trees to place them. There was also a lack of handle attachments for the cable machines. I stopped doing anything with the rope or straight bar handle because it always took 10 minutes just to track them down.

For awhile, I went to some of the smaller Club Fitnesses to avoid the crowd but two got shut down - Delmar and Hampton - and the one in Dogtown is just not very nice. I ended up driving to Rock Hill from CWE to go to the gym.

I switched to another gym. I do NOT miss the crowds at all. I do miss the nice equipment at Club Fitness and some of the amenities. Their cardio equipment is top notch compared to other gyms in the area.",2021-01-02 18:52:22,326,1609,
57hkdX7jvREZo8_iLD2dZQ,IaX73WNkQtspGsF3Xwgm8w,ElEbumta2ujV9PTx4OGbVw,4,1,0,0,"We've gone to Columbus Inn for special occasion dining in the past, but this weekend we finally got around to supporting their COVID-friendly curbside service, which is what this review will focus on. 

Columbus Inn does offer indoor dining, but I cannot comment on what that looks like as their takeout service is exclusively via curbside pick-up, which is both convenient and brilliant in terms of limiting foot traffic/exposures for the in-person guests. They are also offering delivery through DoorDash. 

We perused the menu via their ""Order Online"" button, only to find that their online ordering was not available. We were able to order by phone, which is not a big deal, but a bit misleading. 

We pulled into our curbside parking spot at 6:20, approx 5 min after the 6:15 time we'd been told. They have a phone number posted (that's different from the main restaurant number!) that you call on arrival and let them know which labeled parking spot you're in. Our food was finally handed to us around 6:30. 

Our $12 cocktails to-go were both decent pours that had no ice, so there was no risk of being watered down on the journey home. BF got the Autumn Smash, a delightful apple bourbon and apple cider mixture that is distinctly fall-in-a-glass but delicious in January nonetheless. My Tequila Sunset was excellent, and similarly fall themed: tequila, honey simple syrup, apple cider, and lemon. 

For our meal, we opted to split a pizza, a salad, and some vegetable sides between the two of us. We wound up finishing the salads and sides and saving 1/2 the pizza for the next day's lunch.

- The Cherry Pistachio Salad featured dried cherries (soaked in red wine) and fresh burrata over gem lettuce. The salad was yummy, but I don't remember finding any pistachios, and I was a little sad that the burrata was pre-cut --- how much of that creamy deliciousness was left behind on a cutting board? BF loved it, but I'd probably try a different salad next time. 

- The Kennett Pie is a white pizza that celebrates local Kennett mushrooms, herbed cheese, and goat cheese, accentuated with the sweetness of caramelized onions and the peppery freshness of arugula. A good flavor combo that we enjoyed.

- The crispy brussels sprouts are fried and dressed with Caesar dressing, bread crumbs, and Parmesan cheese --- would order these again and again. 

- The roasted cauliflower was a little underseasoned on its own, but I enjoyed the added crunch of almonds, sweetness of raisins, and the saltiness of occasional capers.

Finally, we finished our night with the PB Cup dessert --- a peanut butter tart with chocolate ganache. It was actually quite sizable and definitely delicious.

All in all, this was a great (though pricey) meal that was a nice change-up from the usual takeout staples.",2021-01-10 14:11:35,551,2797,

I may have been a plumber in my past life, but I sincerely doubt it.  Took me months to even figure out how to turn my water off to the house (turns out it's real easy, pun intended). Anyway, like an American tourist in a non-English speaking land, I wandered into the plumbing aisle armed only with the face plate of my faucet and a willingness to ask for help. Thankfully, RICK was there to explain what I needed and how to do the repair.  I went home, with the confidence of a lion who stumbled upon an antelope injury ward, and I got to work.  On step 5, I ran into trouble, released a slew of words I wouldn't dare say in front of the lions or antelopes, and went back to Lowe's. Ready to give up and call a pro, I found RICK again, explained the sitch, and he said: no, this is what you need, this is how to do it, this is how much pressure to apply, it's fine, you can do it. Again walking tall like a giraffe who just got up after tripping over some low-land vines he didn't see, I got home, did the back and forth twisting motion RICK told me to do, with my new vice-grips that RICK told me a needed, and voila, the pesky and low-quality plastic faucet cylinder came out. I replaced it, did all the things RICK told me to do, turned the water to the house back on, and... the drip is gone. I couldn't have done it without RICK and I owe him a huge debt of gratitude.

They put us in a room for four hours and brought in a representative from each department to share information about their area. The day started off with a video that had clips from a graduation and white coat ceremony from many years ago. We could tell purely based on enrollment numbers it was an old video. 

The President was the first to give his speech, he arrived 15 minutes late with no apology and what seemed to be a very unprepared speech with no welcome or apology for his lack of promptness. There was no opportunity for questions because he ran out of time. The next to talk was a professor that coordinated the clinicals, he focused on the opportunities the V.A. had to offer and nothing else. Once again no opportunity for questions. The financial aid department brought in two representatives, both were late, neither was the picture of a healthy individual, and neither advisor seemed to grasp the fact that the money students took out loans for had to be paid back, both just kept saying FAFSA would help you pay for school. 

One female professor who was an advisor came very well prepared with a slide show and presentation for her half hour time slot to talk about class structure and options.  She had time for questions and genuinely seemed to care about the students that were there for the visit. The two female student ambassadors that gave the tours were both local residents and had grown up in the area and weren't super involved in anything extra Logan offered. They couldn't articulate why they had chosen Logan other then it was close to family. Our ambassador couldn't even tell us what services were offered at the on campus clinic and bragged about how she was an anatomy tutor for lower level anatomy classes yet had never actually dissected her cadaver because of Covid.  Those giving their presentations multiple times suggested Logan was the only University to offer instruction on certain techniques, it was very misleading as we had visited other campus' that also taught those same techniques.

The actual tour showed a beautiful pristine campus with the bare necessities provided. The workout facilities on campus were minimal with no group fit classes offered. They did have an array of self directed club sports that could be paid for by Logan if a student files a request form. 

We left feeling like the school failed to standout as a top notch University that cared about our student, not one single person she met asked our student why she was considering Logan or why she wanted to become a chiropractor.",2021-01-26 21:36:05,494,2656,

This brand new boutique fitness studio located in the Grove mixes hip hop dancing, cardio and strength training to provide an incredible workout for people of any fitness level. Music thumps through the speakers as their energetic and motivating teachers lead you through some dance moves that make you feel fit for an MTV music video (when they had videos of course.) The moves are all very accessible, no matter how uncoordinated you may joke you are; you can always find a way to modify the dances being taught to meet your needs. But the studio isn't JUST dance. Several times a day they offer ""Yes Strength"" classes that are more aligned with classic aerobics classes that aim to improve your cardio with a little taste of muscle toning using weights and resistance bands. And you don't even have to worry about bringing your own equipment. Everything is provided for you, and well cleaned after each class by Yes Honey staff members.

The location is so easy to get to from Rt. 44. It's located on the ground floor of the Woodward Lofts on Tower Grove Avenue. Parking is free and simple. What I really appreciate is how well lit the parking lot, making it feel so much more safe after evening classes. 

Aesthetically the studio is breathtaking. I can remember walking in for the first time and feeling as if I had been transported to a high-end West Hollywood workout facility. Every detail is not only well designed but SO Instagramable (I mean really, did you even workout if you didn't post a pic on IG??) The workout space is massive. Even if you were not required to leave your mask on during classes, there's plenty of space between you and other fitness fanatics to feel safe from COVID.  They also leave all the windows in the space open to help circulation. Overall they are really doing everything right to keep us all safe during classes. 

As if the space and workouts weren't fabulous enough, Yes Honey also offers online virtual classes. So you can get your butt kicked from the comfort of your own home! The videos are easy to access through the same app used to sign up for classes. 

The idea of dancing in a brightly lit room sounds incredibly intimidating, but the community at Yes Honey is SO welcoming. There is absolutely no judgment. Everyone is there to have fun and work off a few quarantine calories. When I went for a workout I had a huge (masked) smile on my face the entire time. You can't help but feed off the positive energy created by the staff of Yes Honey!",2021-01-13 23:36:20,527,2645,

THE ROOM: very neat and clean, we got a room upgrade witch made our stay a lot better, more comfortable for the family. This room was super duper Spacious, almost too spacious, they should throw in a couch or something and Microwave, no microwave only Mini fridge.  


OVERALL: we had a decent vacation, it was comfortable. This is our second time staying here. I recommend Nugget for the family for a nice get away vacation. Maybe not for a super special vacation like birthdays or anniversary, not super exciting(maybe due to pandemic) maybe. I would and will definitely stay here again! This is a Great Hotel to stay at.",2021-01-20 21:24:08,351,1666,

We went on a slow night- I think it was a Thursday? It was pretty quiet in there. I mean, COVID and a weeknight. Hopefully it's not always like that. We had a reservation but showed up super early and they seated us. 

The restaurant itself is really pretty and elegant. The menu isn't huge but I always say, do a few things and do them well. They do! 

We had a pair of servers- one was in training. They were both excellent, knowledgeable, and friendly. 

We ordered the calamari appetizer and it was a great start to our meal. It had a really good sauce on it, almost like a sweet chili type sauce. So good. I then experienced one of the best steaks of my life. It came out sizzling hot with butter melted all over it and it was perfectly rare in the middle and seared on the outside. I really really love steak and I'm a purist. I don't need sauces or glazes on my steak. This steak nailed it. Simply seasoned and so juicy and flavorful that I almost regretted having an appetizer because I started getting full! My husband had steak and lobster. The lobster was perfectly cooked- tender, sweet, and delicious. Along with the steaks, we got creamed spinach and lobster Mac & cheese. The spinach was really good but the lobster Mac & cheese... THAT was the star of the whole show. I'm drooling just remembering how perfect and rich and creamy and flavorful it was. So, so good. I would go back just for that. And after all that, we still managed to cram in the yummy creme brûlée they provided for our dessert. I basically needed to be rolled out of the restaurant after. And we brought dinner leftovers  home for our kids who also raved about how delicious it all was. 

Of course, it was a quite expensive dinner. Not something we can afford to do on the regular. For our yearly anniversary splurge, it was well worth it and a highly enjoyable experience.",2021-01-20 04:42:29,422,2000,

We were told we would still have over an hour wait once we got there for our reservation. They reassured us the table would only take 2-3 minutes to clear once the guests left who were sitting at the only table they would allow us at. After waiting and waiting yet still being told another 15-20 mins every 15-20 mins for an hour one of the managers had walked by and we started asking more questions. Like why we couldn't sit at the other large table that was opened or join some of the smaller tables together to seat us. All we got back was that they were closed. The manager also informed us that the guests at our table had been there for over 2 hours and were done eating. They were only talking and playing on their phones. I had to ask if the staff could start clearing some of the table so that maybe the guests would get the hint and they told me they had placed the cleaning bucket and sprays on the table next to them. 
Keep in mind as adults we can hold off a little to wait to eat, but there's 2 very young kids who are starving at this point and that's a very different thing now. They don't understand why we are just standing there for so long when there's other people coming in to get seated right away and even 3 groups of 6 who get their food before we can even get seated. How can you even expect 2 kids to not get antsy, upset or even cry from waiting so long? 
I asked the staff again if they could finish clearing the table of even the napkins or empty drink cups since no one was even touching them. One of the men grabbed 3 cups off the table and that was it. 
Why was the staff not trying to get them out of there respectfully or professionally at the least? Why didn't the manager step in and mention that there was another party who had a reservation for their table and they needed to clear it? The guests had already paid and received their final receipts and to go boxes plus to go drinks yet still sat there! As a manager I don't understand why she didn't step in! We ended up leaving since the kids were crying from hunger! Our reservation was for 7:00pm and when we finally left it was 8:40pm! We waited almost 2 full hours passed our reservation!! 
Needless the say longhorn lost out on roughly a $300 bill plus tip that we would've easily spent with our party of 8. Not to mention they are loosing more customers because of their poor management! I can't even imagine how much revenue they are truly loosing from the way they handle things or I should say don't handle things!",2021-01-18 04:20:11,547,2629,

In 2018 I submitted a request to have the PMI waived, as home prices had gone up in my area. NewRez sent an appraiser (at my expense) that failed to include my next door neighbor's home in the comps that had sold about 3-4 months before the appraisal. When I contacted the appraiser to bring this to their attention, they told me they would need a request from NewRez to have it examined. NewRez requested that I collect several documented sales in my area that were not included in the original comps and submit to them. I did not pursue this, as they also told me I did not have a loan with them long enough to have the PMI dropped. 

I tried again in 2020 to have the PMI waived, and again was rejected after another appraisal at my expense. This time, NewRez sent me a letter offering me a paydown amount to remove the PMI. I paid more than the amount they asked for in the letter, and they did not remove the PMI. When I contacted them, they said it was an error and asked me to pay more if I wanted the PMI removed. I contacted a lawyer and was in the middle of putting a case together, but ended up refinancing with another company instead. The new company did not charge me a PMI and did not require an appraisal on the new loan. 

My refinance closed in Sept 2020, and I still have not received my full escrow refund as of writing this review. NewRez sent me a letter on December 1 stating they sent a check for the remaining escrow refund, but I did not receive it. I called a few weeks later and was told they would reissue the check. Still no check. When I called a third time, they told me they kept the funds (with no authorization from me and no billing statement to prove this) and applied it to a PMI payment that was due. I have requested documentation from them regarding the mysterious PMI payment that was due after my loan closed. At this point, it would cost me more to get an attorney again than to just drop it and cut my losses. I caution anyone considering doing business with NewRez...their practices are at least unethical, if not illegal.",2021-01-29 22:26:24,455,2191,

The Indiana Pacers began in Indy in 1967, when I was only 2-years-old. While I'm fairly certain my life at that point was distracted by surviving spina bifida, the truth is I've been an Indiana Pacers fan since those early days when the Pacers started out in the former American Basketball Association. 

The Pacers were part of the ABA from 1967-1976. It was the days of George McGinnis, Billy Keller, Darnell Hillman, and countless others who remain icons in Indy including longtime coach Bob ""Slick"" Leonard. 

When the ABA folded and multiple teams went under the NBA umbrella, the Pacers were one of them. These days, of course, they play out of Bankers Life Fieldhouse and the Indiana Fever, our WNBA team, are included under the Pacers Sports and Entertainment umbrella and under the ownership of Herb Simon. 

Under the ownership of the Simons, the Pacers have become a stable fixture of Indy. At one point, it appeared they might be bought by out-of-towners. That's a scary prospect in a mid-level market city as the risk of relocation is always there. 

The Pacer colors are Navy Blue, Gold, and Cool Gray. The new and current coach is Nate Bjorkgren and Kevin Pritchard is our GM. 

The Indiana Pacers won 3 ABA championships; they've yet to win an NBA championship. They won an NBA conference title in 2000. They've won 9 total division titles - 3 in the ABA, 6 in the NBA with the most recent being in 2014. 

They've retired 5 numbers - 30 (George McGinnis), 31 (Reggie Miller), 34 (Mel Daniels), 35 (Roger Brown), and 529 (Coach Bobby Leonard). 

The Indiana Pacers have certainly had their occasional controversies, but they've long been a beloved symbol of Indiana's love of basketball. It's a love I grew up - I was a Junior Pacer as a young kid and received an award from Larry Bird himself for community service as an adult. 

The Indiana Pacers has eight former players and three former coaches who are members of the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame. 

A few fun facts - Reggie Miller continues to hold the franchise record for point scored (25,279), minutes played (47,619), assists (4,141), steals (1,505), and most 3-pointers made (2,560). 

If I had to pick an all-time favorite player, it would likely be Billy Keller. Reggie Miller is an undeniable fave whose kindness was well known including donating items for a charity auction I did for my Tenderness Tour. 

The Pacers organization has long worked to balance fiscal responsibility with a strong sense of community. It has left a solid imprint on Indy through a variety of charitable endeavors and generally has long been recognized as a quality organization. While some players certainly leave in search of bigger fame, paychecks, or spotlights, we've had some remarkable loyalty over the years (including Reggie Miller's entire career - along with that of Tamika Catchings for the Fever). 

I can't imagine a day when I won't be madly passionate about my Indiana Pacers. Like any fan, I haven't agreed with every decision or situation but watching the Pacers over the years has probably been my greatest sports joy along with Mario Andretti in auto racing. 

The Indiana Pacers continue to play as part of the NBA's Eastern Conference.",2021-01-20 07:27:22,660,3302,

I meet a couple of my cousins here for lunch during the ARW. For me it was an affordable way to experience another restaurant in my new hood. 

The lunch special that I choose was, a large house salad with a soda or ice tea. However, I did not want a soda, so I opted to enjoy a Pinot Grigio instead. The salad was huge and made with Romaine and Iceberg lettuce. It also had multiple toppings, including; ham, volpi salami, shredded provel, parmesan, black olives, tomato, onion and pepperoncini. It was served with Decaro's creamy house Italian dressing on the side.  I like my dressing on the side, so I have control of how much I use. It was a meal! 

Before our lunches, we shared an order of Toasted Ravioli. A trip to a St Louis area Italian restaurant, is not complete without enjoying an order. The order was six jumbo sized raviolis, which was easy to divide up among three diners. The raviolis were round, and crispy around the edges, with the rest being perfectly toasted. The red sauce on the side for dipping, had enough flavor to do the job, but was not mind blowing. 

The service was hit and miss at first, then extra staff showed up to help with the large crowd that had arrived for the lunch. Since this ARW was taking place during a pandemic, they were following the CDC guidelines and tables were spaced for social distancing. 

The ambiance is minimal, but that kind of adds to the charm. I plan on returning, the pizzas and pasta dishes that I saw being served to other tables, looked pretty good.

On line ordering could not accept our gift cards, so we had to call in.  We called in and the young lady started to take our order, we got half way through placing our order when the young lady had a conversation with someone at the restaurant.  She came back on the line and asked if I could call back in 30 minutes.  I said OK and called back in the requested time thinking we would just pick up where we left off, OH NO.  I was told they could not take my order, could I call back in an hour and thirty minutes.  Damn surprised and not too happy we did not get to enjoy a Bella Milano meal last Saturday.  
This Saturday we thought we will get out ahead of the rush, we called in early at 2:45PM and place our order for a 5:00pm pickup.  We let the young lady know that we would pick up the order and pay with our gift cards.  At this point all is good!
I hit some traffic and arrived about 8 minutes late.  The young lady told me most of the order was ready and they would be right with me.  Ten minutes later I asked if I could at least pay for my order which I did.  Several pick up orders went out the door while I waited and still no order for me.  An older gentleman came up to me, did not identify himself and asked if he could help.  As I was starting to explain my displeasure, my order came from the back.  I told him I could not understand how an order placed several hours ahead with an expected delivery time could be 35 minutes late.  He did apologize, which I appreciate, but I am left to wonder, what time were the orders placed that were constantly leaving the restaurant while I waited.   What is the formula that I need to use the next time, do I add 35 minutes to my lead time?  Does it take 2 hours and 35 minutes to prepare the food we ordered?   (By the way the food was great, as it always is.) We had to warm a few things that had been sitting since 5:00.  
Please Bella Milano management, what formula should I use next time,?  How early do we have to place an order to receive it at the requested pick up time?",2021-01-17 01:08:51,461,2119,

Cons: Not an ""up-to-date"" hotel. 

I did much research prior to booking our hotel for our anniversary trip. My husband had never been to New Orleans so I felt it best to stay in the French Quarter. Many hotels had great ratings on the hotel sites but poor Yelp ratings and if I've learned anything, it's to check Yelp prior to booking any hotel!! 

The night we arrived was a bit unnerving. Check-in was alright. We were given directions as to wear our room was but they weren't great directions so we had to go back to the front desk to check again. Upon arriving to our room we noticed the ac wasn't working. It was cool outside but we were warm from walking all over creation to find the room. We called the front desk and they sent a woman up that seemed to be bitching at us about turning the unit down to much. I painfully expressed to her that this was not how we wanted to start our vacation. She offered to change us to the room next door. Upon moving to the room next door, that ac wasn't working either. 
A maintenance person came up, checked something and left. Another maintenance person came up, checked something and decided a ladder was needed to open vents. That person came back with the wrong size ladder. This guy was polite and probably as annoyed as we were at this point. He apologized and went to get another ladder. He returned with a different ladder and opened the vents. 
He again apologized and said a complimentary bottle of champagne would be brought up. 
We were very pleased by that! It was around 11pm and nothing was open nearby to even grab a cocktail. (Due to covid) 
We did believe it to be a nice gesture and cured our desire to call Hotels.com to share our frustration. 
The following day the staff we encountered was polite and offered suggestions for lunch. We were walking distance to Cafe Du Monde for breakfast but I believe the hotel offered a grab n go type breakfast. 
Overall we were pleased with our stay. I'd recommend booking a regular room as our ""upgraded"" room with a tiny window wasn't worth the money.",2021-01-09 08:34:02,443,2164,
pytoYK9UmRhjpWVDPTpIXg,mNsrvbvPCwWx9_0GordRvw,dwOsLnuXq2RthkEN9m3lAw,5,1,0,0,"I used to make pilgrimages to NYC, first to Zabar's on the Upper West Side when I lived in the Riverdale section of the Bronx 35 years ago.  Much later I detoured to Russ & Daughters on Houston Street on the Lower East Side when my son lived right above it (and BTW, 100 years ago people worked hard to leave those tenements - not sure why their great-grandkids are paying a fortune to move back to live in not much more spacious quarters in the same buildings).

I tell you this because I am a bit of an unapologetic lox-snob.

I have found some places in Philadelphia that are generally pretty darned good in that department.  DiBruno's in Rittenhouse Square will slice you up some mean nova and sometimes Pastrami smoked-salmon (if it's in stock and they can find it).  Likewise Hymie's on Montgomery Avenue in Lower Merion won't disappoint you.

But let's face it, Philadelphians, we've never had a place where the fish is the unadorned star.  So when I heard about Biederman's, I figured it was worth a look-see.

Let's just say it's worth much more than a look-see, or even a look-see-taste.  The quality of the fish here, and the care with which it's prepared, is quite excellent.  We brought home the pastrami smoked salmon and the white fish salad.  The smoked salmon was very well curated (the only word I can use to describe the care with which it was packaged), and it tasted other-worldly with a Kaplan's bagel (bought at Kaplan's for the wholesale price - no way am I paying $18.00 a dozen at Biederman's - sorry).  The white fish was also great, much more fish the mayonnaise, and no old-fish smell you often get with white fish salad.

If I have a couple of quibbles (and they are just that and won't affect the 5-star rating), I'd like to see them try to slice the fish just a little thinner, and I found a very small (gasp) grey spot on one of the slices.  That's OK, but if Biederman's is so close to perfect, I'd like to see it get from 98% to a perfect 100%.",2021-01-23 19:01:40,428,1979,

I feel that they have a great mission behind what they're doing for the community and I enjoy the health and nourishment that their menu options provide. I hadn't been to this location in a while and I'm used to the menu option being quite different but I did appreciate the options that they had.

The staff are always so friendly and they're always so accommodating to any preferences and dietary needs and restrictions on individuals may have. I find that if somebody has an allergy this is the place that you should go as they are so kind and ask questions if you have any thing they should be aware of.

I had the falafel bowl which was delicious. I very much so appreciated the crispiness and warmth of the falafel as it was nice and crunchy. The kale was marinated beautifully and the sauce was just right. I would admit there was a little bit of the dishware I did feel that there was a little too much salt however that can sometimes become in at restaurants. In general I left feeling refreshed nourished and that I had just had something healthy and good for my body. 

To anyone that is vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free you should definitely give this spot a shot as I am certain you'll find something on the menu to satisfy your body.  

This spot is doing great with their Covid precautions and they also have seating outdoors in cubes that have space heaters on the inside so that you are completely eating in your own area. 

Typically there is parking not too far that you can typically find for free. In addition this is located right on the Monon so you are able to walk or bike to the spot as well.

My boyfriend called this place and set up two Polynesian manicures for my friend and I for my birthday and set his credit card info up with the front desk and prematurely added a 30% gratuity on his card. This particular manicure is suppose to be a really nice exfoliation, massage, oils, etc. then we added a 5$ each dip powder charge. At some point in the manicure I got nervous because we hadn't received lotion or a massage so I thought maybe they did it at the end. I then mentioned something about the Polynesian but because the woman didn't speak the best English I think she thought I said Paraffin? I'm not sure but the communication wasn't well. So finally the entire manicure is over my friend and I decide well check with the front desk to see if there was confusion (to be honest this was MY mistake for waiting to long). The lady at the front desk proceeds to tell me no we only got the basic manicure. However I know this can't be correct because not only did my boyfriend clarify with the front desk but I called and clarified with the front desk that it was the Polynesian. I'm irritated because BOTH OF US called and clarified this so why was there confusion. So whatever she charges us for the plain manicure she goes to ask for my card I told her my boyfriend prepaid. She said there was no card on file. She then proceeds to apologize which was nice but then scapegoats their manager named Anna because apparently Anna cannot work the computer system well (okay then why is Anna a manager)? At this point I'm not even angry I'm just sorta let down. Because this was suppose to be something special for my birthday and I'm now paying on my own card for a manicure that was sub par. I mean I've been to a lot of cheap nail salons and even THOSE at least put some lotion on your hands. She kindly takes 15% off but at that point they had also charged us $10 each to remove our nail polish $5 each for the dip gel and the manicure (with NO oils or lotion or even a small hand rub was $50 before the discount). Talk about nickel and diming I mean come on. 

I still tipped the woman 20% and the desk lady was very apologetic but I just wish someone had taken notes or made notes of the interactions. When you charge that much at a salon and spa you might want to follow up on your end by providing $$$ kind of service. I worked fine dining and there are higher expectations with higher price tags. It was my birthday and my boyfriend was so excited to treat me and this was just sort of a bummer. It wouldn't hurt to take notes and add them to bookings.

My husband and I ordered several dishes from the menu to see how they compared with our favorite pho place. While some of the vegetables were not quite as fresh or of high quality and the meat was not as nice of a cut, almost all of the dishes were delicious and cost significantly less than what we usually pay. We usually pay $10 for spring rolls and egg rolls, but they were only $4 at Pho 813. Perhaps the vegetables weren't organic and the portions of meat were smaller, but everything was tasty so I felt like it was a fair trade off.

The highlight of our meal was the roasted quail appetizer. This was one of the most unique dishes on the menu. I don't remember the last time I have had quail. The meat was tender and juicy and was fragrant with flavor. My pork bahn mi may not have contained tender pork tenderloin, but other than a few tough pieces of pork it was freaking delicious and all the flavors were spot on. The baguette was warm and chewy and the meat was well seasoned and packed some heat from the fresh jalapeño. Did I mention the price? Only $8 for this sandwich! My husband enjoyed his beef deluxe pho and my boys loved their grilled chicken and fried rice platter. Portions were extremely generous. The one dish I would skip ordering in the future is the Vietnamese style filet mignon. At $17 we should have expected the chewy steak that we received. This is one of the most expensive and lackluster dishes on the menu.

Of course, it's impossible for me to go in and just get 1 cupcake, so I usually leave with at least 4-6. Today's visit was no different. 

They are open for walk ins during this time and they also offer online and phone orders with either carry-out or curbside pick up. They have a notice that no more than 3 customers are allowed inside at any given time, so make sure you wait your turn if needed. When I arrived today, I was able to walk in since there was only 1 other customer in the shop. I took a few minutes to look through their current offerings and I snapped a few photos too. 

When I was ready to order, I let the girl know that I was going to order 4 cupcakes. I asked for 2 of their January specials (the Buckeye and the German Chocolate) and I asked for 2 of their classics; the Confetti (for my birthday) and the double chocolate (hubby's favorite flavor). She had them packed up and ready to go so fast and offered to put the box in a bag, but I told her that it wasn't necessary.

Low and behold,  they try to tell me that the screw is too far to the side which I know more than enough about cars and tires to know its more than bullshit, but because of time constraints and me needing this tire, I'm gulping up the 50 bucks since I do have the tire roadhazard warranty.   I could have literally just taken this tire to a tire shop to get it repaired within 5 minutes. But, instead it took this guy over 40 minutes just to replace and balance a tire. The manager knew j was obviously annoyed by this but this guy could care less. I stand outside to see why it is taking so long to repair a tire and replace and the guy fixing it is taking his sweet time and talking to another guy for 10 minutes. It was nothing related to neither the cars or business. So, stop wasting people's valuable time. It may not be a speed race to get this issue fixed and maybe I'm being a bit impatient but at the end of the day it still should never take more than 10 or so minutes to get a tire inspected, replaced or repaired, fitted, balanced  and mounted back onto the vehicle. You may have scammed money out of me, but it was unfortunately knowingly. I'm sure they do this to very many people. Find some workers with better business ethics and don't seem lazy as hell to do the job they are being paid to do.",2021-01-14 22:37:49,395,1804,

I've avoided writing a review here because my love for Potbelly is long standing. I think my family discovered them in West Lafayette about 16 or 17 years ago, and I was hooked immediately. I've since eaten at many locations in multiple states, and I don't remember a single bad experience until frequenting this store.

I order the tuna salad sandwich 95% of the time I eat at Potbelly. I just love the way their hot peppers complement the tuna salad. On multiple occasions, the tuna salad has been SO dry here. For some reason, it doesn't seem their employees can follow the tuna salad recipe. One time, I had to ask for mayo packets to put on my sandwich because it seemed like they just gave me flaked tuna straight out of a can. So bad. 

Now since 2020, I've started ordering on their app and picking up carry out in the store a lot. It is a very handy way to be able to grab a meal ... if you could trust that they make your sandwich well. Unfortunately that only happens at this location about half of the time.  They don't seem to be able to follow notes requests well. I like extra hot peppers. I only get this on my sandwich every couple times. This I deal with, but what I can't deal with is getting home with a sandwich that has about half the normal amount of meat on it and completely torched, dry bread. If they're cutting corners and not putting the adequate amount of meat and cheese on, their toaster completely burns and dries the bread. Inedible. 

Things like this happen at this store too often. I've contacted Potbelly HQ about it when the store wasn't very old (after the no mayo tuna salad incident) ... that they need better training for a consistent experience, but this store just doesn't seem to be able to get a handle on it. I wish this weren't the store that was local to my work commute. I want to stop eating here. But I love Potbelly. It's frustrating.",2021-01-09 19:25:04,414,1960,

As in, ""Would my year be any worse, if I picked a new Asian hairstylist (in Tucson, of all places) for my unruly and unhappy hair from some random Yelp reviews and had her cut and color my hair?""

My hair was a mess. My previous color was transforming into a hue that is reminiscent of the Great Dumpster Fire of 2020, while also suffering from the effects of the hard Tucson water.  

Esther, the owner of Salon 520, spent about the first 5+ minutes brushing out the tangles in my hair (that's how bad it was), then we discussed what color and style I wanted. I didn't bring any pictures, realizing now, after many decades - that the gorgeous pixie cut on Halle Berry and the cascade of beautifully-coiffed curls that Sandra Oh sports can only be maintained with an entourage of hair stylists and unlimited time and resources. 

Esther seemed to know exactly what I was looking for in terms of color and style. The hair coloring products she used  worked quickly (some Italian quick-coloring formula, she said), without heat, and very little smell. She cut just enough hair off to lighten the weight of the hair and to give it enough volume.

She was very careful to explain what she was going to do and what products she was using throughout the 2.5 hours I was with her. We also talked for most of the time, so the hours passed quickly. While the color at first appeared darker than natural, I rather liked the Goth look, and now -several weeks later, the red highlights are coming through..

Esther's salon is spacious  and high-ceilinged. She has a strict protocol for Covid (ie. Masks only, hand sanitizer, dirty/clean pens) and will even provide you with a disposable mask, so that you don't mess up the one you're wearing while she's washing/coloring your hair.

Esther is recently from California and has worked with Asian, as well as non-Asian hair. The products she uses are quality and her experience comes through with her technique and confidence in styling hair. I feel that her pricing is reasonable for her skill and experience level. In Tucson, it's easy to pay wayy more for a cut and style that is wayy less than what I'd imagined.

I am SO HAPPY that (1) there was finally something to be happy about in 2020; and, (2) my hair grows quickly, so I'll be back to see her again in 2021!",2021-01-17 19:36:15,495,2366,

So, I'm a woman of a ""certain"" age: (read 53) and besides going under the knife for a facelift (not there yet LOL, maybe another 10 years) I've tried every procedure you can imagine to tighten my skin, address my jowls and give my neck a little tightening refresh. You feel me ladies? I won't bore you with all the procedures I've tried. I will however, tell you what drives me batshit insane ( and has taken me years to realize because I guess I'm not that sharp). Is when you go for a cosmetic consultation and advise what is bothering you and what you really want some help with, again in my case (drooping skin around my cheeks, jowls and neck) and what they say will ""absolutely work"" for you is what they have in their office!!! Are you following me here? Not, oh sorry we 'd love to help you but this $500 chemical peel will solve the problem, or microdermasion is just what you need to lift those jowls. How about..... no sorry that's not a
good fit for you but I might have a solution for you to investigate. DONT sell me something I DONT want or need to line your pockets. I'm not rich! I work to save up for these procedures. I work hard for my money and the sad part is I would more than likely come back to you for that chemical peel or dermabrasion if you were just honest from the beginning!!!  Am I making sense here ladies (and gents) I don't expect miracles or to look 30 again (heavy sigh) but I do expect some form of straight up honesty and realistic expectations. Don't even get me started with Ultherapy. Very Painful and in my opinion waste of money. Maybe for other issues so I don't want to totally knock it but certainly not a success for me. (NOT cheap either)!  So with all that said LOL, I think I did some pretty intense research this time not only on the latest procedures but practitioners which is where Dr. Lisa at LaChele comes into the picture. My consultation was with Dr Espinoza. She took one look at me and knew what I needed. Facetite for my jowls and Morpheus 8 to treat fine lines and wrinkles. ( Read up on the procedures folks) BUT, it's not just the machine/apparatus you need an experienced practitioner who has a artists eye. I got that from Lisa right away. I was very nervous so I barely heard a word she said during the first consultation LOL. I must have called back 5 times and spoken with either Lisa or Melissa who ALWAYS called me back, didn't make me feel like a high maintenance pain in the ass and very directly set my expectations. Absolutely no hard sell here just a straight up assessment of what to expect. It was my decision to make. I had the procedure done this past Monday 1/11 because I needed some thing to boost my confidence and forget about 2020. I am very swollen ( to be expected) no bruising at all and I bruise easy. I'm not sure if that had to do with the MEND supplement they recommended (picture below) but I'm glad I bought it. In my package I have two more Morpheus sessions so I will set these up in the next few months. Oh, and one last thing the facetite was a breeze. Completely numbed, didn't feel a thing and the Xanax , well what can I say, Xanax fixes everything. My only constructive criticism would be to numb the face again next time before the Morpheus. That my friends was a little painful.  Next time I will ask for more numbing on the Morpheus but Lana was fantastic. Here are some pics (three days) after and a few prior to the procedure but for the first time I feel hopeful. Sit down before you see the price and take a deep breath.....$4,700. Yes, I know!!! I will certainly follow up in a few months to hopefully see it was worth it. Thank you, Lisa, Melissa and Lana. You guys are a GREAT CREW and I have high hopes. My very best, Kim Butner",2021-01-13 12:58:23,840,3835,

I had a water pipe start leaking at my home. The pipe was right outside and I was able to dig it up and find the bad elbow that was leaking. However, the pipe was copper so that's when I hit a wall. I started calling around for quotes and estimates on what it would cost to fix. 

When I called Nathan's, a scheduler answered and I explained my problem to her. She gave me an idea of what two hours of work would cost and we both thought it shouldn't take any longer than two hours. Now -- when she went to find me a day to come out she said she wanted to make sure she sent ""the plumbing guy"" with the most experience. This was *important* to me because I was under the impression I'd be getting someone well versed in piping. So, I agreed to wait several days and went with Nathan's thinking I'd be getting ""the guy"" for pipe issues and that we were looking at around two hours of work. 

On my scheduled day, James arrived. James is amazing, very friendly, allowed me to ask questions, etc. -- James is absolutely great. However, he can't be ""the guy"" because before we started he had to call someone else to ask some questions about how to tackle the job. I'm *fine* with this because I want it done right. But at that point I realize they didn't send me a plumbing expert, they were just busy and it was going to be a few days wait (just tell people that! I'd be less upset if you'd have just said that and not said you were sending ""the guy""). 

James worked on the pipe for about an hour. We turn it on and we've cut the main pipe wrong -- this is *my* fault because I got bad info from the homeowner about which pipe went where. So we're an hour in and James has to go back to the store for new items to fix the new issue that has arisen.

At this point, I'm still fine. This was my fault. So James comes back and now we enter a ""troubleshooting"" phase where James is trying to figure out the best way to attach a pipe to another pipe. I'm thinking this should take an hour and we'll still be at two hours. That hour passes and I say ok, three hours. Three hours tops.  This ends up taking several more trips to the store, several taking things on/off, and ends up taking four more hours. So the two hour job takes five hours. I'm not upset that it took longer because in the end, the pipe is fixed and hopefully I never have to see it again. I'm happy with what James did and that he stayed and fixed it. 

Here is where I get upset: 
Had the company not alluded they were sending me an expert plumbing/pipe guy, I would have not been upset that this took five hours (most of which were troubleshooting and having to go back to the store). But since they said this was going to be ""the guy"" I expected a $200-250 bill. Instead, I got a great guy who did fix the issue but the time it took cost me a great deal more money ($466) because of all the troubleshooting that went on. Had the company not said they'd be sending me an expert in this area, then I may have even went with a different company. 

The job James did is great. It works now. What I take issue with is the scheduling person saying they were sending an expert for a two hour job, then getting something different that took 5 hours and maybe more troubleshooting than an expert would have needed. 

I'm glad the pipe is taken care of. But based on this very costly experience--and feeling like they duped me a little by saying if I could wait they had an expert in the field--I don't think I'd use them again. I now am wary to trust their word over the phone (not James, James I trust! He's awesome). So... I don't know if I'd recommend them or use them again... But hopefully my case is a one-off issue.",2021-01-22 16:33:41,856,3753,

I was stranded in a hospital while my wife was in labor and we decided to order out. After the delivery of our baby boy, we decided to treat ourselves and get some friend sea food. We ended up using door dash and getting Don's Seafood. She ordered the 1/2 catfish and 1/2 shrimp party tray for $75.00. It was pricey but the price was worth it. The amount of food they included in this order was insane. We ended up having left overs for days. 

The food was received about 1 hour after order. It was still hot and nice and crisp. It came in some easy containers that could have been easily recycled. 

The taste of the food was good and it had plenty of favor. I am not a massive fan of fried food but this was a restaurant worth looking into. It has a very ""New Orleans"" type of flavor. The catfish was delicious. The shrimp was crispy but had the tails on them. The french bread was not very crunchy and felt just right. The hush puppies are always my favorite but I have always been a glutton for them. 

Now, I was unable to experience the restaurant experience but based on the quality of the food and the great cooking, it might surely be worth looking into the location itself. It is off of Veteran's Memorial Blvd., so it is not far from most locations in Metairie. The food was worth the experience, so the restaurant must be as well!

A simple call fixed that. It's easiest and less crowded to go mid week, so I booked on a Monday. On the phone, they did explain that it would take a little over an hour for instruction and 2 minute flying time as well as a high flight. You must arrive 15 minutes before your allotted time. When I entered, they checked my temp and had me sign a waiver. I did get offered a deal for an extra 2 minutes for $24 that included free videos too, once I checked in. I decided not to get it at check in but then changed my mind. Changing my mind later increased the $24 to $30. 
I waited for about 5-10 minutes watching others fly, which was cool. There were 4 other people there besides me. Brad was my instructor and the video explaining everything was short and simple. Brad explained how it all works and the hand signals. To fly, you need closed shoes, which I did not have but was given with disposable socks. I got a helmet and goggles as well as a jump suit. They cleaned helmets and goggles after each use. The socks go to the garbage. After suiting up, in we go. It was just me with the instructor. Woot! Flying was truly easy and fun, if you listen carefully to the instructor, you can fly unassisted most of the time. I did so well that Brad showed me how to do up down and 360 turns. 4 minutes of pure fun and adrenaline rush! The higher flight was amazing too! Brad just held on to me and we went high up in the tube. It's pretty cool. All in all I really enjoyed it and would recommend it.

Only the second Chuck Lager America's Tavern in the U.S., due to Covid & Covid restrictions this dream became a 1.5 year expedition. 

Once the Wiregrass Mall space was renovated, the workings of the restaurant took shape under managers Tim & Sergio (the latter a former self-trained chef), both sent from Philadelphia to get Chuck Lager on its feet & soaring. Chef Cynthia, hailing from New Jersey, joined the team. 

The menu is the brainchild of Fabio Viviani, who created the original menu for the Delaware location. (Viviani competed on ""Top Chef,"" a culinary competition that began in 2006 on the Bravo network.) The menu consists of comfort foods from many genres-- fish, chicken, steak, tacos, nachos, veggies, fries, pastas, burgers, salads, flatbreads, 4 desserts, etc. There is something for every hungry member of the dining party, including beers, wines, & cocktails! And, BOY, IS THE FOOD GOOD! 

We ordered two appetizers, a handheld, a burger, a pasta entree, & a side-- just wanted to really sample what we had heard so much about! Everything was DELICIOUS. Unlike traditional American dishes, each recipe is tweaked to capitalize on freshness, flavors, & textures. It's those unique added touches that titillate the palate & the olfactory senses-- making for a VERY happy dining experience. The recommended Sweet Thai Chili House Smoked Wings ($12) were perfectly seasoned & cooked to just the right amount of crispness-- EXCELLENT! The pork belly-topped Deviled Eggs ($10) that both managers recommended were DIVINE. The Chicken Parmesean over noodles ($19) was a large serving & the best my companion had ever eaten; & the Smoked Brisket Grilled Cheese @ $12 (To Go) was LOVED by its recipient. My Aztec Burger w/ guacamole & bacon ($16) was recommended by superior server Karri; it was VERY GOOD, as were the Sweet Potato Fries for an upcharge of $1. Even the Cesar side salad ($7) was an original-- the sundried tomatoes made it a standout in color & taste-- see pic. Foods we didn't try, but that were highly recommended by management, were the Tuna Poke Nachos, the Steak Fritas, the Italian Steak, Chuck's Citrus Salmon, & probably a few others I've sadly forgotten. But we shall not fret for we SHALL return to try them all! YES, THAT'S HOW GOOD THE FOOD WAS! I'm already salivating for the Ahi nachos! Lol. (Returned two nights later. Unfortunately not a big fan of the Grouper Tacos @ $14. Not much grouper & not much flavor pizazz-- rather uneventful, unfortunately.)

10 cocktails; 10 bottles/cans; 7 wines (red/white); 7 House Barrell wines; 16 craft beers; 4 domestic beers; 4 imported beers; 6 Flights; & 24 Bourbons & Whiskeys (2 oz pour) round out the alcoholic beverage offerings. 

The restaurant appears to be divided into two main dining sections w/ a central bar area. There are also 10-12 wall TVs for your sporting entertainment. There's a second bar behind glass that leads to the larger covered patio on the Eastside. And there's an additional covered patio on the Southside where you'll find the main entrance. Both are complete w/ stylish bronze metal tables & chairs-- see pic.

Everyone we encountered here today was very friendly, & they appeared genuine. Our server was very personable, professional, attentive, & knowledgeable of the menu. The kitchen staff moved quickly. This establishment is very busy later in the evenings, w/ reservations for Friday & Saturday evenings strongly recommended. (Go online to reserve your nightly table from 6 PM until close; no reservations are taken prior to 6 PM.)

Over that time I've witnessed and been a victim of sharp decline in staff workers' performance & level of competence as well as civility. Last year I started a 'comparison' experiment between Penn Medicine and Lankenau/Main Line Health. I called to schedule an appointment either for a physician I've seen previously or as a new patient.  

In each instance, upon calling Penn Medicine (800 number), I was transferred to someone whose attitude was clear: disinterested in helping, listening or communicating. It was abundantly clear that my call was burdensome, something to be ended as quickly as possible with the least amount of effort.  The front line workers at Penn Medicine are, unfortunately, the same. Numerous mistakes were made time and time again. From scheduling to being escorted to the doctors office, these workers exhibit boredom for the most part, and when I asked questions, they were barely acknowledged let alone answered. 

When calling Lankenau/Main Line Health, I was quickly connected to the actual physician's office and my request for information or an appointment was met with (for the most part) friendly and helpful people. 

Example: I called PM to get an appointment for something requiring immediate attention. After sitting on hold on the 800 number, then sitting on hold for the actual doctors office, I was made to recite a tedious list of information to prove that I was, indeed, myself. Then I'm interrogated about my insurance. Finally we get to the business at hand. I'm put on a long hold only to be told that the ""first available appointment is 2 months away.

Then I called Lankenau. I spoke to the woman in the doctors office, who was friendly, interested in helping, and could ""move things around"" in order to get me in within two business days. 

I understand we're in the middle of a pandemic. I get it. But that doesn't give these poor excuse for health care employees license to behave so very badly. And it's not just once or twice (everyone has a bad day now & then). It's been consistent over years. 

Penn Medicine, is anyone even interested in making this better? My complaints have gone ignored and unanswered. You need to take a hard look at the way your employees are dragging down your business and your reputation. I moved my doctors over to Lankenau and am no longer stressed out trying to do a simple thing like make an appointment.",2021-01-08 15:03:14,496,2494,

I immediately texted my friends to plan a date to try out the first and only Uzbek restaurant in Nashville. We were welcomed when we walked in and offered to sit wherever we'd like. 

They were following all COVID-19 protocols and 1/2 of the tables and booths were blocked off. 

My friends and I love to order various dishes and share. They brought out some warm pita for us with a cream cheese/sour cream like white dip sprinkled with paprika. Then we got to ordering. We started with the Chuchvara which is a fried meat dumpling with onion and spices served with a salsa like sauce that had a kick which I love. My friend who doesn't really do spicy still enjoyed it. It was perfectly fried and not greasy. I wish I was eating some while writing this. One order comes with four and let's just say we were all being polite about eating the last one. ;) 

Then we ordered the Pelmeni soup. It's made with homemade meat dumplings in clear broth served with homemade yogurt. With the cold weather, this was absolutely perfect. I could have eaten this all by myself. The dish is really shallow so a little harder to share with the broth but the dumplings were soft, chewy, and tasty. 

Our main was Osh which is the most traditional Uzbek dish of rice pilaf with braised lamb, carrots and spices. They served it with homemade yogurt and Achichuk salad which is sliced tomatoes and onions seasoned with spices and basil. The rice pilaf was a little greasy for me and the lamb wasn't as flavorful as I was hoping but the dish was still good. The star was the Achichuk salad side. It's the perfect compliment to the rice pilaf with it's bright flavor.

For dessert, we had kunefe which is thin layers of rolled pastry, shredded & baked with cheese topped with crushed pistachios. We loved this dessert because it wasn't too sweet, crunchy, and flaky. 

The chef came out to see how we had enjoyed our meal and our waitress was attentive and so nice! 

We were shocked that we had the entire restaurant to ourselves and hoping that it's because they are new and people don't know about them yet. Please go and support them! The food was unique and delicious. I can't wait to go back and try several other items on the menu that I've never had before like Uzbek bread and Norin.",2021-01-17 16:55:24,483,2366,

First of all, the vibe of the place was very chill, almost a little bit Jamaican with some of the artifacts that they had on the wall.  I would say its more casual and not really a fancy place - but still funky and cool.  As far as cleanliness, when we came in they sat us in a table far away from others which was nice.  I dont know if they are monitoring their capacity, but it did seem like the other tables with guests were spaced apart.  

Anyways, the best part of this place was the food - and also the drinks!  We ordered the Kottu Roti and the Rico.  They both were good BUT if you are trying to decide between the two - go for the Kottu Roti if you like spicy indian flavors!   What I liked most about the Kottu Roti was that it is a unique meal that you will not find anywhere else.  You can get a burger anywhere but you cannot find this dish unless you are at Carmo.   

Both the dishes that we got were vegan.  They have a ton of vegan and vegetarian options here!  Its a great place to take a group of people because they have both non-veg and veg.  

Another favorite from here were the drinks.  I liked their drinks because they used fresh fruit in mine.  I got the La Paloma which had fresh grapefruit in it! I would recommend this place to a friend AND I would go here again if I came back to NOLA!",2021-01-11 21:47:30,312,1461,

Definitely  a great girls night , date night, bday dinner  restaurant. My  favorite dish of the night was the warm goat cheese. Right amount of acid and saltiness from the olives soo good. I shared this dish with my friend I came with  and actually considered ordering  a 2nd, that's how good it was. We asked for extra bread so we could sop up every ounce. Brussels I'd give 3.5/5. Could have been pretty good   but a lot of the brussels  weren't charred.  It doesn't matter how much cheese and bacon a Brussels dish has,  the number one downfall of any brussel sprout dish is  having uncharred and not crispy brussels. I was kinda disappointed because my friend hates Brussels  sprouts as most people do until you have a charred crispy brusssel (I.e myself) . I tried  to to convince her to give brussel sprouts another shot in her adult live  and to  not fear brussels like the ones in her childhood that were probably boiled or steamed and tasteless . I steered her right though  and picked out only the most charred ones for her and didn't eat the rest that were mostly green/ white, which left her convinced to try more crispy Brussels at other restaurants! I feel like I would order this again because come on... parmesan and crispy prosciutto ! I would specify I like it when the Brussels are  charred and crispy. 

Ordered the calamari and it was kinda meh and bland. Like the batter needed some seasoning or even just  salt maybe. Wouldn't order it here again. We both agreed there wasn't much flavor or any kinda taste.  We shared the gnudi pasta, which is like gnocchi like soft dumplings. We both loved that. Felt that it was  not dense  and  so light, smooth and pillowy . The cream based sauce with pistachio oil was great pairing too. For dessert  we took  the server recommendation to get the caramel  apple crisp. Taste  reminded me of a  firmer bread pudding. It was delicious. Also had an espresso martini which was well made. We both got white and red Italian wines but don't recall which ones. I just remember the red was our favorite, not too dry yet not sweet and would definitely get again.

On 12/4/20, I and MW visited Coyne's in Eagle. We were meeting for a late lunch/early dinner but decided to order off the Happy Hour menu, which has some of their most popular dishes. We also shared a dessert.

Chicken Gumbo - Peanut butter roux, Cajun chicken with andouille sausage, okra and jasmine rice ($3). This was our favorite appetizer. It had a good flavor and generous chunks of chicken. I would order it again.

Flautas Poblano- Rotisserie chicken, Oaxaca cheese, fried flour tortillas, roasted chili cream, scallions and cilantro ($6). I expected this to be my favorite appetizer but it was my second favorite. I don't know that I would order it again though. The presentation is lovely but I've never had a poblano dish that had so little flavor. This would be a great dish for your friend who thinks they like Mexican food but afraid of anything that has the barest hint of spice or heat. 

Brisket Tacos - Four smoked brisket street tacos with guacamole, lettuce, pico de gallo and cojita ($6). We ordered this dish so we could try the brisket and the guacamole. We weren't impressed with either.

Curry Lettuce Wraps - Butter lettuce, rotisserie chicken, curry dressing, green apple and chow mein noodles ($5). This was MW's second favorite appetizer. I think the flavor combo is interesting but it would be better if it didn't have the splash of Sriracha on top. A little bit of Sriracha goes a long way and quickly overpowers the dish. I suggest you remove most of it. This issue could be remedied by the cook mixing Sriracha with sour cream and drizzling a Sriracha Crema on top.

Brown Butter Pound Cake - Bourbon salted caramel, candied bacon ($10). This is the restaurant signature dessert. Caramel is not my personal favorite but if you want a dessert that packs an explosion of flavor, this is it. We both enjoyed this unique dessert.

I would be willing to go back and give Coyne's another try, this time ordering something off of the regular lunch or dinner menu, but there are a lot of other new restaurants that I am eager to check out first, as well as restaurants I have already visited that I would prioritize over revisiting Coyne's.",2021-01-29 03:16:17,449,2175,

The rumors are true, they do up charge for credit cards. Read about it before hand, went into the store and didn't see any signs indicating a credit card fee. Wasn't offered a receipt (probably because they know people would be upset about the different charge to their credit card). Not terribly upset about it because I figured that was the case based on the reviews and while some places do charge a credit card fee, they generally disclose the charge... since you know.... it's 2020 and credit cards are common. The up charge was 8.75% which is egregious, guess it offsets their 10% slice app discount but again I figured something like this was the case. (See Bella, technically, 6% of that up charge was to pay sales tax which isn't charged when given the original price at the register, if I didn't mention this, people may think you up charge 8.75% on top of the sales tax... you see how a lack of disclosure could be deceptive???) Disclose your credit card charges of 2.75% to your local patrons and everyone would probably feel more fairly treated.

Cheesesteak - (Beef) - Bland and bread was nothing special. Fried onions were cooked well. 6.3/10.

He was a delightful, professional, and prompt in the matters that were within his realm of control. If the transaction would have ended there this review would have been 5 stars and 2 thumbs up, however it didn't. Earlier this month, I went in to purchase a vehicle for my business, had a guarantor, proof of income, active on sunbiz etc. Filled out the paperwork on terms that I felt was fair. Took a picture with the bow on the vehicle, took delivery of the vehicle and was on my way. After a week or so I get a quite alarming message from Waseam Khalif a financing manager. Stating I need to come in. As with business and personal affairs I truly believe my time is valuable. No need to sugarcoat and no need to waste daylight. The message that was sent was eerily vague. He stated there was an ""issue with the paperwork"". Fast forward with my work day I get another message from Waseam that states  ""I was just informed by my boss for you to just bring us the car back today!"" I politely asked for a copy of the paperwork to be sent to the email that was on file so my lawyer and I can take a look at it. This gives me an opportunity to review the paperwork at a convenient time and not under pressure of the financing department and car salesman. Waseam then proceeds to tell me ""there isn't anything to send you"". At this point in time red flags are going off I mean after all why would I be coming back if I was not going to sign additional paperwork? To add insult to injury the next day I get a message informing me that if ""I do not stop by today or tomorrow we will have to report the vehicle stolen."" As a fairly knowledgeable individual Im aware that consumers have rights just as dealers do. If you are unaware of your rights I implore you to take a look at them so you can ensure you're being treated fairly. This is a textbook definition of ""spot delivery"" or also know as ""yo-yo"" financing. Spot delivery is Anticipatory Theft. Furthermore it violates the Truth in Lending Act. What dealerships will not openly disclose with you is that dealerships are the first creditors and the ""banks"" are third parties. So the expression ""the bank deal fell through"" or whatever erroneous jargon is utilized is not necessarily true. It simply means the third party banks did not want to take on the conditions of loan that were explicitly expressed In your purchase agreement. The dealership(creditor) can and has or else they wouldn't be contracting it out to a third party. When you understand that car dealerships are in the business of selling cars and not necessarily financing a lot of the tactics utilized make perfectly good sense. Lastly,please ensure you do your research. Know your rights as a consumer, and if you are being treated unfairly due to the unscrupulous and greedy financing managers know that you can fill out a report on the Federal Trade Commission. Hope this helps save someone time, and heartache in the second largest investment most individuals make. If there was an ""issue with the paperwork"" where I as a consumer made a mistake would there be any leniency?  The answer to that is absolutely not, with that being said when people reveal their true colors believe them the first time.

2220 Airline Drive, Kenner, LA 70062
Clark W. Dennis

I have repair insurance on my 2010 Ford pickup. It came with the purchase. 
The truck leaked power steering fluid during a recent trip, and after calling around to the area repair centers who are listed as accepting this insurance, I took it to Dennis Automotive on Airline Drive in Kenner. They told me there would be a 2-day wait for the diagnostic and then the repair. 
I left the truck parked in a slot off the street at the front of their building and went into the office with the insurance paperwork. Two days later, I returned to the facility to inquire - seeing the truck still parked exactly where I left it, I had my doubts. I was right; they reported that nothing had been done as yet. 2 days later, same thing. And 2 days later, same thing. No, not a phone call - an office visits each time. I never heard from Dennis Automotive unless I visited their offices.
At every conversation, on the phone or in person, Clark Dennis kept pointing out how very busy they were with their CarMax service agreement and had no time to work on my vehicle. All said without any apology nor acknowledgement of their delays
After a full 7 days of nothing being done, I drove my rental to their garage, and met with Mr. Dennis, the owner, Mark, the manager, all 4 mechanics who were in the office, plus the clerk, and no one reported any work being done. They could not even find their own paperwork on my truck until the lady who did the office administration said, ""It's on the bottom of the pile."" (Literally!) I knew then exactly how important my vehicle was to them.
So, Dennis, confirming that no work had been done, gave me the truck key himself, and I drove home. On arrival at home, Dennis was on the phone to me demanding that I return - I replied no. He then said, ""We have money in your truck."" I replied with another simple, ""No"". He responded in a threatening manner,  ""Oh, so you are going to be a tough guy huh?"" (Yes this 75+ year old 5'9"" 175 lb. guy is going to be a ""tough guy""!) I hung up.
Later that day, after they were closed, I returned to pick up my rental car, which had now cost me $500! And to my amazement, 2 tires had been deflated. The rental had been disabled! What a classy bunch! 
They kept my truck for 7 days, and never diagnosed the problem.  I visited their office 3 times to try to encourage a diagnosis - the diagnosis required by the insurance! It was never provided. No one knew that work had been done on my truck. I did not steal the key - they gave it to me. And then Dennis treated me  like it was my doing - my fault - that he did not know that they had indeed worked on the truck - that's 6 people plus the clerk, and no one had any idea, until after I had left. And then they vandalized my rental.

One night, after putting off getting Chinese food for months, I finally gave in and ordered from Chef Li's through UberEats. Reasonably priced and arrived still hot, I was pleasantly surprised with what I got. I ordered the medium spice (recommended on UberEats) Orange Chicken combo with white rice (pictured) and two egg rolls (not pictured). The egg rolls were everything I needed and are always a make or break factor for me, i don't know that I would have changed anything about them. Solid, classic, and decently sized for the price. The medium spice level on the orange chicken equates to not being spicy at all, but not sweet. I have a good spice tolerance, but didn't pick anything up at all. I expect that the spiciest level may actually have a kick, but the flavor was nice and not overly sweet. Upon reheating on my stove, the chicken was saucy enough to reheat really well for great leftovers! My biggest complaints fell into two different areas: The pieces of chicken were HUGE. This made it hard to cut through and eat since it is generally a crunchier shell on orange chicken, when reheating I had to cut each piece into about 4 pieces to make them closer to bite size. The other major complaint falls with communication from the businesses. They added charges without communicating why they were raising my price so I wasn't super stoked there. Overall, I'd probably see myself eating here in the future but will most likely poke around Tampa Bay to see if I can find anything better.",2021-01-19 18:32:11,337,1663,

The gulf shrimp tacos were the best item we ordered. The taste of these tacos were phenomenal!  Perfectly cooked and flavorful, with such juicy, jumbo shrimp too.  The corn tortillas we tried were fantastic!  However, they were regular sized (about the size of your hand), and not enormous as I might have expected for a $6 taco.  It's pricey for a taco.

The fresh catch burrito was also yum!  The size of the burrito was decent, but I was disappointed in the amount of fish it contained.  For $16 burrito, I didn't think they needed to skimp on the fish  :( 

Sadly, the crawfish quesadilla was mediocre. There seemed to be no seasoning on the crawfish.  It was almost like plainly sautéed crawfish and cheese stuck between tortillas. The refried beans were flavorless too, like it had come from a can. The Mexican rice was awesome in taste, but the portion was so small. Rice is such a cheap ingredient, I can't believe the tiny scoop that came with my quesadillas.  For $17, this was absolutely not worth it.

The worst part was that they charge an 18% ""packaging fee"" to pick up your order to-go. I think that's ridiculously high considering I'm driving to pick it up myself, and the food was not packaged especially beautifully or anything.

If you can't tell from the rest of my review, I think the prices were too high for the amount of food served, and the ""packaging fee"" just to pick up your order is ludicrous. This was too over-priced for a casual Mexican restaurant. For $60 worth of Mexican food between two people, I would expect to be really full with possibly some leftovers.

I also must confess that while I had heard of this place for the past few years, I never had the chance to go, since I lived on the other side of town, and did not think it was worth the half hour drive. 

Thankfully, fortune smiled upon me one morning, as I found myself in the area with a friend, and had the opportunity to try it for the first time. 

The menu is very basic, but if you want proof of its greatness, I would try the pancakes and french toast, both of which were creamy, and cooked perfectly. In addition to that, they make the bacon nice and crisp, with just a hint of char, just the way I like it. 

Customer service is great, plus they do offer takeout. 

The only drawback to this place surprisingly, are their cakes and pies, which boggled my mind. The first time I came here, we ordered a slice peach pie and a coconut cream pie, both of which tasted like they were a few days old.

So I went and found out that not only do they rake you over the coals in payments, everything else is done telemed through LV.

I literally for a 15 minute appointment was charged 97 dollars between myself and my insurance. They also wanted my entire deductible up front and they said they would give me back what money was covered by insurance. Keep in mind they knew that my deductible was also being used at this other crappy office. I noticed going into this place that they seem to turn and burn patients as quickly as possible.

I was hopeful that I could get a reservation, but knew that it may be a stretch as I was calling around 5pm that same day. I spoke with a gentlemen on the phone who had informed me that between 7-730 would work best, which was fine for us. We live down the street, so we made the trek to the restaurant to be there around 7pm. We stepped in and it wasn't super crowded, which was fine by us. We were quickly greeted and seated at a table nearby. Upon being seated, we were greeted by both the gentleman who took our call and our server. The waitress was extremely friendly, but definitely not knowledgeable about the wine menu. We asked for her recommendations and she was unable to provide that for us, as she stated that she hasn't tried the wines (That's ok!). We were so hungry, we decided to put an order in for caprese. Since there were 4 of us, we were hopeful it was enough for us to all get a bite of. Within a few minutes, the caprese was brought to our table and was a large portion! (SCORE!). We delved in and boy was it delicious. It is definitely worth trying and also a larger portion to be able to serve multiple people. 

For dinner, I ordered Ravioli di Aragosta e Granchio. Holy smokes! That is probably the best ravioli I have had in SO long. It was creamy, delicious, and the added shrimp/asparagus gave it even more flavor. My in-laws ordered penne alla vodka and cappellini primavera, which they both raved about. My fiance ordered the chicken parmesan, which I got to try, and was delicious as well. The food was warm and well presented on the plate. 

After dinner, we ordered some cappuccino and was given a slice of  cake from a birthday party nearby. The bus boy (owner's son) was SO friendly and nice. We loved having him collect our cutlery, because it gave us the feel of an actual family establishment.

The only complaint was that our waitress was actually kind of on her own time for things. She was absent a few times when we wanted refills and even forgot them at some point. Other than that, the entire experience was FANTASTIC! we will be back.",2021-01-04 17:59:32,458,2136,

For context, while I am not vegan (I love cheese too much) or vegetarian (despite multiple attempts) I am quite familiar with vegan dining, and find this to be the best spot l've tried in the area. In my opinion, the key to good vegetarian or vegan cuisine is creativity and bold flavors, which Cider Press does well.

In my experience, the key with this place, as with any vegan-esque restaurant is to manage expectations.  I see vegan dining as it's own cuisine, and set my expectations accordingly. I find that by judging vegan food based on how well it replicates a similar dish made with animal products, folks are often not as satisfied as when they approach vegan as a category of cuisine in and of itself.  

When Cider Press first opened there were a lot more raw items on the menu, which was part of the allure for me. It seems like they have tailored the menu more and more to be ""vegan lite"", and significantly reduced the number of raw items on the menu, which may have been to attract a wider base of customer.  This is the reason for 4, rather than 5 stars. Still a good spot, I just miss some particular items like the Vegan/Raw Florida roll!  

KEY TAKEAWAYS

- AMPLE OUTDOOR SEATING with umbrellas and great people watching on Central Avenue. 

- GREAT FOOD AND DRINKS - Some of my faves are:

--- the Vegan ""eggs"" Benedict, made with scrambled tofu, spinach, tomato, yummy biscuits, and a delicious gravy (see pic from today). 

--- Vegan Bang Bang Schrimp - Very tasty!  I have liked all of the schrimp dishes, as very flavorful except the Scrimp and Grits, as it was quite oily, so that's the only one I wouldn't recommend.  

-- all of the dished made with beyond meat (the best vegan meat substitute on the market, if you ask me).  I particularly like the Vegan Shepard's Pie. 

---Mother Kombucha on tap - This is by far my favorite brand of Kombucha and locally made - WIN/WIN. 

- GREAT STAFF - Always kind and professional. 

- COVID- All staff are wearing masks and regular menu is available via QR code only. Personally, I wouldn't sit inside as there isn't any cross ventilation or doors that can be propped open, but to each their own.",2021-01-02 18:34:32,472,2237,

I was told it was going to be in person and that I had to arrive 15 minutes prior to her appointment time.

I said okay and confirmed it for over the phone. I then called a third time to let them know to please call a different phone number for the appointment, not the listed number.

And without STL-Style, I wouldn't have been able to build the awesome wardrobe to promote my message. Most recently I supported not only STL-Style but also the Soulard Business Association by purchasing ""Soulard Strong"" shirts for my boyfriend and myself. The quality is so amazing! They're incredibly soft and fit perfectly and help us represent the spirit of our new neighborhood. 

Located at the westernmost throngs of the Cherokee business district, this locally owned shop is a must stop for anyone looking to add to their collection of St. Louis themed merchandise. They offer basically anything you can think of. Aside from the massive catalogue of tshirt designs offered, STL Stylehouse also offers everything from baby clothes to water bottles. I have purchased enough stickers, patches and buttons from them to cover the interior and exterior of my car. My absolute favorite is the FeminiSTL sticker. It's so well designed and I love the color choices. It was a great addition to my water bottle. 

Let's me just speak this into the universe... St. Louis has the best city flag in the United States of America. It's bold. It's classic. And OHLAWD that fleur de lis just GETS me. I'm a sucker for any product that has the St. Louis flag on it, and STL-Stlye is not afraid to put the flag on anything. They offer PPE masks with the St. Louis flag on it as well as key chains, shot glasses... ok ok you get it. It's on everything. And I'm obsessed. 

But kitschy gifts aren't their only specialty. You can also have your very own tshirt designs printed by STL-Style. No matter if you're having shirts printed for a family reunion or celebratory bar crawl, their prices are incredibly reasonable. The turnaround time on getting products personalized and printed varies in my experience, but they will meet any set deadline.

The cabinets and appliances are high quality (but not TOP quality).  The little things are done right.  For example, the sinks are sloped instead of flat so that water goes towards the drain instead of sitting on the sides.  The kitchen sink is deep.  My kitchen had lots of countertop space.  The closets are big and plentiful.  The shower heads are detachable if you want to use your own shower head.  Electrical outlets are placed in good positions.

NOISE: 
The materials used in the building's construction is not the cheap stuff that plagues many newer structures across the country.  What this means is that the walls are good at blocking most of the noise from your neighbors.  I lived next to a dog owner and I never heard barking noises, music or talking except from the hallway.  Unfortunately, the roof and floor let through a lot of noise.  The person who lived above me wore heeled shoes inside their apartment often and I could hear every footstep.  The person who lived below me also complained about my own footsteps.  ALSO, the building is located next to an industrial plant whose equipment makes loud noises at random times on any day of the year (including night time).  One great thing is that there is almost no traffic noise.  All of the streets that surround the building have very little traffic.  This means that you won't hear many sirens, loud cars, trucks, etc.

NEIGHBORS:
The building is near WashU and Barnes Jewish Hospital.  Many of the people who live here are wealthy Asian international students or nurses/doctors at the hospital.  You will see the medical workers coming home from work still dressed in their scrubs.  Do you want to ride the elevator with them?

Other nice things include the gym, which has a full squat rack and lots of equipment.  There is full-time security staff that patrols the community.  All entrances are locked or monitored by the security.  The parking area is secure.  There is a free coffee machine for the community and the lobby has some nice amenities.  The management also does try to host community events when possible, often with free food and drinks.  The management themselves are also very friendly and willing to help you out with any problems.",2021-01-05 03:43:12,488,2502,

On the first day we were set up for delivery and installation, we were notified by text that the time had been changed to 6-10 pm.   The trucking company that they use never showed and never called.  The following day, I called them and was given 2 different excuses why they never came (couldn't find the house and ran out of delivery time) but only an apology that we were never called.  They offered to reschedule for a day that did not work for us, they said they would call back to reschedule and never did.  I only got a text a day later saying they were coming the next morning (at the time I said did not work). I took that day off of work at the last minute anyway just to get this done.  They did show up as scheduled, however the delivery guys said they didn't know they were supposed to install it, so they did not have their tools.  They borrowed mine, but were face-timing someone asking how to make it work!  
Not only did they not get it installed completely, they scratched the cabinets!  That was 5 days ago and they STILL have not contacted me to install it properly. 
In the midst of all of this, I have been on multiple phone calls with Goedekers themselves and other than apologies, they have not made any effort to ensure this oven gets installed. I had to make several calls requesting to speak to a manager before one actually called me back.  I have had multiple promises made that have not been kept.  
On a positive note, everyone I have been in contact with has been very nice, but kindness is not getting my oven installed.   
I will NOT be recommending this company in the future. This is pathetic customer service.  
Ultimately, we gave up and installed it ourselves.  But Goedekers doesn't know that yet because they have not even contacted us to follow up.",2021-01-12 17:01:10,403,2004,

We arrived to drop our jeep off on Thursday, Dec 17, 2020 for our scheduled Friday install, they had no record of our appointment.  After waiting over 30 minutes, they finally said they'd install the next day and told to come back at 11am on Saturday to pick up the jeep and to bring out motorhome to be shown how to use the blue ox.  

Upon arrival for that appointment the jeep was not ready.  We were told it would be another hour.   We waited and waited, over 3 hours we waited.  There was zero concern by anyone that our jeep was not done or that we had to wait.  We do not live close, so it was not like we could go back home.   Finally our jeep was ready, but Reuven advised the locks and plugs were not in and that he would mail them to us the following week due to our having to wait so long for our jeep to be finished. 

 Now over a month later we still have not received the parts.   This is not a cheap product,  so the locks are rather vital for anti-theft.  The plugs just keep dirt out.  We have called, and Reuven said the locks came in and would be mailed, but still have not received them.  Now Reuven does not return our calls and gal in the office tells us the parts arrived in Phoenix.  

In our 3+ hour wait we talked to 2 other customers with same situation of poor scheduling and lack of concern by anyone at Quality Bumper.  

Will be disputing the credit card charge with our bank if no return call and no part's received by end of this week.   Not at all happy with service, scheduling, customer service and certainly not happy with failure to provide all parts we paid for and after sale customer service.  They are very disorganized and have absolutely no idea how to do appointment scheduling.",2021-01-26 05:09:18,391,1891,

Note I ate in the steakhouse part of the restaurant but can not find the bar part, since this restaurant is in a hotel not sure how to add it so I like most others am adding it here. I was staying at the Gaylord for New Years Eve and wanted to celebrate in style so I wisely made a reservation way in advance. It was a good thing as that evening there was no more reservations. Once we arrived we were greeted and led to our table. We got a nice table on the outside of the house. It's pretty nice to eat outside a house on New Year's Eve but still be inside the hotel. I had looked at the menu in advance to plan out what to order. They do specialize in steak but have a few other proteins to choose from. Our waiter was excellent throughout service and very attentive. Service was of the highest caliber but also it was New Years Eve so I am sure they called in the best staff to work. We ordered two of the porterhouse steaks, several sides ( Mac and cheese, carrots, and burgundy mushrooms. We were able to get the chocolate truffle cake for dessert for free as we were staying at the hotel and it was one of the perks from the hotels resort fees. The highlight to start was a great drink called tequila mockingbird. I could have drank more but limited myself to one as I knew it was going to be a long night. The steaks and sides were all brought out and prepared to our specifications. The porterhouses were 27 oz.. we split the two amongst three of us and that worked out well. Keep in mind the sides are great and large. I personally am not a huge fan of carrots but theres were unique and an heirloom variety. The Mac and cheese according to my kids was the best they had had and I can say they both have eaten a ton of this at a lot of different places. If I got it again I would add the crab, but my daughter doesn't like it that way. The mushrooms I. My mind make an excellent addition to the steak. Also they have several house made sauces. Hands down the in house steak sauce is phenomenal. The chocolate truffle cake was very good but at the end of the meal I was suffering from too much of a good thing. I really enjoyed my dinner and it was a great way to end the year. No",2021-01-29 03:37:27,478,2227,

I spoke with Charles Dossett, owner, at GatorBoys Moving several times prior to the move date and we texted several times as well. When speaking with him for the quote he was very helpful in answering questions I had about how the move would work & even the best way too pack certain items ....he came across as a nice guy and seemed legit. A few days before the move date GatorBoys Moving sent an email and requested an $800 deposit to be paid at least 48 hrs prior to the move, which sounded reasonable to me since they were bringing a truck &  guys for the move. I paid GatorBoys Moving $800 on Dec 16, 2020 and Mr. Dossett sent me an email with a heading that said ""GatorBoys Moving Long Distance Moving Contract"" that confirmed the move date and outlined what the move would entail naming the pick-up and drop off destination along with the Flat Rate cost, number of men for the move, plus the services and equipment provided for the move including dollies, moving blankets, shrink-wrap etc.

On Dec 20, 2020 Gatorboys was supposed to load up my furniture and boxes, however, Mr. Dossett contacted me by text to say he had staffing problems and initially he was going to get someone to my house for load-in later in the day on the 20th. When Mr. Dossett could not get a replacement for the 20th he apologized and said he would need to push the move to the 21st. He also said he would add a 3rd guy to help with the move at no extra cost. At that point we had texted back an forth quite a bit and I said I could understand his problem and the 21st would work.

On Dec 21, 2020 Charles and his men were supposed to be at my house at 8am, when they were 20 min late. I texted Charles asking for ETA ...Charles texted back saying they were in heavy traffic around the Marietta area of Atlanta, which was @ 45 min away from me ....after that they they COMPLETELY DROPPED OUT OF COMMUNICATION ....they NEVER showed up, they NEVER responded to my text asking where they were, and they NEVER answered my call. This was when I realized I had a really big  problem.

So there I was 4 days before Christmas ...left with all my belongings boxed up around me, my 2 dogs were medicated so they would be calm during all the moving activity and ready for the drive ....AND to top it all off I had a box of donuts I'd bought for the GatorBoys movers that never showed up! 

Five hours after GatorBoys Moving was supposed to be at my house it was pretty clear they weren't coming and I filed a complaint with BBB. The BBB contacted GatorBoys Moving with the complaint within the first 2 days  ....& to date there has been no response to me or BBB. 

On 12/21/20 after contacting BBB I then emailed Charles Dossett at GatorBoys Moving requesting a refund of my $800. Here is my exact email: 
""Charles, No one has showed up for my move, no one is answering the phone when I call, and no one is responding to my text, even thought you were supposed to be about an hour away at 9am this morning. You were supposed to be here at 8am and it is now 1:20pm so it appears you are not going to be showing up to move me. I am requesting a refund on my $800 deposit.""

In trying to recover my $800 I have contacted my bank and Venmo to report GatorBoys Moving. The bank can't do anything since the funds were already transferred through Venmo. I've been in continuing communication with Venmo and  the jury is out on what they can do. At the least, I hope they can shut down payment to GatorBoys Moving through Venmo because they are straight up using Venmo to commit theft. 

As of today Jan 15, 2021, I've never heard from GatorBoys Moving or Charles Dossett about my $800 deposit refund, and I'm  STILL reaching out to different resources to get advice on available options to recover my $800.",2021-01-15 15:36:06,814,3926,

I ordered pick up and arrived 15 minutes early than the expected finish time because I figured,""they're probably not crazy busy I'm sure it won't take that long."" When I arrived I was asked what I needed and responded that I put an order in for pick up and would like to pick it up. She quickly responded that they haven't had a tablet in months and never received my order. I was caught off guard and asked for assistance as in ""has this happened to anyone else? What should I do?"" She said maybe contact grub hub bc she has no way of refunding me handling the situation on her end. Totally fine and grub hub cleared up the confusion in about a 3 minutes phone call. I ordered the 3 mini burger meal w cheese and fries! I also finished my meal with an Oreo donut and 3 donut holes. This is your typical comfort diner food! Which is exactly what I was looking for!! The fries were fried fresh which I love and the burgers were just as fresh. The donuts were fairly light! Not so dense like Dunkin' Donuts by not crazy fluffy like Krispy Kreme. A very happy middle!!! 



Atmosphere is kind very old diner feel. Not much going on, pretty quiet. The woman is working alone and I think there's maybe one kitchen cook. I put my order in on the spot and waited maybe 20 minutes. The place has very cute decor just seems kind of out dated. I definitely wouldn't dine in as it's not my personal preference in dining.

IB is incredibly professional all around, from the front counter folks to the jewelry selection to the aftercare instructions. 

my second time at IB was for a daith and three lobes with brooke. the overall experience was lovely but after the fact i felt like a couple things weren't as great as I'd have liked. for one, brooke encouraged me to get a large daith ring, because she had a large one, which she proudly showed me. even though our styles were vastly different, i went with her suggestion (to please the authority with the sharp needle in her hand?) and chose a medium sized ring out of the three sizes she offered, but i know i would have gone with the small if i hadn't been persuaded. that gave me an icky feeling after the fact, like my piercing was more about her than me. also, i was bummed to not have had the funds for something yellow gold and titanium wasn't a look i coveted. and now it was huge. the lobe piercings were oddly spaced, but i didn't realize that until a few weeks later when i went to change my studs--two prong set czs and a gold bar. they looked horrible in a different configuration. i solved the problem by adding more piercings to balance the messy look. so that experience was not top notch. 

my latest experience at IB was for a tragus with andru. He rocked my world. Charlotte at the counter was also a love. andru is a true artist and talked me through everything, including negative space, as he picked the perfect placement for my stud. this, even after they both dashed my dreams of getting my Anti-Tragus pierced with a CBR. both my ear anatomy and my earring choice were wrong unfortunately, so i grieved for a minute and then welcomed a new tragus instead. 

i'm still giving IB five stars because brooke was a guest, and most people adore her, but moreso because my experience with anna, andru and the rest of the staff has been so great. 

additionally, if you're even still reading, i cannot stop ordering jewelry from IB. their selection is stupendous and even at times slightly lower priced than identical pieces from other online retailers. We're talking Buddha Jewelry, BVLA and the like. every order comes with a handwritten, hearty thank you from Noorann, the manager. I appreciate details like that.

First off, Mat's responsiveness and attentiveness to me as a client blew me away. After I was referred to Mat, I subsequently sent a draft of my PS and expected to wait about a week to hear back. But Mat provided feedback in less than 24 hours! It's clear that Mat tailors his approach to each client, as we then spent several hours over ad hoc video calls/phone calls addressing his specific feedback multiple times. This level of attention to me as a client, much less an anxious grad school applicant, put me at ease and really made me believe that my goal would be possible with Mat's help. 

Secondly, Mat has a great wealth of knowledge of the level of detail/types of experiences that admissions committees look for, despite the field. I applied to PA school - while Mat is a DPT by training, he was really able to help me hone my experiences in my PS to what was relevant, solid, and would optimize my chances. My issue in writing my PS was trying to include/do too much in too little space. Speaking with Mat, I picked his brain about the level of detail to go into, and bounced countless ideas off of him to craft the story I felt best about. 

I highly highly recommend Mat and his team of consultants at Health Grad Advantage. Right off the bat, you will feel cared for, listened to, and in great hands. With HGA's help, your goal (like mine) for grad school is within grasp!",2021-01-14 07:09:08,326,1569,

I (a disabled former RN whose boyfriend needs to drive me) go to this specific Starbucks 7 days a week and the majority of the time I just say my name at the drive thru and they say ""Hey heath just pull around we got ur order."" 
On Jan 10, 2020 I forgot my phone with my bday free drink on it and instead used my Starbucks credit card.  I figured I'll just bring my phone on the 11th for the free drink. 
On January 11,2020, they denied me using the coupon which was still on my Starbucks app with the redeem button still active. I told them that I simply forgot my phone, I'm a 7 day a week customer to the Warminster Starbucks and please honor the coupon. They said there was no possible way to acquiesce my request. 
Considering the amount of money I spend at this establishment, the fact that I was only 1 day late, and the excellent relationships I have with most of the employees, I was very upset that they wouldn't honor my simple request. 
If the 5-star employees who know me and my dog so well would have been working there on the 11th they would have taken care of me as one usually does to an extremely loyal long time customer. 
All other days this place would have gotten 5 stars, but it's one star for the 11th of January if that's how they would so easily dismiss a long time loyal customer.


On showing up to Starbucks Warminster on January 12, 2020, Jaime the manager apologized said she saw the review and completely took care of me today. I thanked her and we had a lovely exchange. This is the employees that make this place awesome. I was so surprised at how fast she saw the above review and when I showed up today at the ordering screen it was Jaime and she immediately told me to drive around and she would take care of the issue plus honor my bday drink tomorrow. I purposely go to this Starbucks 7 days a week because of people like Jaime, John, and all the other employees that know me by name and we always have  a brief exchange of pleasantries at the drive through counter.

I was like cool there is a Dunkin that is attached to a gas station. Super convenient. This isn't a review about the gas station portion but the pump I pulled up to was covered in duct tape. So I was like eh.... maybe I'll just use the Dunkin part of this place. 
So I went in. There was a guy at the window to the gas station portion that cannot help you with the Dunkin' portion. He is also incapable of finding anyone who can help you over there. The other time I stopped I knew to go right there and not even ask the gas guy. 
The attitude in there is a total complete IDGAF what you ordered, how it's made, whether I spill it when I give it to you..... nothing. 
Now I know working there probably sucks but at least a hey would be nice. 
Also there is just spilled things on the counter and floor. Not fresh spills. There was sugar and what looked like dried drinks. 

I now pass this one every day and it's not worth the convenience to me. I'd have to be pretty hard pressed to stop here again. There is a multitude of Them on my 20 minute way to work. It just sucks the first one I pass isn't an option. Especially since if I want gas and coffee it will require two stops now. I really hate gas station coffee.

There are businesses that you look forward to visiting but cell phone repair venues well ... you just hope they know what they are doing, are able to complete their work timely, and perhaps have prices below the price you think they are going to charge.

From my very first telephone call to UBREAKIFIX in Glassboro New Jersey through my saying goodbye as I walked out with my repaired cell phone I received nothing but superb, friendly, and professional service from the staff at this repair outlet.  

I should mention that they are a Google authorized repair shop, which is good news because if they weren't around I'd have to ship my phone to Google and wait for them to ship back to me. So I was doing a happy dance right from the beginning and if you've seen me do a happy dance well you won't find it on TikTok.

The shop itself gives the appearance of professionalism It's clean It almost reminds me of an optician's office. Although you cannot see the workshop you just feel comfortable and leaving your phone or tablet with their team.

They gave me an estimate on time and the job was completed in less than their estimate. Can't beat that!

And, As I type this review on my now repaired cell phone I could swear that the screen is clearer and easier to use than the original one that came with the phone. Of course that original screen went to the cement as I fell in a careless pile of my body Just because I thought I knew where the steps were and there really wasn't the step there so bam!

Finally, the cost was much less than I expected. My daughter had cracked her cell phone and she gave me the estimate for repairs. I walked away with more money available to be on my credit card than I expected and that made me one happy boy!

So, now I'm backed into the texting world and my cell phone is going every second of every day but if you happen to crack your screen and your anywhere in South Jersey I could not recommend a better place for your repair work to get done than this shop!",2021-01-28 15:31:45,438,2135,

We just saw that they were open when visiting Ulta this evening so we went in to try it since so close to home. They have Banhi Mi (Vietnamese sandwiches), pastries and teas. The place is bright, clean and spacious. Staff is friendly and greets you when you walk in. I do have to say that if I wasn't on keto that I would've totally gotten a chocolate croissant.  I may have to cheat to try soon. Hehe. 

Ok review on tea because that's what we want for.  They don't have almond milk so that right there limited my selection. So I ordered the Jasmine Green Tea unsweetened and no boba. My daughter got the milk tea with golden boba. Our teas were out super fast!  They are served in the cutest cups with red hearts. We love the Eiffel Tower and that's the design of this place and on the cups. I'm definitely saving my cup.  The teas were good -- a good alternative to our normal spot (you'll know if you see my other check ins and reviews) however does not even meet the level for me to ever think about coming here instead of my favorite tea spot.  The milk tea was good and sweet however the golden boba was not. It's very chewy with sort of a crunch to it. I'm not a fan. Next time my daughter said she's sticking to just the milk tea by itself and my go to will be the Jasmine since they don't offer almond milk alternative. 

Diet/keto recommendation:

Order anything but milk tea and ensure it's unsweetened. Only milk tea they serve here is with whole milk only.  And stay away from all the yummy sweet goodies they also have here. 

Wish they'd offer almond milk as alternative for people that cannot consume whole milk or are on diets and cannot consume whole milk. Then I can try the Matcha milk tea :)",2021-01-06 00:08:01,390,1809,

Then when I asked if they could fix it I get the run-around and I just keep getting stalled until I'm eventually told to take it elsewhere to have it diagnosed so they can figure it out easier.....now.....I understand that this is a common practice for bodyshops to do but only BY THE BODYSHOP!!!

Full version: Needed a last minute haircut for me and my son. Called in at 4:15pm on a Sunday and spoke to someone to confirm that walk-ins are accepted and to make sure that they will service us if we make it before closing (5pm). They said yes and I told them that we are on our way. I drove for 30 minutes and arrived at 4:45pm only to see a locked door. 

At first, I thought maybe I showed up at a wrong location by mistake (new to the area), double checked the address and confirmed that it was the right location and closing time on the door said 5pm. Then, I saw that a light was on in the back of the store and I saw a shadow of a person. So, I knocked on the door in attempt to get the employees' attention (I thought maybe it was some kind of mistake and they will come out and give us haircuts). 

Finally, someone came out (young lady with a lot of tatoos) and said that she was the store manager. She said I startled her when I knocked on the door ""because I was a man"" and I was ""knocking like the cops do"" and that she was alone and that's why she closed. I politely said that it was 15 minutes to 5pm and if the door was unlocked I wouldn't have to knock in the first place. I explained that we drove for a long time after calling in and checking to make sure that we will be serviced only to arrive at a locked door. She said that we should've showed up at least 20 minutes early because it takes time to get someone into the system (we're already in the ""system"") and said that the best that she can do is to give me 2 free haircut coupons (for new customers, which we aren't, and at that Lutz location, which I'm never going back to again). When we left, she proceeded to take photos of me and my underage son next to our car.

Needless to say, this was the worst haircut salon customer service experience I've ever had. I can't believe that a store/salon manager proceeded to close more than 15 minutes early than the advertised time, especially after someone called to confirm that they are coming, then refusing to service them. Wasted gas and over an hour of mine and my son's time. What a disappointment.",2021-01-18 02:43:30,530,2398,

I actually love staying at Spring Hill suites whenever I travel. But THIS Spring Hill made me so frustrated. We got to the hotel at 1pm. Hotel front door was locked. You know how they lock the door at night. And the only one that can enter is guest with their room key. Well, it was locked at 1pm. I flew all the way from Hawaii and we couldn't get into the hotel. Person the desk saw us standing there trying to figure out if the call button was working and just glared us down  almost as if she wanted us to pull out our room key, which we didn't have. Not once did she answer the call button. But after a minute or two of looking like COLD crazy people in 20degree cold, she opens the door. Still glaring at us.  I thought. Maybe this is their process. Maybe I picked a hotel in a bad area. (I didn't, because we stayed 2 more nights. And no other front seat worker did this! Until 11pm, as the sign on the wall says!)
Let's continue with this ""Event Specialist"" front desk woman... we get there and we misplaced our discount info that we printed. So we ask if we can use the business center really quick before checking in. She pints in the direction of the business center and turns around and rolls her eyes at another employee behind her. I figured, ok! It's our bad. We weren't ready, I'll take that! Another guest comes in, she hears the door open and she immediately stands up with a shocked face, after all. She locks the door MID DAY! Any who, that guest sounds like he's in a rush or just super duper cold like we were. He shockingly has the same issue, but tells her, can I email you my discount info?! And she says it's fine. All while I'm sitting right across from the checkin desk waiting for my husband to come back. And I'm so taken back by that. As she didn't offer that to us when we got there. Nor did we know that email was even an option. So I'm staring at her as she goes thru the quicker check in process I have ever seen at a hotel. **which is a plus! Because when I travel. I just want to shower and lay down for a few hours after a plane ride** I was super impressed at the check in process. But still upset at my first two interactions with her. We get our Print out code. She then checks us in quicker than ever and we go to our room. We settle in and about 20 mins later we get a call to our room. 
""Event Specialist"" is on the phone. So I tell her my husband is in the shower, can I help you?!  In the rudest tone I've ever been spoke to by a hotel staff all across America..  ""Yeah, I need a new code or you need to get out"" **oh, wait, I'm sorry? What does that mean? ""Mean, your paper code doesn't work? So I'm charging you the original rate or you need to get out"" **ok, can you slow down. I'm not understanding. (As she attempts to repeat herself for a 3rd time, I cut her off to tell her..) **I HEARD what you said, but can you explain better as to why you say my code doesn't work. It's in our email. It's what was given to us. (In a condescending voice) ""Just as I said, it doesn't work"". **Okay, RUDE, give me a few moments to call and find out why our code doesn't work, and I'll get right back to you... is that possible?! Giving us a few moments before kicking us out?!  ""Yup!"" (CLICK!!!). As I'm calling and emailing all at the same time. Cause, I have a kid trying to fall asleep on the new sofa beds they have, my husband is in the shower.. so I need this taken care of ASAP! Phone rings about 8 mins later. 8 mins of me freaking out l, feeling like a criminal. As if I tried to finagle a discounted room code of some sort and I've committed a major hotel crime. Anyway, ""Event specialist"" is on the phone... **Hello... ""It's taken care of.."" *EXCUSE ME! ""you're good to go"" **okay, well. I'm still on hold, so can you tell me why it's better now and not a few moments ago?! ""I called"" (CRICKETS, as I wait for a better explanation) **Called?! I'm confused. I'm still on hold. They're trying to figure out what's going on their end... ""We have a new system. I didn't check it. So I called and it's fine""  I wish I could use emojis for how mine blown I was after that phone call. I should've used my phone doe this review. I got No apology. Nothing.

The Fever have been in the WNBA since the first season in the year 2000. They are owned by Herb Simon and fall under the Pacers Sports & Entertainment umbrella. 

The Fever have qualified for the places in 13 of 20 seasons. In 2009, they went to the WNBA Finals but lost to Phoenix. They won the WNBA title in 2012 over the Minnesota Lynx. The legendary Tamika Catchings won the MVP that year. 

I was a season ticket holder for the first 2-3 years, though I'll admit I had my issues with Bankers Life Fieldhouse (then Conseco) due to accessibility issues. I finally gave up season tickets due to these concerns, but haven't and certainly won't give up following the Indiana Fever. Bankers Life does offer a lot in the way of disability accommodations, so despite my season ticket frustrations I wouldn't let that deter you from attending games. There's ample accessibility options and assistance available. 

The current head coach is Marianne Stanley.

While most people are familiar with Tamika Catchings, who is now the general manager after retiring, other legends include Katie Douglas and Tully Bevilaqua among others. Just this past season, Natalie Achonwa won the Dawn Staley Community Leadership Award. 

The Indiana Fever players are incredibly active in the community and in social justice efforts. I've never had a negative experience with any of the players and they go out of the way to advocate for basketball, the Fever, and for the community. 

Season ticket holders get a variety of perks. You can book the team's mascot (Freddy Fever), who has appeared at several events I've attended and is just awesome. There's a Jr. Fever Camp, an opportunity for ball kids, and a Hip-Hop Squad that performs at home games. You can even get a Game Night Greeting during a home game for a mere $50. That's amazing. 

These women, to me, are just amazing. They play incredible basketball, are amazing community ambassadors, and are pretty much without exception kind, compassionate, and incredibly intelligent women who represent Indy well. 

Truthfully, I'm a little amazed (and offended) that they've never been reviewed. If you've never been to an Indiana Fever game, you owe it to yourself to attend for sure. I've been to literally dozens of them and probably more than that!",2021-01-08 19:28:02,481,2450,

When I think about what has transpired over the last couple of days, I can't help but feel an overwhelming sense of disappointment. My family and I had such high hopes when we chose to make Greenleaf Waterstone a new place to call home. 

From the moment we stepped foot into the unit we immediately noticed the complete lack of care, cleanliness, time or effort that was put into preparing the unit for new tenants. For starters, the kitchen was a complete wreck. The cabinets are completely ruined and there was even a cabinet door missing. The microwave and refrigerator are old, damaged and extremely dirty. It was very clear to my husband and I that there was no cleaning done before move in. The vents and ceiling fans were disgusting and covered in dust and dirt. The laminate flooring was full of dirt, rocks, and dust. My husband myself and my child have stepped on several nails, screws, and sharp metal objects in the carpet. Not to mention we also found splatters of a red blood looking substance all over the bathroom wall. Considering that we are in the middle of a global pandemic, cleanliness should have been a PRIORITY and sadly this was not the case.  

The negligence on behalf of the Greenleaf Waterstone team is something I can't quite fathom. Being a renter/tenant for many years now, I can honestly say without a doubt that this is the most negative experience I've had thus far. 

With that being said, it is my hope that moving forward these issues be addressed and resolved to the standards that are outlined/advertised by the Greenleaf Waterstone team. My family and I want nothing more than a peaceful, comfortable, and habitable place to call home during our time here.",2021-01-03 04:09:27,336,1729,

I've visited this Starbucks several, many, beaucoup times before and I'm not sure how I didn't write a review, but here goes nothing...

Just to save time, I ordered ahead, using the app, I love this order ahead feature... I love, love, love this feature. I was using it before Covid-19. I love it, I  really, really do; do you think I love it? You're right, I do. 

I ordered a Venti green tea Matcha Frappuccino with coconut milk please, because your girl is lactose intolerant, but I still wanna get my matcha on, so there you have it coconut milk it is. I don't like that they up charge you $.60 for coconut milk, I mean don't charge me because I have a genetic in-deficiency, hello. At any rate...

I entered the facility and per City of NOLA Covid regulations, I had my mask on. I walked to the counter to pick up my drink, they verified me, I picked up my drink & I proceeded to leave. 

The barista's hold the drinks behind the counter because I believe there's been some issues with folks doing a 'snatch & grab' of drinks they didn't order or pay for. It's all good for me, no hassle that just reassures me that my drink is super fresh and hasn't been tampered with; DON'T SLIP ME NO MICKIE'S. 

I tipped them on the app on my way out the door. I was happy, I received super fast service, the baristas were polite, they greeted me as I entered & asked if I wanted a straw: CLASSIC STARBUCKS BEHAVIOR. 

Annnnnndddddd my drink tasted exactly as it should, coconut milk and all... I was very pleased about this because I ordered a Venti so there was lots of DRINK to be DRUNK. 

Clean facilities, inside & outside. I was able to do my normal stick and move caper... I was in & I was outta there in a jiffy.

Their sales manager, Michael Armstrong, is a liar, raised his voice to my girlfriend and myself, and even took off his mask while we were in the same confined room as him.  This kind of unprofessionalism and neglect to our lives is incredibly disrespectful.  The other (non-John Kennedy) Mazda dealerships in the area offer significantly better prices and better customer service.  Don't waste your time. 

TLDR version of my story (too long to post here) - Requested an out the door price for a car.  Were provided a number.  Double checked that number and verbatim said ""This is the out the door price, right?  Taxes, fees, etc all included?""  Came back the next day to buy the car at the agreed upon price and verified one more time on the price and details.  Went into financing to do paperwork.  After 2+ hours, we are about the sign the final piece of paper when I notice a number that is $5,500 higher than what we agreed upon.  Sales manager came in and raised his voice that it is the number we agreed upon and we are wrong, even condescending us.  Takes off his mask while in the same, closed door, small office space and continued to raise his voice.  We walked out on the deal and bought our car from a different dealership.  Second dealership was much more professional and valued our health and wellbeing. 

I highly advise against anyone from buying a car here.  Their sales manager is a liar, he is disrespectful, and he has no regard for your wellbeing as he took off his mask while raising his voice in a confined indoor area.

First let's start with Friday 1/22/21, my daughter dropped off red small mylar letters spelling out ""ROBLOX"" and a bag of 24 latex balloons to inflate. We were told each letter would be $2 each and the bag $3. My daughter realize after she left the store that she just paid $3 for each latex. I immediately called the store and asked the lady not to inflate the latex ones because that's too much money. She informed me that we cannot cancel the order because she turned down some orders in order to have ours blown up. Which was a lie, my daughter was the only customer in the store. I told the lady for the price you charged for these balloons we can buy 2 helium tanks. She said I told your daughter what the price would be and said have a good day and hung up the phone on me. Which is FN rude. Saturday my daughter in-law went to pick up the balloons between 1 & 1:30pm, she was handed a blue bag tied tight and a bundle of the latex. She asked the lady to hold the bundle so she could look at the lettered balloons. When she opened the bag the letter ""R and ""O"" was deflated. My daughter in-law asked what happened the lady tried to blame it on the quality of the balloons and that she tried to save them. She had the nerve to put some type of glue on the ""O"". My daughter in-law told her she need to replace them the lady said she do not have red. So what color do you have the lady replies gold and silver. So gold was chosen, the lady rang up $30 for replacing the balloons my daughter in-law told her we not paying for them you destroyed our property so you have to replace them. This lady had the audacity to call the police and tell them my daughter in-law told her she was going to kill her. (What a joke...LOL) When I arrived the police were still there waiting for me. I informed them I would like to file a report against this store. We were told this is not the 1st time they had issues at this store. Knowing that these balloons were for a child's party this lady could've been a bit more accommodating than rude. If we would've read the reviews we would have not patronized this store. Their responses to negative reviews are even negative comments. One comment they made to a comment they called the person mental. The good reviews MUST be from friends and family. In this store no customer is right...by this lady. My daughter in-law laid the balloons on the counter to take pictures. This is what they looked like before she left the store. The picture of the yellow balloon was taken when we arrived home, see time photo was taken (2:04 pm). The letter ""O"" she put glue on and inside where you would inflate the balloon. See photo. WE WILL NEVER NEVER NEVER EVER IN A MILLION YEARS PATRONIZE THIS STORE AGAIN!!!!! Overpriced items, mean miserable lady. A dog gets better treatment than how we were treated at this place. DO NOT spend your money at Tycoon Balloon take the drive to Party City. Trust me.",2021-01-30 01:08:27,654,3036,

I checked my order because we had a ""special"" burger. It was made wrong. So I decided to check the bacon avocado one too; had no avocado. They gave me back the first burger and it was made wrong again (we just wanted meat, tomato and lettuce). So then whom I thought was manager of shift supervisor comes to window. Tells me that they repeated my order and I said yes and that they said it like I told them (however, I'm assuming she put no lettuce and no tomato) I told him that if it didn't have cheese I'd take it like it was but my BF CANNOT eat cheese. So he apologizes. Brings me another one and it has cheese again! Plus they have not given me the bacon avocado burger back yet. Then I proceed to tell him that my banana splits are probably melted now. By this time they had already given me a free vanilla cup. He tells me to wait in the front that they are redoing the two burgers again. He comes out with two new new banana splits, two burgers that are now made correctly and $10 back . We start talking and he tells me he is partial owner and really sorry. I understand, they are new, line down the street and he was very apologetic and tried to fix order. My son who is 9 even tells him that they have nice customer service. Well by the time I got home fries and zucchini were cold, chicken strips and one burger that was made correctly in the first place was cold too. The sodas were altered down and the ice creams (2 first banana splits) were melted and all over bag because they didn't have correct lids on them and opened and made a mess. 
Food was good but not worth wait for two hours nor one. We will go back when wait is less than 30 minutes. In my opinion they should of made my entire order fresh including drinks.  Best of luck to them. Food was good, customer service was very good. Hopefully when we go back he will remember he promised my little  a free meal.",2021-01-23 02:09:50,434,1966,

We didn't know what to expect, beyond: ""hey, you wanna try that new Italian place up on 82nd St.?""

White linen tablecloths.
Impeccable table service.
Cloth napkins, heavy silverware.

OK, I know enough Italian words to know how to order, but I didn't expect lunch to be so, what's the word?... ""superb"".

Appetizers: Caprise Salad for me, Eggplant Parm for her. It's January, so I'm going to forgive the unripe tomato, that can't be helped. The mozz was fresh, and so was the basil leaf. 3 nice slices of each. Her eggplant parm was perfect, hot and melty and still firm, standing up about 3"" tall. Very nice portion.

I chose the fettuccine and filet. I expected to need a knife, but it came in a delicious Chiante brown sauce with mushrooms and bite size pieces of filet, again - a generous portion, but not too much I couldn't finish it. I wanted to lick the plate. Fresh ground Parmesan cheese with a spoon comes with it. 

My wife ordered spaghetti alle vongole. The briny juices from the clams, salty and tender, the pasta cooked just right, I could tell from watching her it was just as good as it looked. 

We finished it off with two expert cappuccinos, nice and frothy, and a slice of coconut cake with apricot filling.

If you're adding up the cost in your head, don't. Yeah, that was an unusually expensive lunch, especially for us. But we walked out of there feeling like we got more than our money's worth. We got a tour of Italy at a bargain price.

Nothing else including properly clean the vehicles.  The inside of the vehicles are disgusting they don't clean other then a quick vacuum.  See pics 

As with all Carmax dealerships the no haggle is just a gimmick all it means is you're going to pay top dollar for whatever price they feel like charging you based on the day.  No haggle means you idiot you must pay us whatever we want.  You're dropping tens of thousands of dollars you should be getting coffee and snacks for free at a minimum.  This is the cheapest company around don't believe everything your sales people tell you these are entry-level sales people because they are paid nearly nothing for sale of a car About 175 per vehicle so you don't get experience from these first time sales people.  One guy told me have the hybrids are really not saving me any gas that was actually 100% wrong.

If you don't mind paying top dollar and you don't want to shop around I guess this place is fairly easy but be careful because if you're buying a late model vehicle used, more than likely you can buy a brand new one with discounts at the same price at the dealer.  The other day I saw a Honda more expensive than a brand new 2021 model and this was a 2020 used.  Also look very carefully at the door jam you'll see a 2016 model will likely be made a year earlier in 2015.  You Should Not pay extra for a 2016 refuse to pay that price their advertising the car year older.  About half the cars there I found we're actually a almost year older than advertised date look in the door jam for the manufacture date do not pay extra for a car that's a year older than advertised on the window sticker even if it's the later model bottom line it's still a-year-older than advertised.

When we got there they told us it was a 20 minute wait. We ended up waiting over one hour. The bad part was that our husbands had to go to work and we were already short on time. We tried to get there early enough but now we were really late. We sat patiently and waited to be seated. When we were finally seated it took them 20 minutes to even ask us for our drink order. I have to say that it looked like they were understaffed. The manager Robert was even cleaning tables.  I have to say I have the most respect for a manager that get down and dirty with his staff. That says a lot for a manager.  Any manager that goes in and does the work instead of barking orders. Is an incredible manager. Well he didn't just stop there. He saw we still hadn't been tended to and came over. I explained that it was my birthday and that our husbands had to go to work. Once again he sprinted into action and took care of us.  They were able to make it to work only ten minutes late and our meal was fabulous. We had a beautiful waitress that was quite intricate.  She was accurate with everything and did not write anything down. She was so quick and accurate with everything. She was so polite.  She really made a bad situation into a beautiful evening.

They tease you on your way in by perfectly displaying the beautiful sweet treats within a glass counter! No one can resist. Along with the korean cauliflower this time I ordered the loaded mashed potato tots. So interesting! They come with a dipping cheese and sour cream.

In addition to wonderful food, social distancing is enforced. It appears they don't fill the restaurant to capacity. Every other table is vacant. They've placed plexiglass dividers at each booth as well as making masks mandatory. Servers wear masks. I don't remember if I saw gloves on the servers. And I also don't recall seeing hand sanitizer, but that doesn't mean they don't have it somewhere. I usually just being my own. 

We had great service. Our waiter was tentative, bringing refills the moment our glasses were empty. He greeted us promptly, checked in often, brought everything in a timely manner, our food was all correct and beautifully presented as well as prepared perfectly.

The day of the appointment he was not here on time so I messaged him and he told me that unfortunately he was having a problem with his equipment. It wouldn't be out of the shop in time and could we reschedule. While I wish he would've let me know before the appointment I said yes and he offered us a discount for our trouble. When he did come out and detail the Jeep he did a great job and we tipped him above the estimated price and left a positive review here. 
We made an appointment to have another car detailed. 25 minutes before the appointment he messaged to say unfortunately we'd have to reschedule because of the weather (fair enough but it would've been nice to know a bit sooner because the weather didn't start just then). 
Yesterday he was supposed to be here at 10. A half hour before I messaged to ask if he needed the address again or if he still had it. No response. 5 minutes after our appointment time I called him and left a message asking if he needed the address. A couple of minutes later I got a text that unfortunately he couldn't come because his employee had Covid and he was waiting on his test. I said I was sorry they weren't well, wished I could've gotten a heads up so we could make other arrangements and I hoped they both felt better soon. No response. While I'm hopeful they are healthy soon, my gut tells me they knew prior to 10 minutes AFTER our scheduled appointment that they would not be able to make it due to illness based on our past experience.

I called ahead to make sure the promotion was still going on, since this location is 25 minutes away from me. The employee who answered the phone said yes, so I hopped in the car.
 I was told that it would be a few minutes to prepare my food order, and asked if I'd like to order a beer while I wait. (Of course I would!) 
Everything on tap looked amazing. I chose the Ghost IPA because it was only 5.5% and I hadn't had much to eat yet that day. Ohhh, it tasted so good from the tap! We're still not ""going out"" yet, so all of my beers have been from cans/bottles and growlers for almost a year. Ghost is a beautifully clear beer with fruity undertones and tastes like summer. In fact, I enjoyed it so much that I went ahead and asked her to fill my growler so I could continue to enjoy this summertime flavor this week.
Kate, my server, was super down to earth and very engaging. I had such a lovely time chatting with her while I enjoyed my beer! I had to wrap up our conversation though and head home, because I had two hungry guys here waiting on their food.
We ordered two tempeh and one Asian saugage varieties. I had the tempeh one. The blalance between the creamy avocado pate and pickled veggies was really nice. Also, I was happy to see that the egg was in one chunk, not several, because in a sandwich this size, multiple chunks could just keep falling out on my lap. Such a first world problem, but still... The tempeh was a really pleasing consistency. It was al dente and not too soft. And lastly, those jalapenos. So hot! And that's what makes a banh mi in my opinion. It was delicious.
Thank you for putting together a breakfast that dragged me out of the house on a Sunday. We're not ""breakfast out"" people. In our house, Sundays are made for cooking in the kitchen. So this was a really welcome change.",2021-01-22 15:40:20,420,1912,

In October of 2019 I purchased a certified pre-owned vehicle here.  I was hesitant to use this dealership after reading several reviews about experiences female buyers had at this location.  After looking in the Philadelphia area and having a terrible experience with the dealership there, I decided to make the drive to Jeff D'Ambrosia.  They were very organized - ready for my arrival and the car I was there to test drive was ready to go.  I ended up purchasing the vehicle.  Months later I found that the rear seatbelt was not functional and that the tool to remove the specialty wheel bolts was not included.  The dealer had sold me a ""CPO"" car without a functioning seat belt, and without a way to get the tires off.  It had come with the special wheel bolts that cannot be removed without the tire lock key.  This was all annoying and disappointing, but not the end of the world.  What was unacceptable was the total and complete lack of customer service after the sale from both Jeff D'Ambrosia and VW Corporate.  I contacted the dealership several times to get the issue corrected and got the run around.  First, I was told I'd get a call back from the person I bought the car from.  I never did.  When I called back, I was directed to the sales team, who then directed me to the service team, who then told me they couldn't help and I needed to talk to the sales team.  I got fed up and contacted VW corporate, who directed me back to the dealership.  I explained the dealership was non-responsive.  From VW Customer Care:

""The concerns you brought up with the wheel lock and safety belt at the time of purchase under the certified pre-owned (CPO) warranty, these would be something that a technician at the dealership would be able to address. As we rely on them to be our technical experts, they can look at the safety belt from a hands-on perspective to determine why it's not functioning and what the best recommendation for repairs would be.  As you expressed these were concerns missed at the time of the CPO inspection, we would encourage you to speak with your Sales Advocate or the Sales Manager as they would be able to provide more in-depth information on the CPO inspection performed and help provide any resolution.""

So I went back to the dealership and again got no help.  I called VW customer care again and they kept telling me that since it's a warranty issue I would need to go to a dealership.  I explained over and over again that these items were not broken after the time of purchase, the car was sold to me as a CPO vehicle with these issues so it should simply be corrected.  I explained that the team at Jeff D'Ambrosia was not helping, and they told me I could go to any dealership to get the issues fixed but they could not guarantee it would be covered under warranty.  I ended up fixing the seatbelt issue myself and getting the tire bolts changed out by a VW dealership in Staunton, VA (they were great and totally reasonable!).  They did it free of charge and although they said it was 100% the responsibility of the dealership I purchased the vehicle from, they said the paperwork would be too much of a pain and not to worry they would just eat the cost.  They did not approve of the customer service I had received at Jeff D'Ambrosia.

1 year later, the sunroof leaked and has caused water damage to the inside of the vehicle.  This is a known issue with VW vehicles, however the team at Jeff D'Ambrosia did replace the entire sunroof seal prior to selling the vehicle so it's disappointing it has lasted just over one year.  Of course it's an issue that will need to be resolved at a dealership, and I can tell you that I will not be going to Jeff D'Ambrosia.  The team seems to not stand by their work or their vehicles...and honestly it seems like I can say the same about VW corporate as well.

My experience has been that once Jeff D'Ambrosia makes a sale they wash their hands, even if they sell you a car that doesn't meet basic safety and CPO standards.  Two thumbs down.",2021-01-03 06:10:30,814,4081,

Well the first 2 times we went after Datz first opened we were excited to try something new and different. Lets be real, the menu is a decadant heart attack waiting to happen by sounds amazing!  And it was, twice.  After that it seemed as time went on the service got sparse and slow.  Last 2 times we ate there the food was either stone cold (not even warm) or barely room temperature.  We've had biscuits that could break a window it was so hard and when we sent it back, they simply microwaved it!!! WTH??!!  I'm not sure how this kitchen passes their inspections when it comes to food temperature.  Anyhow, The last time we got the Mac stuffed meatloaf.  We had ordered this on the first visit to Datz and recalled the large domed meatloaf filled full of rich cheesy mac n cheese...this time we got a lump of a dried out piece of hamburger meat with a scoop of mac n cheese on top of it...clearly not stuffed inside.  Very disappointed.  Cocktails--Ok, I tried two on different occasions, they were awful.  Thats being polite.  The ""bartenders"" need to measure the ingredients and follow the recipes, maybe than they will actually taste good.

Seems one thing Datz is doing that I like is, for the most part, they try to space apart tables.  They also have hand sanitizer on each table.

Datz, I see your reviews.  I waited until I tired multiple items on different days and I have to agree with the majority.  You're slipping on quality BIG TIME.
Please take these review seriously as we have all taken the time to write them in hopes that you will.

Thank You.",2021-01-07 03:59:40,353,1645,

I got there about 5 minutes early and walked in to find the place totally empty. I walked up to the girl at the desk and said Hi, I have an appointment at 1:15. With out hesitation she snapped at me No you don't, we don't have any appointments now. I was so startled by her rudeness it took me a moment to answer. I said that I had made the appointment online and showed her my confirmation. She then told me it wasn't in their system and I couldn't just make appointments last minute. It went on like this for several minutes and she also told me she ""moves people around during the day"" I have no idea if she meant customers or staff and that I would have to come back later if I wanted service. When I told her I guess I would just need to cancel she actually laughed and said well you don't have an appointment so you don't need to cancel. I was so shocked I just turned and left.

We didn't order any sushi, but more general American Asian type. 
We ordered spring rolls, fried gyozo, orange chicken (hot) and gluten-free pineapple fried rice, with chicken, no cashews. 

They actually listen and do the special request. So many places do things by rote, that it's so nice to get the changes needed in the final product. 

The spring rolls were excellent - best I've ever had. 
The fried gyozo was a disappointment. The dipping sauce was good, filling was excellent, but the dumplings are deep fried instead of pot sticker, so the edges are over cooked and extremely tasteless. 
The orange chicken was perfectly cooked, and perfectly spiced to my desired heat level. They have 5 levels - mild, medium, hot, Thai, Thai hot and my ""hot"" was wonderful. In minnesota, ""hot"" just doesn't seem to exist, so this was wonderful. 

My friend needs gluten-free, so we were happy to hear they offered gluten-free fried rice. They normally add cashews to their pineapple fried rice (which is pretty unusual), but did skip them per our request. The problem, unfortunately, with their gluten-free fried rice is that they just completely eliminate the soy sauce, rather than use a gluten-free soy sauce. So, the fried rice was a bit bland, but still completely edible. It also unexpectedly had extremely large broccoli florets added, which tasted fine, but were jarring in their size. The broccoli wasn't so large in my orange chicken, so it was a little strange to see them in the fried rice.",2021-01-07 15:37:14,313,1529,

I left multiple voice messages, and even contacted the parent company in June through their portal to try to find someone to talk to. No response. Finally, in July, I had Amex block their charges to my account. 

Now I find a charge on my Amex in January. Huh? I called them to again cancel my account, this time Andrew the GM answers and tells me their 'policy' is that I have to come in person to cancel or send a certified letter. Why ""in person""? so he can take a picture of me to prove I was there in person - that's creepy! Or certified letter? These are transparent efforts to put up obstacles to leaving. I haven't been in a grocery store since March, and it is my 'policy' to not walk in to businesses like this gym or the post office to hang out with a bunch of strangers when the pandemic is raging. It is peaking right now in AZ, but these guys don't care.

So, I go back to Amex to block them again and I find that they started charging me again in September! How's that when they were blocked? They changed the merchant ID so Amex wouldn't recognize it and started hitting my account again. I have now disputed those charges and blocked them again. If they hit my account again, I will be reporting them for fraud.

First off, I'm at GL very often for their crowd favorite Taco Tuesday but the last time I went was easily my worst time there. We sat outside underneath the tenth where they have more tables for social distancing but I've never sat outside during all of the times I've gone here during covid and prior to. Underneath the tent they have a lovely dj who plays all of the best music. I'm not sure why they have this DJ outside because you can't even stand up at your own table and do a nice little sway or dance. Our waitress Milan was the sweetest person ever and kept checking on us and was very attentive in spite of her being new. it was her rude counter part Natalia that took us over the edge. Natalia rudely yelled at us ONE time to sit down and not dance because they could get in trouble with the city if they drove by. We also saw her go over to another table of minorities and address them but she never went to the table full of white girls which rubbed me the wrong way because I myself am an African American male and my friends that I was with that evening are also that of African American decent so it comes off a bit racist. After we asked Natalia for her manager (I think it was Ryan)  because her approach and delivery was terrible, he then takes her side and says ""Natalia is great. I never get any complaints about her. Weren't you guys apart of the group that called her the b word last week??"" I was so offended and appalled because he probably thought of some random table of black people to compare us to and that's not even in our character to act like that. We also asked him what's the point of having a DJ if you don't want people to dance and he couldn't come up with one reason to justify it because any human person is going to dance to good music. Ryan was one of the worst managers I've dealt with in food service and he said he would talk to Natalia at the end of the night even though we insisted he speak with her now so that she doesn't address another table the way she did ours. I was so disappointed and upset that I hope that I never have to deal with this manager again the next time I go if I do return. Natalia and Ryan do not deserve to be at such an amazing establishment like Green Lemon with their terrible customer service and bad attitudes.",2021-01-14 04:27:59,487,2314,

I'd gutted the interior & rebuilt the inner doors for the truck's 20th birthday, so figured some quick research would fix it.  A new door check replacement I ordered from my local Sierra Vista Toyota stopped the popping, but figured I'd like a body shop to help the door close easily & get the rattle out. 

I called late on a Tuesday to see if they were available the following holiday Monday.  There was a bit of discussion about them moving offices to the main dealership, but got booked for the Roger Road collision center on the date I was off from work.

After some confusion over which location a young man needed to take his new Tundra, Jane quickly took my clattering, stick shift, Taco to the back.  I'd just made it back from a bathroom break when Jane pulled the truck up to the front door.  I thought, ""oh no, parts need ordered...""  Jan calmed my fears, explaining Mike had noticed some of the upper door trim interfering with the door's ability to close.  He worked with the trim, then adjusted the locking portion of the door.  The door immediately looked better.  I asked for the bill & Jane said, ""no charge.""   The clatter is now gone! 

Thank you to Jane & Mike for such helpful, FAST service.  After breakfast I'll head to the the dealership to talk to service about an engine inspection I don't have special test equipment for.

My friend and I had no reservations and we walked right in and were sat immediately - we went on a Wednesday around 7 PM. But other times that I have gone, I have also gotten seated fairly quickly and have had great service! 

The service here is always great, I want to point out one bartender and a waitress who are great: David and Emily (from last night). The experience with David was great and he was very engaging and we had a great conversation and even better service, he is also very knowledgeable about the drink menu and bartending in general. Emily was great and extremely attentive to our needs. She never once let our drinks be empty and she was able to provide great menu suggestions. Thank you both!

The food here is also great - my favorite and go-to appetizer is the Chicken Nachos, which was until last night when I tried the POW-POW Shrimp. These two are definitely tied for my favorite appetizer from here - just depends on my mood! Last night I got the tenderloin and the chipotle aioli was phenomenal - they do have a special batter that they coat the tenderloin in, so it has a different taste than the ""normal"" tenderloin you may be used to - but it's definitely a must-try! My friend got the Beer-Braised Beef and she said ""it was HEAVENLY. 10/10 would go back and get again."" Also, their fries are great!

The parking lots attached to the restaurant were closed for outdoor seating/an event. We added our names on the list and they told us it was a 90-120 minute wait for three. I thought this was a little exaggerated but I was completely wrong and we waited two hours for our table. We should have made reservations on Open Table when we had the chance. We waited the majority outside but found a spot at the dry bar which was first come first serve. We were able to order drinks and get chips and salsa while we waited. Naturally once we put in our order our table was as ready. We were seated and the music and vibe were pretty fun. We had to track down our margarita orders because they got lost and we waited 30 minutes to get them. For dinner I got the trio of three tacos and got the carne asada remix tacos. They were tasty but nothing special. I appreciated that the menu indicated what was gluten and dairy free since I'm both. I got rice and beans as a side and that also complimented my meal nicely.

How WRONG was!!??

Their workers on the day of the install arrived almost 2 hrs late, stating they had to pick up some supplies somewhere. It made me feel:  hmm, this is $15k project, the materials used here are about $2500 and they do not need even the full day to install everything, how wisely I am spending my money?

We should start pounding on NJ Clean Energy Program board and demand to weed our scammers like AlliedExperts.   Their Home Performance With ENERGY STAR program it's nothing but huge waste of resources. NJCEP doesn't even follow up and gathers data how effective their program might be! For sure it's a great idea, but any brilliant idea poorly executed remains a FAIL. My house energy data supports this. I have not noticed much of a difference after their install. The only difference noteworthy is, I am stuck with the $10k loan for the next 10 years. 

AlliedEx used my current Nest thermostat and didn't bother to leave the intended one with me, can you on the next project, right?

An arepa is a type of latin sandwich from Venezuela and Colombia. The word ""arepa"" refers to the flat and round corn flour patty that is used as the bun. It's a little bit like a tortilla except fatter and puffier. When Ávila Arepa opened a few years ago in Strathcona they were the first Venezuelan restaurant in the city and they've been dishing out arepas aplenty ever since. In fact, in 2018 VUE Weekly gave them just about every award possible; #1 Best Appetizers 2018, #1 Best Soups 2018, #1 Best Salads 2018, #1 Best Spanish 2018, #1 Best Mexican/Latin American 2018, #1 Best Sandwiches 2018, #1 Best Hidden Gem 2018, #1 Best Bargain 2018. Ávila Arepa has been one of the hottest places in town ever since.

A self-proclaimed ""urban Venezuelan kitchen,"" Ávila Arepa was opened by an actual Venezuelan immigrant who is bringing latin vibes, homemade flavours, and traditional food with a twist. You feel it the minute that you enter the restaurant and are met with bright colours and latin music. It feels like taking a little vacation! I especially loved the mural in the front entrance that wraps around the walls and down across the floor. You'll see a lot of distressed wood, from the counters to the tabletops, that gives a hip tropical feeling to the space. I loved the comfortable and boisterous atmosphere.
The friendly gentleman at the cash was happy to take my order and was very helpful. I was excited (as usual) to find some interesting beverages on the drink menu and immediately went for the Maltín Polar (Venezuelan non-alcoholic malted beverage. The perfect sidekick for your empanada! - $3.00). I loved this drink! It was very unique and different. The malt flavour really comes through and the carbonation and colour makes it feel a little bit like a coke. I liked this a lot especially since I've always enjoyed malt in various forms.

There are two sections on the menu that seem the same but different; Sidekicks and Yums. Both are full of things that I would love to try. The Yuca Frita (Fried cassava sticks with Venezuelan mojito - $6.00) were an absolute must for me because I rarely come across them and I love them very much! Yuca is the root of the cassava plant and it looks a lot like a sweet potato or yam. I don't know what it is about these things, but I love the flavour and texture of them. These ones were wonderful and fried to a golden perfection. A totally different mouthfeel compared to french fries, yuca is much starchier and really captures the crispiness in a magical way. The Venezuelan mojito dip on the side was oily, garlicy, and herbaceous - nothing even close to ketchup (and I say this in the most approving way possible).

I also couldn't ignore the Cochino Frito (Half pound of fried pork bites with guasacaca - $9.00) because the only option for them had to be ""delicious."" Little bites of amazingness and possibly the perfect snack. These small chunks of pork have an intense deep-fry on them, creating something quite similar to well-done, yet still chewy bacon. You could just keep popping these into your mouth and not even realize that you'd eaten the whole thing - they've got that addictive quality about them. The guasacaca - the Venezuelan answer to guacamole - was especially creamy and wonderful, with a bright, tangy flavour. You could put that stuff on anything/everything.
I didn't even get around to the Tequeños (Venezuelan cheese sticks), Patacones (Venezuelan nachos made with fried plantain instead of chips??), or the Empanadas. Needless to say, I must return.

OK. It's arepa time. Ávila Arepa has two sections for them on their menu; Classic and Signature. Combined there are 22 different versions available which provides a ton of choice and endless options. The first one on the Signature list is the Ávila (Oven roasted pork, cheddar, tomato and arugula with spicy aurora sauce - $14.50) and I figured that since it was my first visit I should probably try the self-titled arepa. I also added fried plantain ($2.00) because it could only make things even more amazing. Additionally, I took the ""add salad"" option and requested the Venezuelan coleslaw ($1.00) on the side. As soon as I got my hands on this thing I would tell that it was literally bursting with flavour. I could barely wait to sink my teeth into this erupting corn bun of dreams. The meat was impossibly tender and juicy, melting away in my mouth. The pork is really special and I want it on every arepa that I eat from now on. The cheese provided a wonderful melty tang, I mean, you can never go wrong with cheese. The tomato and arugula were both bright and fresh, adding the ideal freshness to the other heavier flavours. Adding the fried plantain was the absolute correct choice and I loved the fried sweetness that they added, and especially the spicy-sweet combo that was created with the glorious aurora sauce, of which everything was soaked in. And the arepa itsel",2021-01-26 18:53:19,1015,5000,

Additionally, when I dropped her off she was terrified to go in there and I could hear dogs crying from the front desk. After my conversation with the owner I had to find an alternative option last minute for someone to pick her up ASAP and remove her from there. This was my second time coming here and I should've known not to come back from my first visit when the owner and a front desk girl were speaking negatively about other customers with each other in front of us during our first visit and again, I could hear dogs crying inside. 
I will not be bringing my pet there again and would not recommend it. It seems as though they have a higher emphasis on logos and the outside look of the place rather than the importance of customer service and truly delivering a good experience for their main/only customers - the pets and their owners.",2021-01-04 00:01:24,342,1695,

I thought it was suspicious that all the staff went into the kitchen and everyone stopped making tea. Then my drink was served in a hot cup (used for coffee, not clear). I took a few sips and noticed that I got jelly pieces, not boba. Once I got home I took a video and poured the contents of my drink into a clear cup to see what I actually got. The staff never informed me that they ran out of boba or if I wanted to substitute it for a different topping. I'm very disappointed and honestly upset that they tried to cover it up by putting my drink in a different container so I couldn't see what they gave me... 
Picture added. Video was too long to post here but will add to their facebook page.

Highly reccomend this to all foodies from boba newbies to connoisseurs. From left to right: Strawberry Yakult w/ golden boba, mango green tea w/ golden boba, taro milk tea w/ cheese cream and egg pudding, monster latte w/ golden boba.
I must say I've never had cheese cream on a drink and it was delicious, their taro milk tea is also spot on! Not powdery or grainy but blended smoothly to milky perfection. In addition, I've never had yakult mixed with a drink and this will be one of my new favorites. Very sweet, strong strawberry aroma with a kick of creamsicle flavor. The boba texture is made perfectly and probably the best in town. A soft outer layer, middle layer with a gummy texture, and center is not firm and overcooked. Boba is not too chewy, has a sweet light honey flavor finish and golden color unlike normal boba tapioca pearls.

Update: 2nd visit ordered the Aloe Vera Kiwi Juice w/ golden boba and the Passion Fruit Yakult w/ golden boba. Aloe Vera Kiwi Juice was very unique. Refreshing and not too sweet. Pieces of kiwi, crunch from kiwi seeds and I think it was aloe vera chunks. Definitely a nice, smooth summer drink if you dont want something too sweet. 
Passion fruit yakult was yummy and very very sweet. Personally I prefer strawberry. Nothing negative. 
My favorites are still the Taro Mill Tea w/ Cheese Cream and Strawberry Yakult",2021-01-30 04:24:39,442,2145,

The phone was always busy, or it rang to voice saying what their hours were, and to call back if I called within those hours. I cannot find that review, however; I was informed via email that MANY people had looked at my post because I had included a picture from my phone of the number of calls with this company's name.

I called Tues 1/19 and miraculously got through on the 19th call. I wanted to know if they were picking up that day since they did NOT pick up on the prior Friday which is my schedule. She said they were going to.

This company is being held together by a lick and prayer; and they have continually gotten worse and worse. 

They do not use their social media to update their clients of any problems, scheduling differences, when they ARE coming, you just have to just keep filling your can and putting it out praying they will come (either on Tues or Friday). 

Tuesday 1/19 after I got off the phone w/the young woman, I called another company to set up business with them, and have called Bob's 65 times today 2/21/21. SIXYTY-FIVE times. It is either busy or it goes to voice telling the hours, or it rings to either the 9th or 10th ring and then starts a busy signal.

I wrote a letter on 1/19/21 and mailed it advising them of cancelling my service and requesting a refund. 
I have posted on their Facebook page the same information probably six times; I have now included that same information in comment areas so they cannot delete my posts. I have messaged them through Facebook and they have not responded. 

They are incapable of running a business with working equipment, and their personnel who do the pickups have had to stop in front of my home to fix their truck at least once. 

If you look at their Facebook page you will see nothing but complaint after complaint; I have tried to work with them for this past quarter and find it impossible; have cancelled service, asked for a refund and am unable to get through to this company through any medium. 

Do NOT do service with these people, and if you do, do not complain about it, because it will not change nor will it improve, it will get worse just as mine has.",2021-01-21 22:14:31,464,2259,

We went tonight for my birthday as we come here for all special occasions. I was underwhelmed for the first time..mainly because of the service. Our waitress was so blah and not the friendliest. We had to ask for things like bread several times. And it took 30 mins to get. I would ask a question and she wouldnt even respond so I didn't even know if she was being rude or didn't hear me. She only asked half the table if they wanted dessert or coffee. We were also against a wall and she kept going behind us when it was unnecessary and bumping and moving our stuff. I asked for a wine recommendation and she was indifferent. So when I asked to try a couple before ordering a couple of bottles she seemed annoyed. It was my birthday and my husband I wanted to do the tasting and she was very short when I asked if we could get it and she said ""no."" I guess the whole table had to get it? Then she dropped off ice cream after We told her it was my bday and she didn't ask if she could do anything, even though it was on our reservation and I was opening gifts. She didn't say happy birthday or anything. I was just really disappointed as their service is one of my favorite things about this restaurant.

My husband developed early on set dementia and he lost his battle this past October. He was diagnosed January of 2018. Way too soon and I miss him dearly.

Prior to his diagnosis, he was very active with bowling, basketball, Grav Maga and marshal arts;  not to mention our 8 wonder grandchildren and their activities.

Hi buddies, too many to list, would pick him up every two months or so and take him to the Jarrettown Inn as it was close by and he and his friends enjoyed the atmosphere and the especially the food!.

They took my hubby out  this past June for his birthday. 

My husband's dementia had become difficult by this time. But his family and friends stood by him, proudly.

They sat outside and the waitress asked my honey to wear a mask; he didn't like masks due to his dementia (and they were seated sat outside.)  I heard from his great buddies, family and friends that the owner came out to inquire why David was not wearing his mask (mind you they were outside). His family and friends explained the situation to the owner about David and his Dementia. And, I quote the owner said ""I don't give a f..ck about your friend's problem. 
They were shocked and needless to say, finished  their meal, sang Happy Bday to my love and left. 

They will never go back again and either will I after the owner treated my ill husband that way.

I implore everyone in the area to do the same. The owner does not deserve your or my patronage.

Thank you for reading this post as I was very disappointed to hear of this when they brought my honey home. 

Please remember this when you choose a place for dinner or happy hour. I can tell you that everyone I know will not patronize this establishment anymore

Thank you for reading this review and please pass it along to your friends and  families.

I only got the chest of drawers; no bed, night stand or mirror.  The dresser is due in April.  I went to store as the phones are impossible to get through at this time and waited for a manager.  The store manager is Kevin.  I got his assistant Phil, I think his name was.  He was professional listening to the past issues and today's (1/12/21) bedroom set delivery with no bed.  Thank goodness I got a mattress from Wayfair.  Anyway he assured me customer care would call me in a couple days to reopen my damage came frome my 5yr warranty the did not honor and a small refund or store credit since I paid with a check.

Furniture came 1/15/21 delivery people didy an excellent job but would have been nice is they spoke and understood English, but I guess that's what you get.  They work hard and did an excellent job.  It is now 1/16/21, still no call from customer care/service about repairing my other fIurniture damage for the custom suite costing well over $2500.  I will give them until Monday and I will be back at the store again.

I am really trying to give them a chance but they make it hard.  Is CORPORATE listening or do they even care.  It they can't do better than this you really should go somewhere else if you want furniture and service.  I did give the 1 more star because Phil was decent.  I just dont know if he's a liar.

Only because for almost $30 a person nothing was bad but nothing was that good either. Make sure you make a reservation before you go, even if it's for 2 people. And please know, they are not socially distancing people when it comes to seating. 

The self serve station does have plenty of disposable gloves for you to put on prior to getting your own food. I was very glad to see that and it made me feel safe about getting the food. Salad bar looked amazing from afar but upon further investigation I wasn't impressed. But then again, I'm not a big salad person so you probably shouldn't take my word for it. The lobster bisque was really good, and i also liked this pasta salad they had. 

I got a guava lemonade and the bf got a mango lemonade both were really good so I highly recommend trying out their lemonades. 

Servers came by constantly with different cuts of meat and I will say that all the servers were so nice and friendly. The chicken thigh was really good, along with sirloin. Grilled pineapple is a must, so sweet and delicious. They even had chicken hearts which I love but the boyfriend was not about that life. Oh well more for me!!! We don't eat pork so I'm sorry I can't tell you about the pork stuff. One thing about all the grilled meats though, can we get some salt and pepper on them thangs?? I need more seasoning!! More flavor!!

This is becoming a harsh reality, but I am always appreciative when the effort is made in establishments where their county doesn't enforce their local mandates.

After walking into a couple of other establishments where masks were not being worn, we opted to dine here. Masks were being worn and for the most part, properly worn. Sanitation was being practiced as well. We were grateful for that.

My friend and I sat outside to enjoy the fresh air on their patio. It was still really cool outside, but luckily there were heaters to enjoy. We opted for outside since inside was a little crowded. The patio is pretty vast. This was probably put in place and compromised a lot of the parking, but who says you can't have patio weather in the winter time? I mean, it is Tennessee. Weather changes in 5 minutes without much notice.

The food we had was decent. I was particularly happy with my meal and the portion size for the cost. Additionally, the beer list was solid and had local offerings. 

Service was good. She checked in as needed being that we were the only ones outside. She didn't keep us waiting for anything and the food was delivered warmed and promptly. The namesake of the restaurant pretty much reflects the type of food they have - American. Honestly, you couldn't get more American than here.

They were so accommodating during the ups and downs of planning our wedding during this CoVid pandemic and Constantly encouraging us and reminding us that they would be there , no matter where we ended up having our reception. 
Okay okay.. now about their cocktails. O..M...G!!! They are out of this world, every drink we tried at our initial tasting was amazing. It was so hard to not want every single drink they had to offer at our wedding. (Although we did get a few extra, because they are THAT good) Each cocktail is hand crafted with special touches that compliments the couple as well as the wedding. They go above and beyond to make every person at your event feel so special and loved with just one simple interaction with them at the trailer.

1. Weight equipment -- they have a very impressive variety of quality machines, free weights, etc.  You won't find anything better in St Louis city limits - period. Seriously, the new downtown Y, OneLife, Sante, Planet Fitness, Fitness Factory, etc...no one comes close. Fit City is the hands down winner.

2. Cardio equipment -- with such a great weight lifting side, you would think they'd have cardio covered and they do sort of.  They have a ton of equipment. The problem is that almost all of it is old, rusting out, and filthy. On nearly every machine, you can see visible rust where people have sweat and no one bothered to clean/maintain.  And the units that have TV capabilities aren't hooked up.  Two other weird things...the elliptical machines won't return to a ""1"" / neutral incline.  Even when they are set to ""1"", they still operate at an incline. Lastly, the placement of the cardio equipment is bizarre. Of three total rows, two of them placed in socially awkward positions. First row faces a wall with your back toward the rest of the gym. Third row is also set with your back to the gym, directly face-to-face with the 2nd row. AWKWARD.

3. Filth/disrepair - Other than the rusting out cardio equipment, you can look around in any direction and just tell no one ever cleans the place. Dust accumulation on the floor, mildew on the floor, places where sweat hit but wasn't cleaned, etc. Many of the TVs aren't working, and oh...in the middle of COVID, NONE of the hand sanitizer stations have any sanitizer.",2021-01-01 19:02:50,364,1685,

The bartender Nancy made the most amazing drink called a black mamba .....she said it was made with extra love . We immediately knew she was a bartender only interested in making it a great experience for us . The next 35 minutes was spent listening to Nancy's accomplishments of going to school full time and working full time . You'd think most people would not be very personable being so busy and tired with such a full schedule. But not Nancy. She was fantastic . 
We immediately knew we were coming back soon. 

Move forward one week to today and we said we are absolutely going back .....and having brunch. And bringing friends. 
Today did not disappoint ( except that Nancy wasn't there ). We had the absolutely best time ever . 
Tori our server was so fantastic . She was lively ...energetic ....and just an absolute joy to be our server. We can be a little rowdy ....and she played right along with us the the whole time . 
The food is and amazing 5 stars .....always has been. 
The cocktails ...the oysters ....wings ....clam chowder ...cheese steak egg rolls ....Brussel sprouts ...crab cake sliders I'd put up their with the best I've ever had.

I went to buy a new iPhone for my wife (she qualified for an upgrade)and was told the best deal I could get was to ""add a line"" and it would only add $10/month.   After going through the hour+ process at the store and 30 minute drive home, the new phone had the wrong SIM card.  So.... I drove back to the store, Adrian switched the SIM card and acted like he had solved a huge problem.  No apology.
Well, I got our latest bill and it was over a $100 increase so I called AT&T Support.  They were helpful, but I was transferred 3 times (80 minutes on the phone).  Finally the Customer Loyalty person said that there was no need to add an extra line and that the rep in the store should have told me that.
Worst of all, he told me to return to the store, ask to speak to the Manager and explain things.  Well after waiting outside for 40 minutes, I was let in and I asked to speak to the Manager.  The rep kept repeating that he  could handle it if I would tell HIM instead of the manager.  So I explained to the rep what happened and he WENT TO THE MANAGER and explained what I had JUST told him.  Another 30 minutes of ""adjusting the account"" and he said they had taken off the new line.  When asked why the original rep had told me that ""adding a new line was the best deal"" the new rep just said ""I don't know why he would do that"".  (Does the word commission mean anything to you).  I never did get to talk to the manager, but on my way out I said ""thanks"" to him from long distance.

As a perk, we were allotted a cookie sample of our choosing or via a personalized quiz.  The quiz asked several different questions and the results of that quiz would decide your cookie(s).  A few folks shared their quiz.

NOLA Cookie Co. has so many delicious gourmet cookies packed with nothing but deliciousness!  I'm talking toffee, caramel, double and triple chocolate, M&M's, buttered pecan, red velvet, Fat Tuesday and so much more. 

For my complimentary cookie, I chose and baked my double chocolate cookie while waiting for the event to begin and wow, what a treat!  This cookie was moist, ooey and gooey with all kinds of chocolate oozing out. 

For some folks, there were delivery issues, as a result of  an overwhelming influx of orders but that is not an indictment of their overall company and/or service.  Brittany is an amazing baker and it's a one-two person operation, so being understanding would be helpful. 

I purchased and picked up my additional order of cookie dough with the 25% off promo code given to us.   Although I requested baked cookies, they were a little behind in baking so I got mine as cookie dough and baked at home.

An employee named Bill entered my personal space repeatedly despite my repeated requests to stay six feet back.  In hindsight my glasses were fogging up due to wearing a mask and the scanner was finicky and not registering my items even when I scanned them.  This is how the incident started: One of my items did not ring up properly and I did not notice and set it in the grocery bag.  Instead of simply verbally asking me to re ring the item Bill entered my space and grabbed the item and placed it back on the right side of the register.  I told him please do not touch my items due to Covid and he began to accuse me of attempting to steal food.  I told him I was happy to re ring the item and proceeded.  A second item didn't scan properly and again instead of prompting me to re ring Bill again entered my personal space grabbed the item only this time he began to directly accuse me of stealing.  I stood my ground and repeatedly asked him to give me six feet of space and to please stop touching my grocery items.  Bizarrely, my difficulties with fogging glasses and the finicky scanner led to this employee repeatedly entering my personal space picking up my grocery items peering at the register screen raising his voice and being within one foot of me.  He then began verbally complaining about me to anyone within hearing raising his voice and then laughing about how he has to deal with customers stealing.  He then complained out loud that this is what he has to deal with as a ""front line worker.""  I asked him why he would presume a customer may not also possibly be a front line worker? I work with adults with disabilities and all I do everyday is provide support to the vulnerable in my community.  I could not believe how this situation was unfolding and I became so anxious my mask was fogging up more and I made more mistakes.  I put my card into pay, at this point Bill was insisting on standing one foot from me and I was so uncomfortable I forgot to hit the pay button.  I was leaving with my groceries and he demanded I pay for my groceries.  Bills behavior throughout this ordeal assumed the worst intentions on my part, he treated me as a thief  instead of a customer with fogged up glasses dealing with a scanner that wasn't responding.  After I left the store I called the manager Chris and his response was that it was simply a miscommunication.  I am a respectable member of my community and a licensed clinical social worker.  I have never stolen groceries in my life.  After I left I continued to feel distressed thinking about how this employee who wrongly believes himself to be some kind of front line hero may be treating vulnerable customers like an elderly person with dementia or a person with special needs.  This is no way to treat a customer ever.  If this Acme cannot prevent grocery theft without violating six feet of personal space and not touching a customers grocery items then in my opinion they cannot maintain safe Covid protocols and are putting many customers in the self checkout line at risk to prevent stealing from a small number of bad apples.  This employee Bill needs retraining and possibly an assessment of some kind because as a woman his behavior felt verbally and physically aggressive towards me. I do not say this lightly, I am a licensed social worker and a licensed behavior therapist in Pennsylvania.  If anyone else has been mistreated by this employee I strongly encourage you to make a complaint, none of us deserve to be intimidated and harassed by a grocery store employee when we are simply going about our day.",2021-01-31 14:08:40,706,3687,

The food is always good and the service is quick and the price is around the same as the other Thai places in this area. Walking in, it is a dimly lit - more intimate setting with an awesome bar wall (about 10 feet of wine bottles from bar height up) - this place is decorated well and creates a good ambiance. The food has always been great, I haven't strayed too far from my norm (Pad Thai and Orange Chicken) because I know that I will get a great meal and be satisfied afterward! 

Yesterday we decided to get an appetizer and we settled on the Chicken Satay - this was a great decision, however, it was most definitely an appetizer for only two and no more (small serving size). The Chicken Satay is thinly sliced chicken on skewers and then grilled - it also comes with a sweet cucumber salad (amazing!) and peanut sauce. The peanut sauce was good, but I wish it were a bit hotter (spice) and a bit thicker - but I love that it was soft chunks of peanuts in it. I got the Orange Chicken and got it as spicy as it could be and it was AMAZING - I have never gotten it that spicy but it added the right amount of kick that I was looking for and satisfied my craving! Jordan got the Thai Basil Chicken Fried Rice (his go-to for any Thai place) and he was said it was great and the medium spice level was perfect for him! I tried some of his and I liked it too - oftentimes I think the basil can overpower the rest of the flavors, but this was the perfect combination to please the palette. 

The service here is quick - I think that is the best way to describe it. I am not offended by this at all, but it definitely is just that - service. There is little to no small talk/ pleasantries, but my drink was always full and my food was ordered and delivered in a timely manner. 

Overall this is a great place to eat and they have awesome food - also be sure to check out their daily specials (one is pictured below) because they sound amazing! I can't wait to go back!",2021-01-09 15:06:41,443,2043,

I found WSGTR in an internet search. Normally I would check them out on Yelp but in my excitement I did not. I strongly advise you to view all the pictures so that you are prepared for the unique aesthetic. I was not. You a need to walk along the side of the building to the back. Upon arriving I wasn't quite sure if this ""tea"" would meet my standards, because the grounds are VERY, VERY rustic. At first glance a little rustic? Upon further inspection I could see the careful charm with which the area was curated. We arrived on time for our 1:00 pm veranda (outdoor) reservation for afternoon tea. We were surprised that it appeared we had the veranda to ourselves. It had turned out to be a lovely day I thought everyone would be out there. 

Our server was a cordial young lady. I have an allergy and cannot eat any wheat. I called ahead to order a gluten free tea. After confirming our preorder, the server helped us pick out the best teas. The teas were fragrant and the tea was as luxurious as I'd expected. Please see the pictures.

We had a lovely time. The experience had good service, a lovely atmosphere, delicious food and the tea of course was yummy. Being new to the area our server even suggested a few attractions, shops and restaurants in the area. I really appreciated the time I spent at WSGTR. I'm hoping to return quite frequently.",2021-01-22 13:58:59,327,1544,

The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the plexiglass at the hostess podium. They seem to be following necessary indoor dining safety measures, including staff wearing masks and keeping customers separated properly within the restaurant. I'm not sure if there was a maximum capacity for guests inside, but it wasn't crowded. We were asked if we would mind sitting at a tabletop by the bar. It was a comfortable space for all in my opinion. 

I ordered a White Claw and was not expecting it to be so big! It was like a pounder and took me forever to finish. To start, we ordered Buffalo cauliflower. I have to say, this was one of the most delicious buffalo cauliflower appetizers I've ever had. It's fried and crispy, but not greasy. Smothered in Buffalo sauce with blue cheese dressing underneath and pickled onions. 

I told myself I was going to be healthy this year and stay on track when dining out, so I ordered a Greek salad as my meal. The way this salad was crafted was absolutely insane. Tons of toppings including Kalamata olives, feta cheese, artichokes, and fried onions! Wow! The dressing was a plum vinaigrette and wasn't overpowering at all. My friend ordered a Caesar salad with grilled chicken and it looked very appetizing. The menu had a few protein options for their famous Caesar salads; fish, chicken and steak.

I felt no guilt after devouring the food at Issac Newton's. Service was excellent and there was plenty of parking when we arrived. 
I'll surely be returning for some more fun food and drinks next time I'm in the area!",2021-01-11 12:31:59,362,1767,

The second time, I hosted an event and things were not so great. When I booked the room, I was told that I would be able to play music & could hook my laptop up to the television in the private room and close the door. I received a text the day of the reservation and confirmed my arrival . Once I arrived, I had to wait about 5-10 mins because the staff did not have keys to unlock the private room because they were unaware of my party. I asked about the tv and I was told I could not play music on the tv because they did not want others in the restaurant to hear. I thought that was weird because it was a private room with a door. The server was very rude. I had to find him to ask for everything we needed. He took orders, dropped the food off, and never returned. I understood that he was the only person working but that is not an excuse. The restaurant was not busy at all. In addition, I was told by the hostess parking would be validated because in order to have the private room the bill had to be $250. The bill ended up being $450.00 and the server said no to validating parking unless each individual guest spent over $50. One guest spent $20 and he would not validate parking. At the time, I was speaking to the manager and the server kept jumping in the conversation. He was very rude and his attitude was unacceptable. The manager did honor the request. In addition, the server told the manager because I closed the door and played music on my laptop. Not on their system but my laptop. He also charged us 22 percent in gratuity and I've never heard of that. The server put our orders on one tab and told us to add it up ourselves if we wanted it separate and he would take all the cards. He refused to separate our tabs. The manager stepped in and separated our tab. The second experience was unacceptable. We spent 450.00 and were treated like garbage. This is not an acceptable fine dining experience at all. The hash browns looked like McDonald's hash browns full of grease.. My wings were good. Another guest did not like their breakfast. The server also removed someone's plate off the table when we asked him for boxes after waiting 10 mins. That person was not done eating.

They don't have delivery so the option is to either take it to go or dine in. It is located off of 9th Street so you will have to pay for parking in order to dine in. The restaurant is nice and spacious and clean with friendly and polite staff. Just as a little background I'm from Houston, eaten at many great chinese restaurants there and in California since I have family there. This restaurant did taste like home cooking and was very good. It's not quite as good as previous restaurants where I'm from, however, it is one of the best Chinese restaurants in the Boise area.
 My husband and I ordered the hot and sour soup which was perfectly flavored but also has some non-traditional things inside it such as peas and carrots (carrots are debatable but was missing the mushrooms!). However I would order it again! 
We also ordered Ma po tofu which had excellent flavor and plenty of sauce. The beef chow fun was good but different since it was sweet versus savory. The rice noodles used weren't as thick as what I'm used to in beef chow fun. Last we had the sizzling beef with scallops and it also had green onion and snow peas. This was also very good and was a savory dish. The scallops and beef were fresh and melted in your mouth.
I will definitely be returning to try their dim sum menu. I wish that they had a black bean chicken dish because that's what I was looking for! Highly recommend this restaurant for those who are looking for a more authentic Chinese restaurant in Boise.",2021-01-11 15:58:26,322,1583,

We walked in and was greeted by an older blonde lady who sat us down at the bar per our request. She asked what we wanted to drink and I stated it was our first time so I wanted to take a look at the drink menu. The menu was so small, literally coke products and a milk tea menu that wasn't even available. She then walked away and we waited about 10 minutes before she came back to us. I ordered a water and raspberry ice tea then She quickly walked away without asking if we were ready to order so I didn't even get to order an appetizer yet.. she came back with our drinks a few minutes later. I was finally able to ask for 2 orders pork gyozas, which also took them a while to serve. Our server wasn't attentive to us even though there weren't many people there. Literally 3 other parties (of 1 or 2). The other servers were nicer to their customers. After about 25 minutes of waiting, she finally asked us what we wanted to order so we ordered 2 bowls of kiwami shiro and replaced the pork with chicken. The ramen was ok, but I actually liked JA Ramen better than this place. 

The inside and outside was clean but the inside had a weird smell. Should've asked for outdoor seating but I forgot my jacket today.

8am-I called and was told they were running a bit behind. 
9:30am-I called again and was told they were on the way.
11am-I began getting very nervous because, well nobody was there, so I called again. An employee named Cameron passed me over to Angie who is the manager. She told me they would be there at 1 pm. (Buying time knowing what I know in hindsight)
11 am -My husband (who has just had back surgery) and I begin loading our trucks.
1 pm comes and I call and ask for Angie, but she is on the other line. 1:10 I call Angie and she is unavailable so I ask to hold and they hung up on me. 1:30 I call and ask for Angie and am told that she is in a job interview. I told them I would hold again and to please not hang up on me. They told me it would be 20 minutes, I said that I have already been waiting over 5 hours, so what's another 20 minutes? Surprisingly, Angie picked up within 1 minute. She began yelling at me that they had overbooked and I had no option but to wait. Then she said, ""3 guys will be there by 2 pm"". Well, I asked for 4, now they are over 5 hours late and down to 3 guys. It gets dark in Nashville around 4pm which does not make for safely moving furniture without getting it damaged. Not to mention I have to be OUT of this house TODAY. After she was done yelling at me, she hung up on me. At this point I felt helpless, I began calling other moving companies in a panic because I really didn't know if they were coming at all. 
2:15pm still no movers. I call AGAIN. I am put on hold for Angie and she picks up and yells, 'WHAT??!!' I said asked what the location and ETA was she said the traffic was bad but they were on the way and hung up on me again and told me not to call back. I literally had a breakdown, not only from being treated like that but from being in an all-out panic about getting my house cleared out. They show up at 3:30. They were worn out, I imagine they get yelled at all day as the customers do. By this time we had 45 minutes of daylight left. At 7pm Angie called to collect the balance that she quoted my balance to be 268.00. I had already paid $100 deposit making the total $368. The next day she had run my card for $650, won't answer the phone or return my calls. I contacted an attorney that told me to dispute the charge which I have. My receipt is handwritten on a pad of paper I had because the movers told me Angie never sent them a contract for my move. (See picture) Are you kidding me?

Alas currently, I am working from home and downtown is currently a bit of a trek for me. Fortunately, Khazana Indian Express is close to my home, and was the perfect alternative.

We ordered the butter chicken because we were having a craving and of course, you can't order butter chicken without naan, so we ordered some of that as well! We took a shot on the tandoori salmon, as we wanted to add another dish, but didn't necessarily want another curry and wanted a different protein. 

All of the above was delicious! The naan tasted like it had just come out of a fire roasted oven and had that extra smoky flavour which I thought really made it next level. We had the garlic naan. There were a couple options, but wasn't feeling like the regular naan. The garlic naan was delicious.  Next time I'm at Khazana, I will definitely get the garlic naan again! The butter chicken had a generous amount of chicken and was perfectly spiced! The salmon was the spicier of the 2 dishes, but I did not mind it at all. It cleared out my sinuses and I love that feeling when eating spicy food :) It was a beautiful bright and colorful red from the tandoori spices, I imagine. It also had a bit of a smoky flavour, and the fish was perfect flaky and tender inside!

hzGnWsTsZrUwE1mvNc6fVQ,6APJlluOroa7JVxZtmt_6A,xhmgQtl9gooBJybCuXBZPA,3,2,0,2,"I'll try to keep this brief. I like this Dunkin' location for only two reasons, the first being that it has a drive-thru and the second being that it's close to the Riverwalk so I can just grab something to go and just relax by the Riverwalk. The drive-thru is moderately paced. I've been there at several different times and it was about the same every time for me. Not fast, not super slow. 

One reason I've removed two stars and am honestly teeter on a 2 star review is that there is a Starbucks directly next to it which makes navigating the two parking areas extremely difficult since both businesses usually have long drive-thru lines that wrap around and out into the cross streets and thoroughfares. 

The second reason I've demoted this Dunkin' in star recognition is that they are inconsistent. I've ordered through the app several times and either they forget items I've ordered, only fill the cup partially full without request, or the same beverages taste extremely different depending on what time of day you come or who made the beverage. I don't care much for Starbucks but at least they are somewhat more consistent. I purchased a strawberry refresher once and the syrup they made it with kind of made a weird oily-looking layer on the bottom of the cup and when I sucked it up through the straw it was warm which was odd and also unpleasant feeling. It also did not taste like strawberries.

The workers also have a lack of emotion in their voice regarding friendly customer service. They don't consistently ask ""how may I help you"" or confirm that they heard your order correct. It's just ""Ok, pull through.""

The last reason I subtracted stars is that this Dunkin' is a hang out for those without homes. It doesn't bother me a whole bunch because maybe they have nowhere else to go, but if visually looking at the business from the outside at night, one may have second thoughts about visiting this Dunkin'. So, I guess it's from an aesthetics standpoint. 

I usually just try to go to the one closer to my home as they are much more consistent and usually have no problems keeping items in stock without substitutions.",2021-01-28 22:06:08,425,2140,
sx3fOPHb_Y2PsHIPpsYIFQ,VIOycFzrCI--pLxDkp8M6g,AAWxOn6jTOXThAFSzlXubw,1,0,0,0,"Let me start off by saying my review has nothing to do with the wonderful hospital staff. They treated great for both of my surgeries. 
For three years, I had been in and out of Banner and other ER's, neuros and so many other specialist to find out why I was having such terrible face & head pain. I was finally diagnoised with TN. Meds did not work, so I made an appointment to see Dr Kassoff. Right before my appointment, I had to go to the ER. They had the on call neuro come see me. The first thing he did was touch my face without changing his used gloves, after seeing a critical patient! I was in shock and I think he realized what he had done. He left the room and never came back. I finally told the nurse I was not comfortable being there. I had already been there for 8 hours. She agreed and remove my IV and encouraged me to file a complaint.
I finally had my visit with the surgeon, Willard Kassoff. He seemed professional and had a good beside manner. He explained all options and almost everything of what the surgery would involve. He forgot to tell me that I would have a metal plate inserted in my head! Shortly after my surgery  we were hit from behind coming home from the pharmacy. I had some serious head pain and went to see him about a week later. I kept telling him the side of my head hurt really bad right after the accident. He tells me that the surgery didn't work and it would need to be done again. I told him I needed to check with my family. It ended up I had Shingles, which can happen after this type of surgery. He never bothered to check my face.
When I went on my portal to read his office notes, I had found he added that I left AMA for the other neurologist! He was adding notes when he didn't even know what had happened. I tried to change neuro surgeons. A new neuro surgeon won't take you until everything is clear with the other surgeon (90days). Even if they pull a stunt like Kassoff did. Sadly, there was something wrong with my head. Kassoff said it was a CFL and I had to continue my care under him. I thought I could wait until the Covid issue calmed down but my head got really bad. I called one weekend, no reply from the on call neuro surgeon. I was so sick and nothing until I called again that Monday. I received a call from Diane his MA. She said surgery had been scheduled, but I needed to come ot the clinic to see Kassoff before my surgery. I had just seen him a week before. She was laughing like she thought it was funny when I said how sick I was. No tele call or video??
At this point I was so sick I dodn't care. I went for my two minute visit. I honestly think they thought I was exaggerating how sick I was. There was no need to go in for a visit. I had my surgery that Friday and come to find out, it was not a CFL, it was some sort of ""fluid build up"" per Kassoff. 
No one ever bothered to say, ""Oh, sorry you were stuck without an on call doctor. 
 While I was expressing my frustration of having to go in for no reason and no call back for an emergency to Diane the MA. My cell phone cut off and she told Kassoff I hung up on her. I lose calls all the time and getting back though to them is impossible. When she tells Kassoff I hung up on her, I got a message via portal that I hung up on his MA and that was not tolerated, Scolding me for something I did not do. 
Sadly, I was still having problems and I had no choice but to see him. I went in for him to check my incision since the end sutures were draining and he said it was fine. It was not fine! 
I ended up having to remove one that was sticking me in the neck. I am sure he would have at least done that, but I just wanted out of that place. How do you expect a patient to react when they are in pain and it takes four days to get back to the patient....after the patient calls and messages the doctor and you are required o go to the clinic when you can't even stand up?
Now, I am stuck without a neuro surgeon. I do not trust him to treat me because he is only obligated to do so for the remaining 90 days and that is not going to happen. 
Too many things this guy has taken upon himself to do, or assume without checking the facts. How can a doctor add visit notes for another doctor that really never saw you??? How could I leave AMA when the nurse removed my IV and walked me out. How can it be considered AMA when a neurologist touched you with contaminated gloves??
I also asked Kassoff for referrals to another surgeon and he gives me one that doesn't take my insurance and another Neuro Clinic that misdiagnosed me in the beginning. Great help...
I have been in the medical field most of my adult life and feel so defeated because I spoke up and said I was frustrated that no one called me back during an Emergent situation and I was told I had to make a 40 minute drive to see him before my surgery...when it could have been a simple video visit. This was wrong in so many ways.",2021-01-21 03:00:17,1086,4918,

I was never shown the jewelry before I got pierced. Additionally, the piercer (whose name I never learned) said that her personal preference was to not mark the spot where I would be pierced, so I had no way of knowing where the piercing would end up. When I asked if she could show me in any way where the piercing would be, she seemed slightly irritated and said it wasn't possible. I asked if she could pierce my nose in a specific spot, and even though she said yes, the piercing ended up exactly where I said I didn't want it. If the anatomy was wrong, that's perfectly fine, but I wish I would have known in advance. I had no warning as to when I would be pierced, and instead was just told to take a deep breath and then I was pierced. I'm used to being walked through the entire experience, and even though I'm experienced at receiving piercings, it's always nice to be on the exact same page as the piercer.

To her credit, the piercer made sure I had thorough aftercare instructions and even helped me switch the jewelry for another piercing free of charge. 

The entire trip, from entering the store to leaving, was about 20 minutes, and this was with an appointment (which is required). I appreciated the speed, but I would have sacrificed that for a more thorough experience.

The price for a septum piercing with a simple silver 16g ring was $50. Great price!!

Overall, the shop seemed clean and decently guarded against Covid-19.

I'm not sure if the logistics of ordering are a COVID thing, but in any case it's a bit strange. After being seated we were told to order drinks at the bar and food at another counter. Food gets delivered to your table but you don't technically have a server. Someone did come by a few times to check on us... so I guess she was kinda sorta the server? The concept doesn't make sense to me. Why not just give us a check at the end so we know who to tip and whatnot. The system gave me café vibes, which was strange for a dining space with so much potential. 

ANYWAY. I had the original tori ramen and added corn to it. Noodle texture was nice. The charsu pork was melt-in-your-mouth good. Seasoned egg was not at all seasoned, I don't think it was left in the marinade for long enough. Lastly, the broth was much too salty. The delicate umami balance is what I crave in a ramen bowl and unfortunately it was just too heavy handed with salt. A good ramen broth should make ya wanna drink every last drop of it, this wasn't it. My sweetie ordered the dirty mazemen, which was nice and creamy from the poached egg, however I didn't love the bell pepper flavor in there. Overall, this place has great potential, just seems like there's a few loose ends left to tie. I really believe a regular sit-down, server-guest model would make the experience much more enjoyable for everyone.",2021-01-14 22:29:33,317,1481,

We were lucky because a party from the waitlist didn't show up so we were able to get seated right away! While we were dining we overheard the wait to be around 30 minutes. You order with the cashier in the bar area and they give you a number you place on your table. Someone will bring your food out to you. They also have someone who floats to refill waters. 

We started out with an Old Fashion (just ok) and the Sparkling Plum (highly recommend)! We also got the Shishito peppers and spam musubi. The shishito peppers were tasty and worth trying. While I appreciate seeing spam musubi on the menu, I am a bit disappointed in it. In Hawai'i, spam musubis are made to be very simple. Spam, shoyu sugar, rice, and nori. It didn't need the  vegetables or aioli. I also found the spam marinade to be a bit overpowering and salty for the spam is already salty on its own. If you've never had spam before I do recommend trying it, I just wish it was more of a traditional spam musubi with at most, an egg added. 

The original tori ramen was outstanding.  The flavor profile of the broth was impressive and the egg was perfectly marinated and soft boiled. The chashu was also prepared nicely and tasted very good! I wanted to try the broth on its own but I can imagine it'll also be good with some added spice (which they can do)! I also ordered the Dirty Mazemen to go. The poached egg comes with the shell on just an FYI before you heat it up. It was very tasty but I think I just prefer ramen with a hot soupy broth. 

Definitely a great place to check out if you're in the mood for ramen! An added bonus is that they stream anime!",2021-01-21 15:48:40,366,1678,

But to my shock and disappointment my nail tech was rude nasty and yelling at me over my choice of nail color. Yes !! Nail color she told me I could not have a light shade on my nails! I thought ok she has had a bad day. But as she yelled at me 4 times and got aggressive with my hand . I started to feel very uncomfortable. I eventually had to say please stop and got up and walked away. Apparently but not to my knowledge until that experience last night with Ally she was very upset as I have in the passed had to come back to have my nail polish redone  as it turned out discolored after a few days. She continued to yell at me you better not come back to have your nail polish Redone with me, four times she continued to yell saying no you can not have a light polish color you must pick a dark color.

After two uneventful visits, our third visit yesterday was extremely disappointing. After a few hours of play on a rainy day, my dog was presented to me reeking of urine. I was advised that the staff had been unable to contact me to inquire if I wanted to add on a bath (at additional charge) because I picked him up early (true). The manager, who was quite polite, advised me that TWB doesn't make the open area available to dogs on rainy days in order to avoid the smell of ""wet dog;"" while she offered me a free bath on my dog's next visit, she couldn't assure me that my dog wouldn't be returned to me NOT smelling of urine on future rainy/snowy days. In other words, I would have to purchase a bath on rainy/snowy days if I were concerned about my dog coming home stinking. The manager was not rude, but she made it quite clear this is their policy. But, I advised her, the only days I need day care are precisely rainy/snowy ones. I don't want to have to pay extra for a bath, the need for which TWB created. 
It appears that the business model of TWB is to up-sell visits to include additional baths, which makes the care expensive and unnecessarily traumatic for my dog. Evidently other day care providers let their dogs out in the yards on inclement days and then towel-dry them before they go home to their families. This should be what TWB does, but chooses not to.

It's a healthier-ish way of getting a great meal quickly, as opposed to fast food. Taco ditty's twist on the concept is, obviously, it's Mexican based. And although you can get tacos and I think burritos, it feels like the focus is on the bowls and the quality of ingredients and variety of options, unlike a Chipotle. The taco dirty in Saint Pete is kind of in a food hall with many of the concepts started by the owners in other locations including a Fresh kitchen, a soul sweet (or is it sweet soul) and a chicken concept the name of which I can't recall. While it is a bit odd that they put two ""bowl"" concepts in one location, Fresh Kitchen is just bowls and they do not have the Mexican twist, so that they are slightly different. However, both are awesome and you can't go wrong with either. 

Standard COVID info-staff is in masks and gloves. Ordering is done on electronic kiosks, which is odd because although you don't have to talk to anyone, you have to touch the same surface as everyone else. That said, there is sanitizer so just make sure you use it. Problem is the customers aren't socially distancing and are crunched together in line. So just be polite and keep your distance from others, or at least, back up away from me Mr Sneezy McCoughsalot. 

On this visit, I got their big bowl, which comes with 2 each of the bases, proteins, veggies and toppings (mexithings).  I kept it pretty boring with brown rice, super greens, verde chicken, verde tofu, brussel sprouts, mushrooms, dirty salsa and vegan queso. Boringish, but delicious. And don't let my choices turn you away. Their offerings are varied and all look delicious. Obviously, they cater to vegans and vegetarians and omnivores alike, and you can even come for gluten free yum yums.

We took our dogs for a weekend and things seemed as usual and went well. Then we took them back a few weeks later for a week stay and have had the worst feeling since picking them up. The drop off and pick up were disorganized and every worker seemed new and confused. We looked for daily pictures of them posted on Facebook and thought it was odd we hardly saw a picture of either of them more than a couple times (TOTAL)....like one every few days, however the majority of the photos seemed to be the same five puppies?? When we picked them up one was limping and had a wound on her ear. I asked them what happened and they said nothing. I called and talked to a manager who said she would call me back and never did. When we took the limping dog to the vet they said it wasn't arthritis that somehow the dog was injured where she was limping. She also said the scratched ear looked like bite marks. Called watering bowl back to tell them the vets report and she said no incidents were noted. I also told them the vet noticed discoloring on her nose that usually means dogs trying to escape being in a cage or kennel. My dog loves the kennel at home---she walks in and sleeps in it on her own. Even when the door is closed (when we are at work) she doesn't mind being in it bc she is only In it 3 hours max. The dog has never had this on her nose either after a stay at Watering bowl. I think they kenneled our dogs more than just at night. The whole experience left a nagging feeling with our family. Not sure if they were understaffed or what but we are now looking into to other places. Something was definitely off the last time and I wish I listened to my gut when we were dropping them off. Our dogs have been extra clingy since the last visit and after over a month the one with a limp is finally running around and playing like normal. This last visit was not the same level of care and professionalism that we normally noticed and with the change in demeanor of both dogs we can't help but wonder how they were treated.

So, we made plans Friday night to venture to the west side of town to try these burgers. The line was around the block, three times over. I felt bad being parked in front of peoples houses, especially as it got late. We got in line at 7:28 p.m and pulled off the lot just before 12:40 a.m., 40 minutes after they were supposed to close. There were cars still in line behind us. 

The concept is cool and the food is good. There is literally something for everyone on the menu and I believe that all the menu items are priced really well. You get a lot of food for not a lot of money. 

OUR ORDER: 
 Two #5 Combos (Double Bacon Burgers) 
 Fried Mushrooms
 Jalapeño Poppers 
 Hot Wings 
 Oreo Milkshake 

They advertise that everything is made fresh to order, but I would say based on the temperature of all the food we ordered, the burgers are definitely made as soon as you order them and so are the shakes. But our jalapeño poppers, mushrooms, and fries were probably sitting under a heat light of some sort. I have no problem with that, this is very common at quick service restaurants. Especially if eventually it means their line will move faster.

The burger was really good, it was still warm by the time I got home 20 minutes later, and it was a lot bigger than I expected for the price. It was well packaged and tasted great. The fries were seasoned well and I loved that the Jalapeño poppers were more like fried spicy cheese with jalapeño pieces rather than a whole jalapeño fried, super good. The Oreo milkshake and mushrooms were just okay. Pretty standard. 

So, why rate it only three stars? The wait. Five hours is too long for burgers and fries, even 1-2 hours is too long. I estimated that ~50 cars were in front of us and maybe only a dozen behind us. That means they're serving an average of 10-12 cars an hour. I've worked at QSRs, this isn't sustainable, the line has to move faster. It was fun to spend time with my partner during the wait, but we aren't always going to have 5+ hours to wait. I suspect others won't either. 

My advice if you're looking to go: maybe wait until spring time when the hype has died down and they've smoothed out their process a bit better. If you must go now, I'd say start lining up before they open (someone on their Instagram did this and was still 21st in line) or go about an hour before closing when the line is the shortest.",2021-01-31 15:33:15,536,2518,

Secondly, the shape: it's a complete full round, complete with radius, diameter--and pi, lol :-) I was not expecting the shape--and somehow, the sheer charm of it threw me off balance in a good way. We had them cut it in several sections, they do 4 as de facto. One section we could barely finish, so piled high with provolone cheese, salami, ham mortadella, and a picked vegetable/marinated mixed olive/herb concoction that you must taste to believe. I knew that they would pile on waaay too much meat for us, so we asked them to give us 1/4 of the meat as they usually put on it--and still, it was way too much meat for us. It ended up being a perfect ratio of veggies to spicing to cheese to meat. We took it to our hotel and sorta dissected the thing, stuck it in our little fridge, did not go out for dinner that night--had some more at night. Yes, wait for it .... we also had it for breakfast--and that day's lunch! Yes, it (one sandwich) was more than enough for multiple meals. This version of muffuletta is the original, the classic, and the best. I've had others (though not many), but none have come remotely close to this, neighboring on a religious experience. If you're in New Orleans, yes everyone crows about beignets, but the muffuletta at this place is the real go to. It's transcendent and a magical, alchemical mix of everything good in this world. Seriously. And the price is ridiculously low for the quality and size of what you'll get. Please. Just. Go already.",2021-01-05 01:36:32,485,2121,

Clearly this Frontega Chicken sandwich  should be called bread, tomatoes, red onions not much chicken and not much cheese sandwich. Then I asked for the free bagel that comes daily for the month of January. Needless to say the lady at the register told me to step over and look at the screen when it says  completed i could pick my order.  When it moved over I went to get my food and there was a Asian lady there that was so rude she said we didn't call you name have a seat. I told her what the lady at the front counter told ms to do and clearly you two have a disconnect so don't take it out on me. She walked to the side and got on her cell phone. Then shortly ther after another lady holding a bag started staring at me but never said my name  I said is that for Nikki she said yes. I told her i wanted to look at my food b4 i get all the way back to work and its wrong again. She said that was fine. So I did and I attached a pic of the horribly prepared chicken lacking sandwich that I was given. Then I asked where the bagel was then the Asian lady flew over to me and asked what else I needed. I told her then she told another guy to give me the bagel. I must say the customer service was horrific! The food was sloppily put together and I would give them zero stars if I could. So sad!

I would normally brush off something like this, but I feel compelled to call this out. I posted a picture of the private message from David D.

Mr. D - Your bullying approach is all wrong. Do you think the owners of Widow Fletcher's want bad reviews? I don't see them responding to anyone, and nothing has changed (per the more recent reviews). I know you read all the reviews and I know for a fact that I wasn't the only one to get a scathing private message from you. You want everyone to report ""great food, great service, 5 stars!!"" but that's not what Yelp is about. And no amount of fake 5 star reviews is going to prop up this restaurant. If you want this place to survive, you'll have to admit that there is a lot lacking. I WANT IT TO SUCCEED. I want to have another dining option close by. But charging what they charge for mediocre food isn't the way to do it. And to have such a cool story behind ""Widow Fletcher"" but not carrying the concept forward at the restaurant is a BIG FAIL. 

I didn't even mention in my review that the handicapped bathroom is IN THE DINING ROOM - not even down a hallway. Sorry, but there are inevitable bathroom smells (and sounds) that happen. It's poor planning.

I don't think there are enough of people like you, who personally attack anyone who doesn't agree with you, around to sustain the restaurant for long. If you truly cared, you'd want the problems solved, and I don't think the owners would agree that telling people that they aren't welcomed somewhere (you know... to spend money) is a solution. Most people (including me) would go back if there were changes made. Do the owners support your stance? You should be ashamed.",2021-01-27 22:26:37,387,1756,

My sever spent most the evening some where other than on the floor . I saw what I will assume was the dining room manager going to several tables of other guest speaking to the people at the table to let them know she was making sure things were corrected and taken care of. My server came over to me to get my first drink order and told him that this gentlemen was trying to get his attention he said thanks looked over at the man and walked into the kitchen . Over the course of the evening he only checked on me twice. I was there three hours to see a band. When I wanted my next drink I walked out to the bar ordered a Bullit rye ( they use jiggers ,no free pour ) straight up , $18.64 ouch ! An hour later I had to go back to the bar to get another drink , Bullit rye on ice $18.00 even , they where out of glass's luckily I had brought the one I was using . And since I did that I was rewarded with a splash of extra rye in my glass , by whom I would say was the bar manager . When I got my bill form my server my Bullit rye on ice was $15. That's $51.64 for three drinks ,that 1.75L bottle cost retail $49.99 . I know they have overhead but really! My shrimp and grits tasted great ,but it was warm at best. When they first opened I was a club member , but there music ( or mine ) changed. And have not been there in a year and half , COVID was of part of the reason,but after last night . It may be that long again . It's a great venue ,they need to get on top there staff and not over charge for drinks . We use to drive up ( a lot ) from Huntsville ( 1 1/2 hr ) because we loved this place . I hope they can get it back to the great place it was .",2021-01-16 15:14:46,398,1763,

Thin, sweet sauce, and stretchy cheese. They were out of garlic knots which was a huge disappointment. But the garlic bread was decent. I'm giving them 3 stars because the service was strange and unprofessional. I get that they just opened, but they are missing some of the basics. 
It started with a awkward encounter with an employee banging of the ladies room door 20 seconds after I entered. He was ""just checking on me"" because he wanted to clean the bathroom and he thought I had just entered. If the employee thought I just entered the rest room, he should have waited 2 minutes for me to be finished. 
We ordered a pizza and garlic bread for dine in, and the lady from the counter brought it over to us in the box with no plates or anything. We said we were staying to eat it and she looked at us like this was an unfamiliar concept to her. We had to ask her to bring plates. We also asked for crushed red pepper, garlic, and Parmesan cheese (3 standard toppings at any pizza place- especially one called NY Pizza!) and she didn't seem to understand, but did bring over two plates and some crushed red pepper flakes. Was this her first time serving pizza? Perhaps, but did a manager or owner not prepare her for typical things a customer may ask for? 
The last unprofessional thing to happen was that while we sat and ate, two employees came around and started stacking chairs and stools all around us. We came in at 7:15 on a Saturday night. They are opened until 8. It is completely inappropriate for employees to be doing these kinds of closing activities while we are still dining in the restaurant and when they were still opened for another 30 minutes. I could completely understand if no one was in the restaurant and some of the chairs were stacked before we entered. Or if it were 8:00 and they started stacking chairs. But I do not want to dine in a restaurant during open business hours and have employees banging chairs around all around me. 
Offering customers a poor dining experience like they did is unacceptable in my opinion. I wasn't looking for 5 star dining with table clothes and silverware set at the table. But I did expect to use the restroom and sit and eat in peace without employees banging on the door after me, and waving stools around in the air two feet from my head while I am eating.

So many goods. A couple flaws. I just moved to the area, and I'm so happy this was my first stop to explore Pville. 

First of all, I absolutely love how open this place is. And it smelled FANTASTIC the second we walked in. Ambiance is perfect. The waiters/waitresses constantly walked by to see if we needed anything. Never an empty  glass. 

The beers: so. Many. Great. Options. I'm a huge NE IPA and Sours kinda gal. They do not disappoint. Cinnaberry Yum Yum. Amazing. Their Juice in Da haze. Great. My roommate and I agreed they're missing a slight sharpness on the back note, but I was still very very happy with our choices. Even my gf liked the sour. Great feat right there. 

The food. Our first negative.. my roommate had to pull a hair off her pizza the second it came out  but literally pulls it off, shrugs  and dives in. ""Eh, I'm still gonna eat it."" And don't act like you've never gotten food in your own home cooked meals. I cracked up and moved along. The pizza was delish! I looove puttanesca. Have had it on many occasions growing up (ask my why it's called the dish of the whores'') and they hit the mark here very close to expectation! Two thumbs up for flavor   however, their crust is sub par. The toppings made it fall to a soppy mess in the center. And the crust was more a stale crispy texture and flavor, not the brick oven style I was hoping for. Eh. Can't have it all. My moo shoo pork tacos were very flavorful, although I would've preferred more heat and slightly less sweet, and maybe grill the corn tortilla for that extra element.  But I still really enjoyed them. My gf got the burger well down (I know. Let's not talk about it) and it was surprisingly delicious! (I like mine still mooing, so you can imagine the issue here).

THE MAC. The carbonara Mac and cheese deserves its own category. Wow. The pancetta. The asparagus. Just do it. Phenomenal to say the least. Happy we decided to split it. And by that I mean I took it home and finished it myself later on. 

So. First outing not without a few kinks, but quite successful. Will return after some more exploring of Bridge Street.",2021-01-24 10:47:53,486,2165,

I'm rounding up the star count 'cause the business concept is excellent, the staff was very friendly, the aestetics are very nice, & the establishment brings some much needed diversity & nightlife to this expanding area. 

This is a 5-person locally-owned business that opens daily @ 11 AM. Closing times are as follows: Monday & Tues 9 PM, Wed & Thurs 10 PM, Fri & Sat Midnight, & Sundays 8 PM. Treble Makers is a restaurant by day & a quasi nightclub each evening. On weeknights, entertainment includes acoustic guitars, small band artists, karaoke, trivia (Tuesdays @ 7 PM for prizes), etc.

Friday & Saturday nights offer the dueling piano shows for adults only from 9:00 to Midnight. From 7:30 PM on, you'll pay $12 per ticket. RESERVATIONS ARE RECOMMENDED for the Friday & Saturday shows, & they can be made thru the restaurant's webpage via OpenTable. If you arrive before 7:30 PM w/o a show reservation, you will be seated at the bar or at any available table; however, without show reservations, it's likely someone has already reserved your table for the 9 PM show. (Note: You won't be asked to move or pay for the show if you are at the bar.) The kitchen closes at 9 PM nightly; only appetizers are available after that time.  

This establishment is spacious w/ its modern decor, high ceilings, varied lighting, glass front (that opens fully to outside seating), a long bar w/ a cool piano keys decor (see pic), & a stage for live entertainment-- see pic. 

We arrived at 7 PM on a Friday night, choosing to sit @ the bar. The very large wall TV behind the bar showcased two fashion-challenged, spandex-clad female fighters beating the crap out of each other. At 9 PM, the dueling pianists began playing short versions of multiple songs from all decades & genres. (Blister in the Sun by the Violent Femmes was my personal favorite.) The two middle aged musicians took written requests & indicated they responded more quickly to requests accompanied by green bills:) Their piano playing was good, just not great. The vocals were average as well. Would I pay $12 for a ticket? I doubt it. Was also not overly impressed w/ the acoustics in this restaurant/bar; the dueling pianos were so loud that it was difficult to converse w/ anyone. 

The food we ordered was good. The Crab Bisque @ $8 was different-- sweet & mild. The Ceasar Salad ($7) w/ added Chicken ($3) was also satisfactory; the dressing had a mayo taste to it. The thick $14 Smokehouse Burger, though, was VERY GOOD! I'm not a fan of any French fries dusted in flour before cooking, yet for me they were worthy. (I'd definitely order this burger again-- loved the Mississippi barbeque sauce, applewood bacon, fried onion ring, smoked gouda cheese, fresh lettuce, ripe tomato, onion slices, & soft Beioche bun-- see pic.) 

Staff was very friendly; however, my date received a water glass accompanied by a heavy imprint of pink lipstick on the ""lip"" of the glass; when the bartender was notified, she said nothing. For us, the dirty glass was more of an ""Ew"" moment rather than one of titillating intrigue:) Mistakes happen, yet an acknowledgement by staff would have been welcomed... & wise.

Lots of food & drink available: beer, cocktails, wines, appetizers ($10 - $13); soups & salads ($6 - $13); handhelds ($10 - $14); pastas ($16 - $28); steaks ($28 - $34); chicken/veal ($18 - $22); fish/seafood ($24 - $26); sides ($5); & desserts ($7 - $9). There's a kids's menu-- four offerings @ $8 each. Treble Makers offers contact-less payment; just scan & pay directly from your bank account. 

If I return, it will probably be to try another burger variety... or possibly the Coconut Curry Grouper entree... or just maybe the Seared Ahi Tuna appetizer-- dang, now I'm hungry:) A weeknight of acoustic guitars really does sound interesting, so I'm pretty sure I'll see Treble Makers again.",2021-01-30 05:46:23,880,3984,

I definitely recommend coming to this Catellos if you want to have an upscale night out that can easily be dress casual, while offering top quality food.

If you are a fan of cheap spaghetti houses, this isn't your place.  But if you like authentic Italian food with options that are coastal (lots of shellfish and fish options), lots of pastas, and a nice selection of salads, sides, and though we were too full to try them, desserts too.

We made lunch reservations for our group and were comfortably arranged near the front windows which provided plenty of light (I am not a fan of very dark restaurants that make it difficult to read the menus.)  Our waitress did a good job of keeping the orders straight (even through the final bills.)  Our group ordered from all over the menu (seafood pasta, paninis, spaghetti, lasagna, salads, and wine.)  Everyone seemed quite pleased with the flavor combinations and portions.  While we waited for our orders to come out, we were served sliced loaves of bread with olive oil for dipping.  There were multiple oil plates so that none of us had to pass them...everyone was able to dip their bread individually.  If you want butter, you will need to request it.  The butter is cold and unseasoned, so if you like salt (and pepper), you will have to request the waitress to bring some to the table and grind it for you (due to Covid measures).

Our group was very pleased.  I'm not one who complains about lunch prices when the quality of service and food options are the same as dinner.  For me, who cares what time it is?  I care about having a dining experience and Catellos provided a nice venue and meal for our group of 6 to gather.  It is a long way from my home southwest of Indy, but I would definitely consider returning with friends for another visit.

If you're looking for a fantastic sandwich, you must check out Pino's. Owners/Operators Jaysen and Logan Desaro opened Pino's in April 2016.  Jaysen is part Filipino and grew up with the nickname ""Pino."" Hence the name of the business. Pino's is a casual space that is tucked away in a strip mall on the corner of Ustick and Five Mile in Boise. 

Pino's Grinders are generous portions of fresh, high-quantity ingredients on homemade bread,  topped with Italian Grinder Sauce (a secret blend of oil, vinegar and special spices) which are then oven-baked. Grinders come in two sizes, 8"" and 16,"" and are served with chips. Jaysen makes the delicious bread from scratch daily.  He also makes the Italian sausage. Logan makes all the soups, using family recipes.

Pino's has 19 Grinders to choose from. They also have a few salads, soup and garlic bread. to choose from.The most popular Grinders are the #6 (Combo & Cheese) #7 (Steak & Cheese) and # 14 (Ham, Roast Beef & Cheese). Reviewers rave about the French Dip, which is #19. All sandwiches are made to order. Pino's prides itself on getting your food out in 10 minutes or less, even during lunch rush. 

For my first visit on 10/7/20, I ordered an 8"" (aka half-size) #6 Combo & Cheese ($7.65). The Combo & Cheese has ham, sausage, salami, mushrooms, onions, green peppers, tomatoes and mayo. I added a cup of Broccoli Cheddar soup ($3.50) The grinder far exceeded my expectations. I knew from reading reviews that Pino's grinders were unexpectedly large. Even so, I did a double-take and asked if I had been served the right sandwich. Yup! Everything about the grinder was perfection, starting with the homemade bread. The inside was pillowy soft, but the outside developed a nice crust under the high heat of the oven, which melted the cheese and warmed, but didn't overcook the meat and veggies. The cheese is a melty mozzarella/Monterey Jack mix. I don't normally like oil and vinegar on my sandwiches, but Pino's grinder sauce really enhanced the ingredients.The soup had great flavor. After polishing off half my grinder, chips and soup, I was full. The next day, the leftover half grinder heated up nicely in the oven. 

For my second visit on 10/13/20, I ordered an 8"" #7 Steak & Cheese ($8.15). The Steak & Cheese has steak, cheese, mushrooms, onions, green peppers, tomatoes and mayo. This time, I asked for all of the ingredients to be heated up on the grill first, which I now know is my preferred way of eating grinders. My second visit was every bit as exceptional as my first period.  

If you need a barometer for how much I love Pino's, it's almost unheard of for me to visit the same restaurant twice in a month, much less twice in the same week. I wanted to return for the third time immediately after trying my second grinder but I held back due to concern my enthusiasm might appear borderline stalker-ish. 

Pino's is located at 10697 W. Ustick Rd.

Gluten-free review:
Before going, I called the restaurant to see what types of accomodations they make for gluten allergies, and they were super knowledgeable. They explained every way they prepare items and when I asked questions about ingredients, they took time to read over labels. They never seemed annoyed or in a hurry. Because this is a new gluten allergy, we weren't sure how well they prevented cross contamination, but we were adamant to keep going. 

When we arrived, we explained the gluten allergy, and I was extremely impressed how knowledgeable the wait staff was. Everyone that we asked knew which ingredients to avoid (imitation crab, tempura, etc), how to make the roll gluten free, and made sure we were happy with everything. They even provide a separate gf soy sauce option for you (and their spicy mayo is only mayo and siracha! Score!)

For those who have a gluten allergy or celiac, just beware that their rice is made with a vinegar mix that has glutamate, but that should be gf. The rice itself doesn't have soy. 

I will definitely be going back. Some of my favorites- nigiri (always fresh!), Mt fuji roll (amazing with smoked fish flakes!), and Mt halla (just check ingredients)! Just steer clear of imitation crab and tempura, and you should be okay! Be sure the soy sauce is left off, too. 

So delicious. Will definitely continue to go regularly now that we know it's a safe restaurant for us!",2021-01-31 21:39:48,334,1599,

The atmosphere is wonderful and thoughtful. Cocktails were fabulous and high quality. Service was spectacular. The menu and pricing were carefully explained in addition to providing us with recommendations. 

We started with the lobster bisque with added lobster meat and hush puppies. I thoroughly enjoyed both - while I think the bisque at $15 was a little steep for the portion size, I would order again. 

Now for the negatives: We also started with some fresh oysters in the half shell. While I appreciated the quality, I couldn't enjoy them as every oyster had several bits of shell in them which obviously ruins the whole experience. 

The mussels were the worst thing we had that evening. Mussels are one of my favorite appetizers at restaurants, usually rich with umami and a comforting dish. These were in a bucket rather that a shallow bowl, meaning as you ate them, you couldn't enjoy any broth or flavor. They were dry and rubbery and the worst mussels I've had.

For our main entrees, we shared a Connecticut lobster roll and a crab roll. The lobster roll had generous amounts of lobster (which it should for the price) but was extremely bland compared to others I've had. The crab roll was inedible however with so much mayonnaise used that we couldn't even enjoy the crab. The chips were good at least. 

All in all, I'm not sure if it was an off night or what, but the recommendations I heard of Peacemaker did not match the experience we had.",2021-01-20 17:42:34,316,1571,

They are all enumerated after his daughter, Camila. I haven't met her, but it is obvious her father takes great pride in her and the success of the enterprise. 

The location is in a small strip center, replacing an earlier pizza/pasta joint that succumbed in the midst of COVID-19 last year (RIP). It is apparent that they have worked hard to freshen up the space with colorful wall murals and end to end cleaning. The people there are friendly and have skills, although the older dude folding boxes in front of the counter couldn't manage to make eye contact. Maybe a language problem. 

So, I ordered by phone rather than GrubHub, to keep the money in their register rather than sharing with a third party. I went with a large pie, half sausage and penne aglio olio with spinach (which came with side salad and small loaf of oven fresh bread). 

The pizza was good, with firm crust and scorch marks across the bottom. The slices held their point when lifted and folded for eating. As they cooled that rigidity waned and dog eared. The crumbled sweet sausage was plentiful, but a bit salty. The other half of the pie was plain, and probably would have been better with a tad less cheese, so the flavor of the tomato sauce and basil could shine through. 

The pasta was not listed on the menu, and I suspected they didn't regularly indulge such preferences. Still, there was plenty of garlic and good taste. Having had the same dish at a different place last week that was over the top with whole fresh spinach leaves sauteed perfectly, this version was light on the finely chopped greens. I won't downgrade as the chef was doing me a favor and may not have had exactly what he needed for the optimal dish. I appreciated the effort. 

Overall, quite decent for a neighborhood Casa Italiana Mexicana.

I am in the service industry and a tough grader when it comes to someone ""doing their job"" in my eyes.  Given the experience I had yesterday with Mike, the owner, I had to make the time to write a review about FH cycles.  I will start by saying that I am from CT and randomly reached out to Mike to see if he had a specific bike that I have been looking for (months of looking and 20 wait lists).  As you know you can't get bikes easily and I was told by many including the bike company that I shouldn't expect it until August. I wanted it for my son's Xmas gift/ or Birthday.  (End of Jan). Mike had just received 2 of them and was willing to hold one for me while I confirmed with my son and husband it was the right bike and then we could make the trip down to pick it up.  (It was about 2.5 hours away). Once confirmed that it was the correct bike, I asked if he would ship it since he was 2.5 hours away.  Mike said that it would be very expensive to ship and he would be willing to meet me so that I didn't have to drive as far.  WOW!!! Was all that went through my head. And then it was so nice I thought this was a scam.  He was willing to ship if I really wanted to but we took him up on his offer and met him the next day.  Again, I was worried there were going to be hidden fees, something. No way can there be a store owner this nice.  He had the bike everyone wanted, why was he helping me get it?!?!   Nope, just a super nice guy wanting to do the right thing for my son's 14th bday.  
The moral of the review is this: here is someone who knew he wasn't going to get a long term regular customer (2.5 hours away) but he went out of his way to be an awesome person!  He wasn't in it for the sale, he is a store owner that cares about the person, his customer.  
Anyone reading this, please go to this store and get your bikes, accessories, services from Mike!!!!  He is a really standout person!

I went in to get an evaluation referred by my dentist for a root canal that did not work. I am bilingual, however I did prefer an interpreter in Spanish to be able to fully understand what was going on with my teeth and to know my treatment options. 

The interpreter was a young female, thin and tall with dark hair. She was incredibly rude and she made racial slurs.

First, I was confused about the process and what the doctor was telling me, so I would ask questions to understand what decision I wanted to make regarding my treatment. The interpreter asked me ""are you an engineer?"" I answered ""no, why?"". She replied ""well because you are acting like an engineer because you are asking so many questions and want to know everything"". 

Second, i would also ask her for any professional recommendations about treatment and she replied ""we cannot tell you what to do it is your own decision. I cant guarantee you it is going to help you because it is like a heart attack, you are never 100% sure"". 

Third, her job was to INTERPRET between myself and the doctor. Instead multiple times i had to ask her to please relay what i was asking or saying to the doctor. Instead she refused to translate and instead would proceed to tell her own opinions.

Lastly and THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON WHY YOU SHOULD NOT GO HERE. She made various racial slurs towards me, simply because I preferred Spanish rather than English. Please be aware that I was nervous throughout the appointment and was being polite the entire time. I asked politely and concerned that if I had the procedure done if I would be able to go to work the following day. She had the audacity to assume i cleaned houses. She said ""well if you had a good desk job then yes you can, but if you are cleaning houses then no you will not be able to"". 

The way that i was treated was simply grotesque. I left feeling disappointed, insulted, offended, and humiliated. Please do NOT go here, you will not feel reassured and you will not be treated professionally. What a shame that they would employ such a person with a lack of professionalism. Those that are hired at this place should be polite, educated, knowledgeable, and overall professional.",2021-01-27 01:08:51,479,2325,

Curiosity Doughnuts are more than just hype.  While the line may be highly inefficient, the quality of these doughnuts are well worth the long wait. 

All the doughnuts are fantastic. We tried to pick as many different types and flavors as we could, but limited ourselves to six doughnuts, as there was only two of us. We ultimately decided on the Chocolate Chip Cookie flavored Potato doughnut, Vanilla Cruller, S'mores flavored Vanilla Doughnut, some flavored Sourdough Doughnut (I can't remember), Triple Chocolate Doughnut, and the Toffee Pudding Vanilla Doughnut (I think... LOL). 

We both loved the potato doughnut and cruller the most. Those two are just so unique and stand out among the others in terms of texture and flavor of the 'doughnut base'. It was also the best cruller I've ever had-- it just melts in your mouth! And overall, the best doughnuts I've had anywhere. The Toffee Pudding and S'mores ones, I could do without, but with a different flavor, would probably be a gamechanger. 

I came here just past 8am on a Saturday, and immediately regretted how casually I had gotten ready that morning LOL. I had read about the long lines and people queueing up at 6-7am, but I thought those days had passed and were merely early hype. Clearly, I was wrong as I took my spot in line that was more than halfway down the block. Rookie mistake. 

They allow one group each, at a time, into the vestibule, doughnut room, and payment/coffee area. Lines move fairly slowly as the doughnut flavors of the day aren't posted online, near the storefront, or even next to the doughnuts, so the attendant has to go through each doughnut type and flavor with each group. No online ordering either. 

They offer 15-20 different doughnuts, so the selection can also feel a little overwhelming, and take indecisive people like me, FOREVER! Luckily, I was with someone whose taste is more discerning than mine. 

Overall, amazing pop-up and a great way to utilize the space as ITV and Laurel are temporarily closed. 

Go get their delicious doughnuts NOW!",2021-01-06 19:50:43,414,2072,

Now for my interaction.. I was here because a certain vehicle peaked my interest I found online. Booked a viewing and went to find it. I arrived early and visually inspected the car. Noticed it had some horrible paint on the front bumper that was cracking. The rest of the car looked fine.. 

So I was placed with a salesman who was great, honest, and new. Took the vehicle for a drive and it was ok seeming. Pulled in the lot and opened the hood to see if there had been any leaks after my drive and it didn't appear so... but I noticed the front bumper reinforcement was bent, some rust forming on the broken sheet metal and some very shotty repairs from what looked like a front end collision. 

So I asked for the car fax report... got the report after a long wait inside. Then the manager came by along with the report (which was odd). He sat down and said right away ""we aren't dropping the price of this vehicle""... I told him it was clearly in an accident and it was substantially damaged and that's not a fair value for a damaged car regardless of what you think. He said he's not budging. I then asked about the accident and what was involved in the repair... oh boy did I ever get a line of lies. You can tell because he was super shifty and didn't want to even discuss it because it made him uncomfortable. He knew he wouldn't sell it for that price to me because of what I know. I said well that's fine, sell the car to someone unsuspecting and see how they feel.

My boyfriend felt ill after a few bites so he stopped eating.  I ordered the Thai one on salad... the glass noodles where so under cooked or old that they were not translucent or soft, the were shaped like the are when they come out of the package and were rubbery and tough, the shrimp were correctly cooked, and the Thai peanut dressing was amazing... but outside of the noodle issue my salad had at least half a red onion in it... my first bite was 80% onion and the second and third weren't much better...

This location is newly remodeled which is nice.  The room was nice and even had a small patio overlooking the pool.  Unfortunately it was way too cold to enjoy either.  You can tell everything was fresh in the room and it included a small microwave and mini fridge.  The shower was very modern.

All the staff were wearing masks as were all the patrons.  But the one thing that was disturbing was the gentlemen that insisted he help us bring our luggage to the room even after we loaded the cart.  We needed no help. We said no but he pretty much bullied his way into bringing it up.  Not sure how good his English was but we told him that once at our room that he could not come in and to leave the luggage outside our door.  Strange given the covid precautions that this guy was even allowed to interact with the customers.  

Not sure if it is the covid cleaning products or some deodorizer they used but the room had scent that bothered us.  Yes we were very near the airport but since they did a major reno the noise of planes taking off was pretty loud with all of the window closed - surprising.

We are wondering if Marriott has changed the benefits for GOLD members but the last three times, during Covid, that we have stayed at Courtyards they don't seem to have any upgraded rooms available (one even said they don't have upgraded rooms?). Nor do they give complimentary waters which they did when it was Starwoods... Perhaps cost cutting given the hit from the pandemic... disappointing!",2021-01-30 00:50:33,333,1703,

This was my first time using this salon and I would not recommend it to anyone. This review is long but it has been one long never-ending trainwreck of an experience. I made an appointment for a Balayage and a Cut and brought in several pictures of what I was looking for, having gotten this exact same hair style done in the past at a different salon. After the five hour session when my hair was blowed out, I realized that the cut was all one length around, instead of the angles and layers I had asked for, and the balayage I had asked for, which should have been blonde all around the tips of my hair, was not at all what I had asked for. Instead, there were highlights throughout my hair, but not the transition to blonde at the bottom of my hair. When it came time to pay, I was charged an extra bottle of color, even though I did not see very much color in my hair. I paid a total of $330 (with tip included) !!! Since it had been 5 hours already and I needed to get home, I left and called back a week later to ask for a redo. I left a message with the receptionist and waited four days and still no call back from the manager. I called again, left another message, and it wasn't until the next day after that that the manager called me back. I explained my request, they said they would do the redo and scheduled me for a few weeks out since there was an impending snow storm and the holidays. Unfortunately I had to again reschedule the redo because of a COVID exposure, so my redo was finally scheduled for a week later. I showed up to the same stylist- explained why I was there. Showed her the picture of what I had asked for in the beginning and that what I had was clearly not it. Her response was that she had told me it was ""impossible"" to get that color because my hair was too dark and that she had told me it would require several sessions to achieve that style. Neither of these are true- I would have remembered if she told me it would take several sessions because I wouldn't have agreed to it, and furthermore, I have gotten this done before in ONE session at a different salon. Then she said this does not count as a ""redo"" as this is an entirely new request. To which I told her it's the exact same request I had asked the first time around.  Instead of being apologetic and understanding, she was defensive from the get go, tried to tell me I did not remember our conversation, and then proceeded to redo the color of my hair, without making eye contact with me nor did she say more than 5 words to me for the rest of the session, making it an extremely uncomfortable experience! Half way through the color re-do, she asked me if I had told the manager the redo would also include fixing the cut. To which I replied, of course- needing angles and layers was the other complaint I had. She told me she would not have time to get to that cause she has someone else coming in so I would have to reschedule another time to come in to get my haircut fixed!!!! No, I do not want to schedule a third time coming back for this haircut! I had made it perfectly clear over three different  phone conversations, and in person when I got there that this cut was not what I asked for. Instead she said her assistant would take over to wash my hair and blow it out. She did get my hair color closer to what I had originally requested, but after this 4 hour session was done, she barely acknowledged me giving her a tip before I walked out the door. Absolutely unprofessional and awkward experience, and very upsetting considering I spent 9 hours total in that salon between the two appointments, paid that much money, and in the end I still dont have the cut I asked for. Needless to say, I will not be rescheduling the cut redo at this place, nor recommending this salon to anyone. The stylist was very nice on the first appointment, and then did a 180 during my redo, making me feel very uncomfortable that I ever asked them to fix it. When you spend that much time and money for a hairstyle, you should get what you asked for! Instead, I had an awkward re-do that was left half finished since she didn't have the time to fix my angles and layers, which also was not my fault as they didn't schedule in sufficient time for the request.  Ridiculous.",2021-01-18 00:07:33,912,4311,

We had just eaten at Slapfish (which by the way offers no dessert options) and my wife said she wanted a good donut but not from a big box store or grocery.  She wanted the ""good"" stuff.  So I remembered The Batter Bowl on my Yelp ""To Try"" collection.  She quickly looked it up for directions when Facebook came up and said they were having a ""Pop-In"" event or something like that and had donuts, cake pops, cookies and and so on.  The pictures appealed to our sweet tooth, so we decided to give them a try out. 

She walked in first and was already ordering things when I walked in.  The lady waiting on her obviously was one of the bakers as well and was describing the various flavors of cake pops as well as all of the cookies available.  My wife was excited to see Mexican Wedding Cookies, she said you can't buy good wedding cookies except at a bakery or make your own at home.  She ordered the Wedding cookies, four of the cake pops, each a different flavor, six glazed donuts and two chocolate chip cookies.  She dug right into the wedding cookies when we got in the car.  She said they were perfect with just the right amount of salt, pecans and powdered sugar! 

She put my name on the donuts so our little greedy guys didn't clean them out before I got a chance.  She let the grandkids try out the cake pops knowing that is their favorite.  I am happy to report the kids gave a big thumbs up to the cake pops.  They were gone in 15 mins after we got home.  Later in the evening they had the chocolate chip cookies.  They were the large thin type of cookies with lots of chocolate chips inside.  The kids gave their stamp of approval for the cookies as well.

I had a donut later that evening and it was fresh with plenty of glaze and hit the spot after dinner.  We will definitely be making this a regular stop.  If you have not tried them or treats from a real bakery in a long time, you need check them out.

I was not aware of ALL of the issues that would arise during my time here and am moving out at the end of my lease. 

1. The walls are paper thin.  I can hear my neighbors talking, opening and shutting cabinets, turning on the water in the bathroom, etc. I can hear all of this when I am in my kitchen, living room, bedroom and bathroom. Also, this apartment is right next to the metro and forest park parkway, so you will hear that all day and night as well since the exterior walls are just as thin as the interior ones. That also leads to having a draft in the apartment coming in from the balcony door and the exterior windows in the living room. 

2. The ventilation is horrible in the building. I live on the top floor and the two residents below me smoke a lot in their apartment (which is not allowed per the leasing agreement) and all of it collects in my apartment since there is no where else for the smoke to go due to the poor ventilation set up. After countless emails and maintenance requests over the course of 5 months, they did not fix the ventilation or speak to the residents causing the issue in the first place. They were very unresponsive to emails over the course of this time and could take weeks or a full month to respond. This is still an active issue and will continue to be an issue for the person who moves into this apartment once my lease is up.

3. There are silverfish everywhere in the building. They will be in your apartment, in the hallways, stair wells, etc. There have been multiple residents that had this pest issue pretty significantly in their apartments. 

For the pros of living here: I have not had a problem with the internet speed at all while working from home, the pool is nice during the summer and not crowded, and the apartments are aesthetically pleasing. 

Overall, there are multiple other luxury apartment complexes in the area for the same price that would be a better choice than this apartment complex.",2021-01-25 23:31:28,422,2085,

Upon arrival was told that type of room was not available. However, they could put me in a smoking room. I couldn't go to another hotel without losing the money that was already pre-paid. The desk clerk was extremely uncooperative. She did not initially offer any alternatives, comps, or discounts to ease my unhappiness with the situation. Eventually was offered a room with a ""soaking tub"". The tub turned out to be a deep tub with smooth bottom and sloped smooth sides. Very slippery/dangerous when entering and leaving the tub. The room also came with a walk-in shower. The shower had a low-flow shower head with almost no pressure that barely wet my hair. Had difficulty removing shampoo and conditioner from my hair. Took me almost 3 times longer than normal to shower and wash my hair. My roommate ended up washing her hair using the faucet in the soaking tub.

Called the front desk to ask for wi-fi access info since it was not supplied at check-in. There was no answer after 14 rings on the telephone. Had to go down to the lobby to get the information.

I was accumulating so many complaints I wanted to write them down. I searched all over the room for paper and pens, but could not find any. Talk about being cheap.

When I lived in St. Louis, I was a three time buyer at their St. Louis Honda. Now that I live in Godfrey, I've switched to their Toyota dealership. I've always been a CRV driver, so flipping over to a RAV4 was easy. 

Once I moved to the small town of Godfrey in Illinois, my 13 year old CRV was ready to be replaced. Being in a new town, I wanted to support a business in my new community and with the Toyota dealership being owned by Mungenast, the decision was easy. 

I knew what I wanted. I had researched the web, shopped the lot and other dealership lots before I went into Alton Toyota to make my purchase. When I arrived, I met with Amber my sales professional. She listened to my wants and most importantly my needs. She showed me the RAV4's that they had on the lot and I test drove a hybrid and a regular RAV4. The hybrid was amazing, but with only a 3 mile drive to work, i choose to go with the regular. 

I liked the features on the one they had, but I was obsessed with the color, Lunar Rock. So obsessed that I wanted my new RAV4 to be that color. At this point, Amber went the extra mile and researched other dealerships and found me what I wanted. I had to wait an extra 10 days so they could get it transferred to Alton, but I got what I wanted and in the color I wanted. 

On the day I picked up my new SUV, Amber had patience while she taught me all about the electronics and features my new ride had. Once she was done teaching this old dog new tricks about his ride, I met with the finance manager. We completed all my paperwork and what impressed me the most, is Alton Toyota is totally full service. They are set up to issue new license plates. When I bought cars in Missouri, I had to go to the DVM to pay my sales tax and to have my new plates issued. Mungenast did it all and made my life easier.

We've had exceptional service and consistent food, every time we've stopped by.  It's really tasty and the quality of their carne asada is superb.  As other Yelpers have said, you can easily grab a quick, hearty meal for the price of a fast food combo.  The wait staff are all friendly and attentive and you feel immediately welcomed when you arrive. This is a family business and that's one reason why I like this place because supporting small, local businesses is essential.  

 My husband LOVES Chile Colorado and is usually disappointed whenever he orders it because most restaurants use poor quality meat that ends up being hard, stringy and too fatty for his taste.  He has ordered this almost every visit now with only one time where he had their Pozole (and he loved that too!) and swears it's the best he's had!  My photos prove it too!  I typically order their carne asada but also love their tacos, enchiladas and machaca.  They have daily food and drink specials, that vary from enchiladas or chicken fajitas and these are all well-priced.  

One tip, I have is to ask for their habanero salsa, if you dare!  It's much spicier than the one that normally comes with their chips.  They also have a medium salsa that I prefer and it's tasty too!

We've rarely eaten out during the pandemic even with outdoor seating because we've been cautious. Since it was the last night before things shut down, we wanted to get out of the house. When we first arrived at Lure we waited 45 minutes to get a table which was completely fine and expected. It was freezing, so we requested a table near a heater and told them we didn't mind waiting longer for it. When we were finally called, we asked for menus because our phones were on low battery and the host refused because that ""would require printing more and takes awhile"". They proceeded to walk us to the back and sat us at a table without a heater although we were right by an empty table with one. The host walked away so fast I couldn't even get a word out. We sat down and the next thing we know a party is being seated at the table with the heater. We tried to get the attention of 3 waiters and we were ignored every time--with one looking directly at us when we called to them. Those 3 waiters also set the food they were bringing out on the wrong table. ALL OF THEM did this. Which caused a ruckus because a bunch of people was trying to get their attention but somehow they couldn't hear anyone that night?? Once we finally got a hold of someone to take us to another table it had been 15 minutes. No one had ever come specifically to our table to take our order. We moved to the front near a heater and it was barely on. I work with the same heaters at my job so I know how they work but I wanted to be polite and have them do it and not mess with their stuff. I asked one person to turn up the heat. They said that was it's highest capability. I knew that was a lie because I have the same ones at my job. So I asked another waiter walking by and they said they couldn't because it was too close to an umbrella. Mind you the umbrella was 4 feet away. The host stand heater was literally touching the umbrella so they just didn't feel like moving it. I ask someone else and they told me they would get someone to do it AND THEN NEVER CAME BACK. If you're going to lie at least all have the same story. Once our waitress finally came to take our order she was pouting and upset. She had menus (which is strange because I thought you had to print them??). Although all this had happened we never got sharp, never raised our voices, and we were very sweet. When she was done taking our order she tried taking our menus but we wanted to keep them so we could order more. She ignored this and said ""well I'm still taking one"". It was PAPER and it had a little drink spilled on it--why would you even need it. Throughout our meal we never saw her, so we were asking other employees for things and we felt bad, but she literally disappeared. It took 20 minutes for us to even get utensils. We spent almost $200 that night so we expected to have at least average service. In the end, we still tipped 22% even with our horrible experience. The food was fine but I couldn't even enjoy it after the horrid service. I'm never going back and I suggest you don't either when things reopen.

This place began in the heart of kennett. A hole in the wall hardly able to fit 30 people, next to what used to be acme. And at that time used to be hands down the best Mexican food in the area... new location requires ALOT. And I get that which is why I haven't put this place to rest until this weekend.


Hard facts. Facts FACTS (from someone who still visited this restaurant 2-3 times a month)

-drinks are now AWFUL. Not handmade anymore and they still charge the same. Call them out and they will make it the way they used to.

-food is sub par for prices. I know a lot of you may like it, but how often do you eat genuine Mexican food portions at any other place are either larger or same size for less $

-caution, order takeout and you're getting he worst of the worst. 

-finally The service has never been great here.. they sold out quality for this outrageous location a long time ago and they're on the decline. 

My recommendation for anyone who is surfing for great cheap Mexican food is the Mexican table, down the road in hockessin. Absolute 4/5 star place. Out dated, but food is outstanding and CHEAP. Drinks are even better and great margs are 5$ 3-6pm every day.. found this hole in the wall after leaving taqueria out of disgust. Servers are incredibly fun and can't help but be interested in your meal.

Update 1/23/2021: I went back to get more cookies. I got the 4-pack. I got two Biscoff Lava Cookies, a Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Cookie, and a Snickerdoodle Cupcake Cookie. Frankly, I had to edit my review down to 3 stars because of this visit. None of the cookies were warm. The Biscoff Lava Cookies do have great flavor, but they were lukewarm here. The Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Cookie was somehow cold. Also, it has zero pumpkin flavor and had way too many chocolate chips. In fact, the cookie was like 70% chocolate chips....This is 0/3 using the description online: 1) 1) ""warm"", 2) ""pumpkin spice cookie"", 3) ""with semi-sweet chocolate chips."" Seriously...cold...zero pumpkin flavor...overwhelmingly (and far from ""semi-"") sweet chocolate chips. Lastly, the Snickdoodle Cupcake Cookie was okay. The cookie had a weird texture: it was airy with a light crisp. I was hoping for a soft, gooey cookie given the ""sugar cookie description."" The cinnamon was a nice touch, and the cream cheese icing was a little better than what I got when I originally ordered the Red Velvet Cookie at my first visit 12/4/2020. This visit was definitely not worth the $15.36 that I paid, and I'd gladly take refund for the false advertising and misleading cookie descriptions.

Update 1/22/2021: A student brought me a Biscoff Lava Cookie. I put it in the microwave for 22 seconds, and it was fantastic. Warm, gooey, yummy. The Biscoff filling in the center was perfectly proportioned.",2021-01-23 21:06:54,314,1483,
_8JBOEgpQT1boBgGcGrikA,UN6MXJuhyGcX7LTj4-b7FA,SZ4lt-1ZQOsQJbTf6CMFRQ,5,12,2,8,"I had a recent and very unpleasant experience at a salon I'd been using (not Naturale) for several months-my credit card number was 'lifted' (for lack of a better term) so I was once again adrift, trying to find a place that was close by, quiet, reasonably priced, fairly in and out time wise yet had an atmosphere that would allow me to relax.

TA DA! Prestige Nail Salon!

Since many hair and nail salons are limiting the number of customers in their space at one time for safety reasons, rather than do a walk in, I called and made an appointment for a standard mani/pedi. When I showed up, I was asked to use the hand sanitizer at the reception desk, my temperature was taken and I was given a brief health form to fill out. There are plexiglass barriers throughout the salon and everyone, operators and clients, was masked.  

The space is clean, airy and inviting. Nothing stood out, there was no effort at trying to impress but everything appeared clean and well maintained. I was led to the back where pedicures are done. Standard spa chairs, safety barriers in place. The pedicure lady was not chatty though she was pleasant and I was thrilled that I did not have to make conversation when all I wanted to do was relax. Don't get me wrong-I am not coming from an 'I'm better than you' place where I think I am above talking to a person performing a service. Not at all. It's always a pleasure to have a good chin wag when I'm out, but for me, when I go for a spa experience, it's because I want an escape, not a bitch or bull session. The operator at the other salon I recently quit would regale me with a constant, unsolicted litany of complaints about her kids, her husband, her father, her former boss and her health, to name just a FEW topics, and as she got deeper into and more focused on her bitching, she would become less present on what she was doing and often cut a toe or a cuticle, then look up at me and say in an accusing tone, 'You're bleeding!'  

Not here. 

Perfect, competent, painless pedicure, no excessive and painful/ticklish scrubbing with pumice, a quick, blissful hot stone massage and color application. I was then taken to the front of the shop for the manicure portion of my visit as my feet were ensconced in a dryer. 

Same treatment by the manicurist. A few polite words from behind a safety barrier, shaping, filing, cuticle care. I complimented her on not taking off too much cuticle and shared a bit about my prior experience. She said she only took off 'what needed to come off, no digging too deep.' I was asked to pay before the polish was applied (sensible) and took the time to thank and tip both the manicurist and the pedicurist. Nails were expertly and neatly polished and I was left to quietly dry my finger and toe nails in sweet peace. 

There was soft music playing, nothing I can remember (a good sign) and even with other patrons receiving services, the salon was blessedly quiet and I was free to have a much needed Uncontrolled Zone.

Drying time included, I was in and out in just over 60 minutes which is a far cry from the 3 to 4 hours I used to have to endure at the other salon for a basic mani/pedi. 

If you are looking for a clean, safe, well run nail salon that can offer hospitable, professional, quick full service without making you feel like you're part of an assembly line, look no further than Prestige. I will be back-again and again.

Cash and credit cards accepted-tips are to be in cash and for your convenience, there is an ATM by the reception desk.",2021-01-15 19:47:44,744,3531,

Being a Hilton Honors Diamond member I have stayed at my fair share of Hilton Hotels. I have traveled during this Pandemic as well, and I must say this hotel is poorly ran. Let's just go over a few things we came across while staying there.

3 bedroom Suite, 1 King Room, 2 Queen Room.

When you check in on the app, it ask you what time is your expected arrival, so I put 3pm, knowing we would arrive around then. We arrived around 3:10pm to find the room was not ready.    The room became ready around 4pm. Well at least we thought it was ready. Upon entering the room there was a horrible stinch coming from the garbage disposal and the refrigerator. We couldn't move rooms because the other room wasn't ready yet. So we had to go purchase some cleaning products, to poor down the drain and clean the fridge. When we told the front desk they gave us a small dishwashing liquid. That was Friday.

Saturday morning go down for some towels and trash bags. So we can sit old towels & trash outside our door. Of course they have no towels at 8am?? I get 4 pool towels. Well later on in the day we go back down around 5pm, because we want to shower again and we're denied towels, we were told we have to bring back old towels to get new ones? That's not what I was told during check-in. At check in we were told to leave told towels and trash outside the room and housekeeping would pick them. Well on Sunday upon Check out the front door to our room was full of 2 days worth of trash and towels - just disgusting.

TOILET PAPER - How does a hotel run out of toilet paper. Neither room had full rolls of toilet paper upon arrival. When we asked the front desk for toilet paper we were only given one roll. So we had to run to the store and buy toilet paper for the room. The hotel should be embarrassed. A holiday weekend, you should have extra staff if need be, you should have ample supply of cleaning supplies and toilet paper at least.

And then on Sunday morning we get a call about being loud when it wasn't even our room- it was coming from the third floor. But because we were a small group of ethnic women- they assumed it was us?? What the heck? The room above us sounded like they were hearding elephants all night long. So the fact the front desk called our room at 2:30am, was a joke!

Sunday we just used our old towels because we were told no more towels for our room. let me remind you we Got into the room late, but come Sunday morning right at 11 o'clock they were making sure we were checking out. I have never seen a hotel rush their guest out of their room, but with this hotel in this management I'm not one bit surprised. 

I hope this review helps someone else.",2021-01-04 22:23:11,588,2732,

I do my bulk shopping at Sam's Club, so was glad to go so I could compare the two. 
This BJ'S is located on Red Lion Road , a few blocks off of Roosevelt Boulevard in Northeast Pa. They have plenty of parking and practice social distancing protocols.
I was anxious to get my own cart and leave my friend so I could explore on my own. She didn't mind because she wanted to do the same thing. 
First thing I noticed was they carry a lot of things that Sam's Club doesn't.  Some brand names I would find in the regular grocery store. The prices  are comparatively the same (give or take a few cents). They also have a deli counter (which my Sam's Club does not).
Not sure if it was a fluke or not, but they were well stocked with Lysol spray, wipes, toilet paper and paper towels! 
I windup spending more than my friend ( and I was just supposed to have just been her ride).
Everybody was very friendly from the security guard, to the cashier. 
Conclusion.....I would definitely go back, because I liked some of the new products that I bought and they were well stocked.
One thing though! Two of the pastries I bought (danishes and croissants) were terrible! Dry and tasteless! Had to throw them out :(  Sam's Club beats them hands down in that department. 
Still love my Sam's Club, but will stop in BJ'S as well, every now and then.",2021-01-16 23:55:26,325,1454,

Made a lot of promises. Told me they come out quarterly to do the treatments. Set up a customer portal where I can see my contract, billing, etc. Sounds great? NOT!! First of all, nobody in my community is using them except for me.  Second, quarterly means 4 times a year. They were coming every 2 months. Third, save a hard copy of your contract. I didn't because I initially saw it in my customer portal . It magically disappeared later on when I am having a dispute with them.  Fourth, not very trustworthy. According to my customer portal, they have service dates up to two years even though I sign up for a ONE year contract. Fifth, horrible customer services. Tried to call them on numerous occasions to resolve my issues. Nobody picks up the phone!  At one point, I waited over 1 hour and 40 minutes to speak to a representative, but had to give up and email the company instead. Ironically, when trying to reach a sales representative, my phone was answered within 5 mins. The sales representative stated that they can't do anything, and quickly transferred to another line. This kept on going till I gave up and wrote an email to their company, formally asking them to terminate my contract. Three weeks later, they send me a bill of $200 (Initial Discount Reimbursement). To sum it up, save your money and don't fall for their tricks.",2021-01-05 01:04:07,319,1503,

All of these services are offered at this location which was great. Our experience the other day was unfortunately not the best. Typically during the current lock down, businesses will limit the number of people inside their space. When we arrived, there were approximately 5 people which we thought was acceptable - all wore masks and distancing seemed to be achievable. Once we got to the counter, we noticed that there was a plexiglass barrier between us and the employee as is now common. There was however no barrier between us and the person at the next wicket which was barely 2 meters away. This added measure could add an additional sense of security for their customers. My wife was able to get her license and had to remove her mask for the photo. This portion of our experience means that while her mask was off indoors that she was potentially exposed to any Covid germs that could have been present. It would be nice if the picture taking could be done inside a air scrubbed booth or something in order to keep the risk of exposure to it's lowest and offer a semblance of safety to the person required to remove their mask. Finally, when we left there were well over a dozen people in the space and it was looking pretty crowded with much less social distancing being possible. All this business needed to do was have a sign on the door limiting the number of people inside to the number of staff able to serve them or some other scheme to promote the safety of all. The weather has been nice in Edmonton and other businesses have people line up out doors. We feel that this business did not fully grasp the seriousness of the situation and could have done a better job.",2021-01-08 13:49:17,351,1816,
xsNzKr0tjHzRvsa_99HPUQ,NKRgQwaKNbRXXSj2Nf9YLw,VkAhWzmhMTCQDMoedhI8Vg,2,10,0,0,"I've been here twice. The first was for a safety recall for the passenger side airbag, which went from free to $1500 when Toyota performed their however-many-point inspection and advised my car requiring the following: 

- Service battery (corrosion on bracket)
- Replace Intake Manifold Gaskets (leaking and debris buildup)
- Replace all motor/transmission mounts (hardened and transferring - excessive vibrations, dry cracking present)
- Replace rear windshield wiper insert (torn)
- Replace right rear license plate bulb
- Replace 3rd eye brake light bulb 
- Polish headlamps
- Oil change

I don't know if I got scammed for the above issues fixed for $1500, so I won't address that. The nice thing was Toyota provided me with a rental car, but when I returned to pick up my car, I discovered they forgot to do the oil change. Due to time constraints on my end, a manager handwrote a note for a ""free"" oil change at the next service, because I'd already paid for the service but didn't receive it. 

Isn't there a checklist of tasks for each car that's there for servicing? If not, shouldn't there be? How do you forget an oil change? By not reading? 

Also, the right thing would've been issuing a refund on the oil change as opposed to a promise to perform the service in the future. So y'all make the mistake and then place the burden on the recipient of said mistake to follow up on it in order to be made whole, instead of making it right then and there. SURE. REALLY PROFESSIONAL. 

Well, fast forward to the future when I decided to collect on my oil change. I made an appointment online, but I feel like those appointments are only to reserve your entitlement to be seen that day, and not any adherence to the time of the actual appointment. 

Upon arrival, there are about 20 employees working at both sides of the dealership, but it literally took 5 minutes for someone to come over and check us in. Then, after waving around this handwritten paper promise that I thankfully didn't lose and having to explain the situation, it took TWO AND A HALF HOURS to get ONE single oil change done. On a Toyota Matrix. 

Our mechanic in the Bay Area literally took 15 minutes. He lifted the car up, drained the old oil, checked the underside of the car and tires, brought the car back down, put new oil in with Marvel mystery oil, topped up the wiper fluid, et voila, I'd be out of there. 

2.5 hours???!?!! Yo, I have THINGS to do! I bill my time in tenths of an hour (EVERY SIX MINUTES) and sometimes, this time has to be further justified to my client. 

Any legit justification for why it would take 2.5 hours for an oil change at Toyota, and this is after following up on the status of the car 3 different times? NO. Office guy blames the ""disconnect"" in communication with the service guy. I'm sorry, but what possible disconnect can there be with ""do this oil change"" and ""ok, it's done"" in a reasonable amount of time? 

Lastly, the alleged internal ""disconnect"" should not be the client's burden to bear, but clearly an internal problem that needs to be handled by management. Why are there so many employees there, if things are handled at a snail's pace? There needs to be a complete overhaul in efficiency at that dealership.",2021-01-10 23:09:38,684,3238,

I called ahead of time and was unable to put a reservation via phone (ok I get it). I asked what the wait was and, granted, I didn't provide the size of the party but was told it was 20 minutes.  (I was 1 minute away) Upon arrival, I asked to put my name, the wait suddenly jumped to 35 minutes. ( fine it was a big party, 5 adults, 2 children). I provided my number and the wait began. 45 minutes later: I walked up to the hostess to ask where we were in line and she said ""I can't ask people to get up and leave, we only have so many tables that can sit 7"". I was annoyed and walked away, came back 5 minutes later and asked another hostess who was polite enough to ask if we could squeeze into a smaller table, I said ""of course"" and she proceeded to confirm with the first hostess is asked. She rolled her eye at me and said ""that's fine.""

Finally sat down after 55 minutes and waited 10 minutes before a server came to the table. Once he did we placed the order for the kids (4 and 2) with the drinks and appetizers. 30-40 minutes later, no appetizers but rather, we got our main courses.

I was told by my salesperson it would probably take a few weeks for them to be finished and I would receive notification once they arrived and I could pick up at anytime during business hours but had to make an appointment to have them adjusted, which was fine. After 3 weeks I called to see if both pairs were available being that the email I had received only gave me info on the 2nd pair and I only received notification that the 2nd was ready. Went downhill from there; 1st the hours of operation online are incorrect and I wasted time trying to call when they were closed second Chris who did eventually answer my call was rude. I told him I wanted to see if both pairs were available and he was all ""well did you get notified"" I said I only got notification for the 2nd and I had 2 pair and when I tried looking on the ""progress "" online I only see the 2nd pair. He said he was looking said there was only  1 pair then said ""no wait there's 2"". I said great I would like to make appointment to get them adjusted which he sighed heavily and said I only have tomorrow- no times given or asking if I what time would be best or providing the time available. I said okay do you have anything in the evening and we got an appointment made. When I went to my appointment ""which I had to leave work early for"" I had to wait outside being the gate was closed. The lady who assist the optometrist was extremely nice by the way and explained they were short staffed but would help ASAP and I was like almost 10 mins early and said it was fine. A guy eventually came to gate ""not the door"" and said my glasses were shipped (guy was same guy I talked to on the phone). I said ""excuse me but why?"" and he said ""I don't know there not here she shipped them"". I said I called yesterday and was told they were here and I didn't ask for them to be shipped and no one called me to ask or inform me. He said"" yeah I have you on here and made the appointment"" and he said "" I don't why but she shipped them"". He repeated ""she"" had them shipped a few times. So tell me why I made an appointment to get my glasses adjusted and was told they were there and I get home to a package at my door the same night? No this was not overnight delivery but ups ground. And to top it off when I looked at receipts and info given when I bought them I was also overcharged for the second pair! If I could give the optometrist and his assistant 5 stars I would they were great. I went here because they are open late and have a large selection but ended up being ripped off and lied too and wasting my time and even given a real apology. He just gave a lame sorry and she had them shipped. Well maybe they should find why it happened and actually a sincere apology and maybe take some accountability for giving me false information and wouldn't be on here writing a long review.",2021-01-15 03:11:22,650,3032,

You feed your cravings and treat yourself to breakfast! Capri is a ways from the Boise Airport but worth the time if you're in the mood for a greasy, old-fashioned diner meal. 

This is the original location. You can't miss the building. On top of the sign sits a big old rooster overlooking the cityscape. A large poster on the awning reads ""Famous Biscuits and Gravy,"" so naturally that's what I ordered the moment I sat at the bar. And yes, you gotta get it Loaded (fresh baked buttermilk biscuits, country sausage gravy, topped with crispy bacon, fresh cut green onions and cheddar cheese, $8.95/half order). The food came out super quick - not that B&G ever takes long. The smell of bacon and hot gravy had my mouth watering the second it was placed in front of me. There was so much gravy. Personally, I think B&G should be more G&B. There was a generous amount of chopped bacon, which made up for the insane lack of sausage in the gravy. I wish there was a little more cheese, with how much was on my plate I wouldn't have noticed if it was there or not. The green onions were a delicious addition, albeit a bit strong, so be prepared and okay for onion breath the rest of the day. Generous portion sizes, too. I ended eating half my plate and taking the rest to my husband at home. 

The service was excellent. When I eat outside alone I like to keep to myself by reading articles on my phone and the waitstaff understood.

The pop-up started at 8am, on one of the very first really cold days of the year. My husband and I arrived around 8:15 to a line that snaked down the block. We took our place in line and hoped we wore warm enough clothing (spoiler alert: we didn't). 

We waited in line for well over an hour. I am not that girl who waits in line for specialty food products; I still don't know what possessed me to that day... Though I suspect my alcohol-free November had something to do with it. My sweet tooth rages when I'm on dry island and doughnuts are a weakness. Okay, now we know. 

As we got close to the door, it was pretty evident through the window that pickings were getting very slim. Once inside, we didn't have much of a choice; we ended up with a box of six doughnuts, most of them flavors that I wouldn't have picked had I had more options. That said, I was thrilled to have any doughnuts at all; they were completely sold out after one or two more customers went in after us. I would have been crushed if I had been in that line still! 

At home, the doughnuts were incredible. The insides remind me of a Market Day Canelé (this is a very good thing - Philadelphians, get after it if you haven't had one before!). The exterior had a perfect crunch. Some of the fruity glazes weren't my thing, but the doughnut itself was a work of art.

The video that was posted on the popular social media platform contained footage of a 1 1/2 year old who managed to get inside a walker himself, with the video having the caption of ""So tired of this kid's mullet,"" followed by another caption reading ""look at this dumb***."" The video itself was explicit however. As the former teacher in that room who also was close to this child, I was saddened and shocked to see such a vulgar video posted by a current childcare worker there. Having made close connections with the other current and former employees there, I was quick to contact them to see if they had seen it as well. One current and one former employee saw it and expressed their anger and disbelief towards it, within our conversation discussing how to go about it. Unfortunately, Kids Kampus hasn't created a space to effectively communicate and resolve these types of issues, due to close ties between management and employees. Seeing this Snapchat video made me so disappointed, because the teacher who posted it is a mother herself. It made me wonder, how would she react if her child was being talked about like that by their teacher? Because of my time at Kids Kampus, I knew the mother of the child in this video had been a long term parent there. As a loyal customer, I couldn't imagine how she would react if she'd seen it and how she would feel. Clearly, there is no evidence in this review to prove its worthiness, besides the fact that myself, another former employee, and a current employee had seen it. The next day, I communicated with the current employee who'd seen it, and was told that another current employee had seen it and expressed anger towards it. To my knowledge, no one has come forward and told those in charge, due to the lack of security of a comfortable work space. This has been a problem for a long time now, and one of the main reasons I had to part ways with Kids Kampus. Because of the close ties between management and employees, exceptions have been made for bad behavior for some, and not for others. The unfair treatment and special handouts to certain employees creates an uncomfortable work environment for everyone else, and makes it impossible to be honest to management when there is a problem with another employee. This includes situations mentioned above, that should not be tolerated or taken lightly by anyone who works at this facility. 

I never wanted to have to create a disappointing review, even despite other negative experiences working there. But this was unacceptable and I couldn't be okay not saying anything about it. Generally, the majority of the staff there is kind and does well with the children.

I had booked my appointment for hi-lights like I have gotten the past 7 years and when I got there my stylist suggested balayage instead (shocking, more expensive). I know that I had a decent sized root when going in to my appointment (5 months), but I, for the last 7 years have had my hair hilighted with a 4-6 month root so that it can grow between bleaches. This is why I thought balayage would be a good idea for me. My stylist had a great technique and I was SO excited the entire time to have that beautiful balayage hair you see online. I am pretty sure that the dryers did not get near warm enough to properly lighten my roots to the level of the rest of my hair, so instead my toner was left on for WAY too long to lift the bleach, like it was hurting my scalp. ALL of my roots turned completely orange and then my stylist said she did that to blend it better. It looks horrible. She said it would fade but now after a month and using purple shampoo it is still very very orange and now my actual roots are starting to grow in and there's a huge color difference and it does not look balayaged or blended or nice whatsoever. It's disappointing because the blonde is beautiful and she did a good job with the actual balayage. But it completely defeats the purpose of a balayage if your roots are nowhere near your natural color and you end up with like 3 colors of hair. I am just sad and disappointed because this was the most money I've ever paid to get my hair done. I thought I deserved to splurge and treat myself for once. But I ended up never hating my hair worse in my life.",2021-01-21 06:15:36,346,1646,

The building on the outside is pretty cozy and easy on the eyes. The inside looks like a typical American style restaurant but they have a bar area and poker machines for anyone above the age of 21. The men's bathroom does not have a changing table for babies. They offer plenty of table space and even have two tables for when and if you have more than four people in your party. There are no booths but they include round and square tables and you can usually sit where you want and some views are window views. 

The staff was very friendly and were willing to be helpful with recommendations. They provide menus but they are cleaned in between individuals. 

I tried their Cajun Chicken sandwich and was pretty impressed with the quality of the food. The restaurant had good quality chicken and they ask how you want it dressed. You are provided an option for your side or sides. You can also add on cheese if you desire. The waitress walked me through my order and I enjoyed it more with that desire to help me. The food was nice and hot when received. It tasted good and there was no crisp issues with the lettuce or fries. 

I would recommend it. It was a good experience and the food was amazing. All the employees wore masks and they stayed just far enough away from you to make you comfortable. We were seated immediately and it didn't take long for drinks or food to come out. The staff was friendly and helpful. There was plenty of room away from other dinners and we were there during dinner hours. I am recommending it but it is in an awkward spot to drive to.

It was super dirty, it was INFESTED WITH ROACHES, the shower wouldn't drain. The price is outrageous for the quality. I will never rent here again due to incompetence of the staff and the upkeep of the property. I had to pay a high deposit due to lack of proof that I had rented in the last year. I rented from a property out of state which had switched management companies so they didn't have proof that I lived there for some reason. I asked the front office if I could use my lease agreement from them as proof and I was told no as it is not valid. How is it not valid??? Then a month after I move in I get three calls from the front office saying my lease is over and if I wanted to renew. I signed a 12 month lease, I had only been here a month, how would my lease had been over. They don't have their ducks in a row, clearly. I'm paying 750 for a 500 sq ft place, with no upgrades. The pool is always cloudy and disgusting. The laundry room smells like dead animal and there's always dog poop everywhere. You walk outside and it wreaks of dog poop. The trash area is constantly a mess. My maintenance requests are never answered. I have to call the office to submit a request instead of using the online portal then the front office staff is annoyed because I called. I am not a picky person but this place is a joke.

I've lived on the bottom floor before and you can hear your upstairs neighbor but it literally sounds like he's throwing a bowling ball around up there.

Peruvian Yuca: WOW these yuca ""fries"" were amazing. They had aji amarillo, castletrevano olives, fried capers, and cilantro. The flavors all went together really well. The yuca was crispy. I would totally get these again and I'm not sharing next time!

Spanish Rice: They gave us 2 huge containers of this rice for the dinner combo so the portion was huge! That was a nice surprise. The rice had an excellent flavor and didn't even need any salsa or sour cream. Though I did put some on my fajita taco which was great.

Philly Steak Empanadas: Ignore how orange these look in the photo, that's how my flash made them look since we couldn't wait and ate them in the car lol. These are SO GOOD. I would highly recommend getting the full appetizer order since you only get 2 with the dinner combo. 

Sweet Plantains: Delicious sweet plantains cooked perfectly. They were almost caramelized on the outside. The insides have a slight banana flavor but are a little sweeter. We got 6 plantains with the dinner combo.

Blackened Chick'n Fajita Tacos: Tastes so similar to real chicken, and the flavors are fantastic. It was lacking a little bit on the fillings, so I embellished it with rice, sour cream and salsa. The flour tortilla was okay, it got a little soggy in the takeout container, but it tasted fresh. You get 2 in the dinner combo. 

Buffalo Cauliflower Tacos: While the fajita tacos were lacking, these were overstuffed! The cauliflower stayed crispy even in the takeout container, and they were very flavorful. The black beans and guac were an interesting but welcome addition. I would get these again. You get 2 in the dinner combo.",2021-01-20 18:28:57,385,1849,

My first couple appointments went well and I left with what I wanted. I have a LOT of hair which takes a while to process to blonde which I shared when making my first appointments. When the next client was there while mine was still being done I understood and felt bad but they were kind and handled it well. After 4 or 5 appointments and this still happening but them no longer being kind about it and instead being clearly rushed I have gotten sick of. They KNOW my hair takes a long time. I have always paid the extra charges for long hair and extra product and tipped more than 25%. The final straw this time was the stylist clearly being super rushed, not making any conversation (so awkward), and definitely not processing my highlights fully. She put a toner on and left for so long....just slapped it on and left it to cover the awfully yellow highlights she gave me. The first thing my mom and boyfriend both said were ""wow you left it really dark this time"" no I did not chose that she just didn't feel like actually foiling all my hair like she used to. Won't be coming back. I shouldn't feel bad for having a lot of hair when they are fully aware when I am scheduling how long it takes since I have been there many times.

The inside of the restaurant immediately just gives you a homey-neighborhood vibe (and not the vibe where you feel like you have to be a local to eat there.) Nice bar seating, TVs, and random assortments of like antique figurines - just a cool/laid-back/old school feel. 

The service was friendly and helpful. 

Their menu is somewhat limiting (I always have this perspective since my wife is a vegetarian,) but they are good at what they are known for...burgers and pierogies. 

I wanted to try something different, so I had their ""Lee Highway to Hell"" Burger (homage to lehigh ave.) because I was really intrigued that the bun was swapped for Stocks pound cake (shout out to Stocks.) The flavor for this burger was phenomenal - a big mix of sweet and savory. It comes topped with strips of bacon and coated with cheddar cheese, and a syrup to drip it all in. The only downside to this burger is that it is really hard to eat - it was a mess, but that didn't take away from my overall experience.

My wife got their grilled cheese, which may not seem like much, but they killed this! Thick bread, cooked all the way through, and we got it with a side of their spicy fry sauce - slammin (this sauce competes with any spicy/tangy/aioli dipping sauce I've ever had.

Their pierogies were really good too - we got the cheddar jalapeno. The peppers were not too hot, so very manageable for anyone who is scared of spice, but these were just hard to eat as well. With the peppers on top...I almost wish the pierogies were made with the peppers inside the mix to get an even jalapeno flavor throughout. 

If you are looking to a solid, affordable meal for the weekend or just picking something up last minute during the week - you can't go wrong here.

the egg rolls tasted like the frozen kind. the veggies inside were congealed and odd. the sauce tasted bottled. it was sticky and thick, and not sweet. the thai tea tasted like milk, not rich and creamy like i'm used to.  I didn't even finish it. my mom was flabbergasted- she's never seen me not finish a thai tea in my life. 
even the soy sauce is not kikkoman and I know that seems like a small thing, but the cheap kind they bought to cut costs just doesn't taste as good. 

the ramen was delicious, which is why they are getting the stars i'm giving. the broth was rich and creamy (I got creamy chicken) and the chicken was delicious and well cooked inside. I also enjoyed the soy sauce eggs- they were salty with lots of flavor. it was an all around winner in my book. 

my mom got the orange chicken. again, very little flavor. it was cheap chicken and tasted gamey. the sauce was bottled and had no flavor. the portion was HUGE though, ridiculously huge. i'd rather they have less but used better chicken like the kind in the ramen and got better sauce.

Long version:  I'm extremely displeased in every way with this restaurant . . . from the service to the food.  First, I wanted tofu instead of beef in a dish and they wanted to upcharge $4.  While it's listed on the menu that tofu is $4 if you want that added, I wanted it in place of the beef but they still wanted $4 more for tofu in place of the beef.  Do you know how much tofu is at the grocery store as compared to beef??  The woman who took my order said tofu is very expense.  Guess what?  It's NOT!  I can get organic tofu for less than $3 for a pound (a pound!)  I can guarantee there was no more than 6 ounces of tofu in my dish, and that's being generous.  I don't know anywhere you can get beef for that price and if you can, I certainly wouldn't want to eat it.  Since they weren't going to replace the tofu with the beef at the same price, I decided to add tofu in addition to the beef.  Guess how much beef there was? Four bite size pieces (maybe 2 ounces??). Really? Anyway, my son got the Ra's Men with chicken.  It was awful.  It tasted so odd.  We all tried it and wound up throwing it away.  In addition to that, the chicken was all dark meat.   They also told me 45-50 minutes for our order (3 entrees and 2 apps) and it was OVER an hour and 15 minutes.  They had 2 tables inside that already had their food and about 6 people waiting for their to-go orders, many of whom were complaining about how long it was taking for their food.  How can you be SO far off for how long food will be ready???  My family was in the restaurant business and I get all the challenges, but these should not be any of them.

I bought that two-year-old pair of glasses at a local VisionWorks in Springfield (Delaware County), PA and went back for this prescription lens change.  A recent pair of glasses and lenses from VisionWorks cost me around $400 with everything (non-glare, scratch resistance coating, etc.)--I accepted that, but didn't want to pay that cost again.  For just having a pair of PLAIN bifocal lenses--with the new prescription--inserted into that two-year-old frame I was quoted the price of $283; I was told that was a 25% discount!   I walked out and called around. 
                         
I went in person to Target first, but they were similar in price to VisionWorks' discount; so much for Target being inexpensive!  

Over the phone, For Eyes, at 459 W. Germantown Ave., Plymouth Meeting, PA (across from Plymouth Meeting Mall), assured me that their cost would be under $200--worth the trip up Rte. 495.

While its a bit of a drive, I thought it would be what I was looking for. Needless to say Ken proved me wrong the other day when I was in to get my haircut. Mind you now, I'm an older retired guy with little hair on my head. It usually takes them less than 15 minutes to cut my hair. Before the Covid shut down happened, Ken charged $14.00 for a hair cut but only charged me $12.00. After he opened back up (I didn't know he was shut down) he raised his price to $18.00 (roughly a 25% increase). When I went in, he cut my hair and said he was only going to charge me $14.00, I thought that was fair enough and gave him a twenty dollar bill and said keep the change I'm glad your back, maybe this will help you recover a little bit. I was back a couple of other times trying to support him as he's just a mom & pop business. Two days ago (Thursday) I stopped by for a hair cut and the sign on the window said they were closed as they were out to lunch. No big deal, I wasn't going to sit there for an hour but then again I didn't want to make the 10 mile drive home and have to come back but I did just so I didn't have to go to another place. Like I said in the beginning, I like to support the little guy. After Ken cut my hair, I gave him a twenty dollar bill and he proceeded to give me $2.00 in change. I asked if he raised his price again and he said yes, that he had to when he opened back up and had a tax increase. I let him know that I'd been in for a haircut several times since that happened and was charged $14.00. He said ""no"" that it's been $18.00 all along. Not wanting to make a scene in front of his other customers, I took my change and left. As I opened the door, he said something about coming back. My response was, I doubt that that it will happen. Ken, I know you have to increase your prices but a 25% increase at one time is quite a large increase (especially for less than 15 minutes of work). You told me I should talk with the mayor about this as he's the one that raised his taxes, Ken, thats not my job! I'm a retired old guy on a fixed income that was trying to support you. Who do I talk to about more money so I can afford to pay for an increase from my barber? 

As a past store owner years ago, I'm quite familiar with overhead, I'm even more aware that it's hard enough to get customers in the store the first time but even harder to keep them coming back. Once they have a bad experience, its highly unlikely you'll see them again.

So for what it's worth, take my advice and when someone tells you that they paid less for a haircut, believe them. You might just be able to keep him as a returning customer. I wasn't looking to take advantage of you, you're the one that said I only had to pay $14.00! Think. about everything I've said before you have to close your doors due to not enough customers walking in (I hope that doesn't happen)
 as you two seemed to be pretty good guys but you burned a bridge the other day and I don't forget things easily. Good Luck. I won't be coming back anytime soon!",2021-01-16 17:37:17,731,3162,

The ambience is cozy with its multiple fireplaces and dimly lit dining area. I was impressed by their COVID precautions, social distancing was actually enforced and tables were sanitized and noted upon arrival. Menu is very extensive and can be overwhelming, but the server did a great job explaining everything. Anything can be customized and accommodated to your preferences! 

For starters:
The peel and eat shrimp is served like cocktail shrimp, except the shrimp is seasoned and easy to peel. The caper aioli was a nice dip for the shrimp, which I preferred over the generic cocktail sauce. 
The crab beignets were good. The texture is consistent of a beignet - crispy on the outside and soft in the inside. They kinda reminded me of wannabe crab cakes that don't have much crab meat and bite. 
Crispy brussels were flavorful. The bacon really elevated the common starter. 

For entrees:
The seared scallops with the butternut squash risotto is a light elegant dish. Scallops were cooked perfectly. However, the butternut squash were undercooked and tasted crunchy. That's not something I would like in a creamy risotto. 
The wagyu skirt steak was ordered pink, but was disappointed by how tough and chewy it came out. I've had better wagyu skirt steaks that were cooked more properly and were easier to eat. 
The double cut pork chop was the star of the dinner. The pork chop was a massive size, but was cooked very well - moist and well seasoned. The sweetness of the peaches complimented the savory pork chop nicely. I would recommend the pork chop if you're hungry because it is big! 

Service was okay - great and attentive at the beginning, but dwindled down to a less attentive service at the end of the meal. There are a lot of great foods on the big menu, I would definitely return to try others.",2021-01-17 00:36:29,367,1872,

Those of us who remember the Sea Market were hoping that Widow Fletcher's would bring some of that back to the NPR restaurant scene. it doesn't, not in any way.
The menu is unimaginative with a very poor offering of seafood items for a place on the water. Overall, little thought seems to have gone into the menu.
We were a party of four, two of us had burgers (due, in part, to a lack of options) while two had salads. My wife's Caesar salad came with bland, tasteless chicken, not the blackened chicken as ordered. The salad was very ordinary with no imagination in its composure...it was just a salad, an $11.00 pile of greens with some croutons and bland chicken. 
The burgers were good, but you can find several restaurants locally with much better burgers. The fries on both burger plates were pretty much cold with no hint of crispness. No signature burger on the menu, either.
The restaurant has no theme, boring decor, terrible menu, terrible customer service (our first server, yes, they switched servers in the middle, after we'd ordered) couldn't have been less focused on our needs; while her replacement was better she was still nothing special. The servers apparently dress however they like, and not in a good way.
The menu had Paisano Sandwiches as an offering...I'm confused. Was the Widow Fletcher of Italian descent? Yet another idea that doesn't add to the restaurant's ""theme"".

My wife and I just celebrated our 30th anniversary here 3 months ago and that visit was a 5 out of 5. Unfortunately all good things must end and this place has ended. 

When we were first seated, the check from the previous customer was still on the table along with what appeared to be a grease spot or two. The hostess didn't seem to notice. I used a sanitizing wipe from my pocket and the hostess stood there watching me...In a pandemic, this is intolerable. 

My wife and I chose to split the 16 oz prime rib and our son ordered the salmon. Angel was our server and seemed great, until 20 minutes had passed without our drinks being refilled. The busboy picked up her slack, earning him a $20 tip from me, and took drink order #2. Dinner arrived before drink #2. The order was backwards, with the salmon being separated and the prime rib being served solo. About 10 mins later we finally had a second plate, no thanks to Angel. She showed about about 35 mins after delivering our first round of drinks and before we'd had a chance to taste our food. She took drink order #3 which was never delivered. She appeared one more time, about 20 mins after her last appearance and seemed to ignore the fact that our plates both had the entire prime rib uneaten. 

She asked what was wrong, we told her about the prime rib being VERY tough and her disappearance being unacceptable. Her response- ""let me bring you the check."" Are you kidding me? We waited until 8:30 at night to eat dinner in your stupid restaurant, got served $60 a person garbage, and you don't even ask if you can bring us something to eat? Ok, I'll deal with it...until it took her another 15 mins to get the check. If you don't want to feed me food worth eating- at least get me the F'ing check quickly so I can go eat elsewhere. 

My wife has a bleeding heart and forced me to leave her a tip despite the non-existent service. I gladly handed our busboy $20 and told him not to share it because he worked hard. The sad part is- I say staff standing around throughout our meal and 50% of the tables were blocked off so it's not because they were busy. 

Dear management - SHAME on you for ruining the best restaurant in Indy by hiring morons for service staff and cooks. I have never said this in a review before- but the staff responsible for this should be fired immediately. Destroying the reputation of one of the top restaurants in the Midwest is no joke and they should be terminated before their lousy service poisons the rest of the staff.

Dear Chef- since you clearly have no clue when asparagus season is, you can buy fresh and tender asparagus from Southern California from January through April. Fresh asparagus means that amazing seasoning and prep work isn't wasted on really tough and fibrous vegetable. However, given the prime rib- perhaps you intended to serve a sampling of well seasoned, but tough foods? The truffle Mac was excellent as always, salmon was perfectly cooked, ancient grains were good (albeit a tired idea) and the mashed potatoes were ok. 

Look folks, if this was just me- I'd say grumpy old man syndrome explains it. But looking back at reviews from the last two years, the warning signs were all there. This isn't the first time you served tough prime rib, poor quality sides, or told customers that you had failed to order enough lobster to offer it (this is a majorly recurring theme). I think this restaurant will be just fine, as soon as the head chef and manager are either motivated, retrained or replaced.",2021-01-17 03:24:04,746,3614,

It's fast. It's euphorically delicious. I'm pretty sure it's less expensive than going to a sit-down restaurant with the same quality of food. 

Let me tell you how bad my obsession is: I ALWAYS have an order ready, or I tweak it during the week before I finally treat myself. It's that good, with SO many options. 

Also, how are these guys killing it with every new restaurants they add?! The boba, the mexican food, the sushi, the bbq, the pastries and desserts... it's all phenomenal. I'm in love. 

The downsides are minor, but may limit certain types of eaters, especially with food allergies. You can't make any requests, no matter how small it is. For example, I can't order an item without cucumbers (where they're toppings and non-essential for the dish) for my boyfriend because he's allergic. 

Also, the app is rather glitchy. When you scroll, you'll accidentally click on a dish all the time. It also frequently asks me to log in even though I'm clearly logged in when I click on my profile.

The only dishes I've ever had issues with were the Basque Burrito (which was amazing the first time we tried it, but has been inconsistent in quality), and the Lox Bagel sandwich (very plain and bland). But if you try their Southern Fun, Boy-See-Boy NY Pizza, Queso Flameado, Jezebel Roll (note: extreme heat fans only, I can barely handle it and I've had restaurants challenge my heat tolerance before), Tokyo Hot Chicken meals or Iced Lavender Vert, I guarantee it's a good time.

My fiancé and I were greeted by Giovanni and was seated in a booth on the right hand side of the restaurant. We had time to look at the menu which is full of options for every taste. Sandwiches, soups, wraps, burgers, small bites. They have it all! 

I ordered a 16 oz chai tea and my fiancé ordered a mandarin key lime soda, to start off. Both were delicious and started off the experience on a high note. We then placed our order for dinner. Giovanni and our server (I don't remember him introducing himself) checked on us periodically and made sure we were liking our drinks and food once it was served. 

The vibe from the music playing, the artwork from local artists and the upbeat staff made for an overall very pleasant experience.

Our food was absolutely delicious. My fiancé likes spicy food and said it was the right amount of spice, the burger was made a perfect medium well and was juicy and seasoned well, too. I always order the gourmet grilled cheese and here is why. The creamy pesto aioli, the flavors of the cheddar, Havarti, provolone, and mozzarella melted together together makes for a silky smooth bite with the juicy tomato, the salty addition the bacon adds and the crunch from the truckee sour dough bread makes for the greatest sandwich ever. It's like fireworks in my mouth. Just so many amazing flavors at once. Dip it in the tomato soup and you have your childhood happiness that is sophisticated yet so simple. It brings me so much happiness and it is my absolute favorite menu item!

I was told that the shipping was delayed due to Covid-19 so my order would be received in 4-6 weeks.  In about a month I checked in and was told that it was 1/44 of an order that was shipping out on 10/29.  Obviously, that didn't happen.  Here I am on 1/12/21 still with no appliance.

I finally reached my limit today when I called again and was told it would be another 4-6 weeks. I have requested my order be cancelled and refunded.   We'll see how that goes.

Such is my story of the BRIO ITALIAN GRILLE in Cherry Hill an option chosen because their neighboring eatery had an hour and a half wait time.

Suspicions should have been raised upon discovering that there was no wait at all.  Once our experience was complete it was fully understood why people were willing to wait an hour and a half rather than stopping by at 'THE GRILLE.'

It is the time of COVID precautions so yes, the staff and policies all seemed to adhere to the rules for everyone's safety.  Perhaps that might have been worthy of a positive half star but nah ... I will leave this review at two stars.

The greeting was warm ... but upon requesting the wine list shock therapy was needed.  A glass of wine from $15???? FIFTEEN DOLLARS ... now I am not cheap with this is a shopping center-based restaurant that labels itself as a grille not an exquisite intimate 'restaurante' with all the implied charm that comes through the name ... this is a GRILLE  targeting shopping center customers at least that is how they market themselves.

Taking out the calculator wisdom shifted to purchasing a bottle of vino .... the choice with its Italian name from winery located in Italy's Abruzzo Region sounded like a possibility.  And, we certainly hoped it would be at FORTY FOUR DOLLARS a bottle.  Upon leaving THE GRILLE I discovered that my local winery was selling this Italian bottle for $14.95.  

My complaint was not with the smooth red liquid 'with legs' that was poured into the clean clear wine goblets but at the sense of being 'taken' even in this time when I tend to be generous towards restaurants that remain open.  Oh please give me a BYOB or a restaurant whose mark-up charges are only 40-50% over the retail market cost.

Did I mention that the server was fun and welcoming?  

No one was very hungry but flatbread pizza seemed to be a good choice.   Well, it was a good choice if you enjoy a large saltine cracker ... one in the group suggested it was matzoh ... with pink flavorless tomato slices randomly placed across the cracker ... oops the flatbread ... and some cheese and maybe garlic.  No melted cheese ... no gooeyness, no sauce, no taste except for the taste of a bland saltine cracker.  NEVER EVER EVER EVER order a flatbread at BRIO if you even consider going to this overpriced GRILLE at some time in your life (Remember that the hour and a half wait at the neighboring eatery is well worth it even though I don't like that chain's overly heavy food.).

Oh, I hope I didn't forget to tell you the server was outstanding!   He was willing to take the cracker back but we said no.  We did tell him to NEVER EVER recommend the BRIO Flatbread to anyone ever!  

We really didn't glance at the bill but he did take the CRACKER's cost off of our tab.  However, the only stars this place deserved were his and he received a very generous tip ... sort of an excessive amount matching the excessive charge for the bottle of wine!

Don't worry ... I'll never return but I am going to buy a few bottles of that wine (I just found it online for $9.95 a bottle; might do a case.  So THANK YOU GRILLE in the SHOPPING CENTER for introducing me to a new wine to enjoy.)!",2021-01-20 16:39:55,663,3314,

I went in with zero expectations and was delightfully surprised.   We ordered the Large fried fish platter with yams, and macaroni and cheese (platters come with two sides).  We decided to add a large side of cabbage as well. 

The first thing I tried was the macaroni and cheese: creamy and well seasoned.  It's not like a set baked macaroni that you might get from grandma on thanksgiving but I'm telling you variety is the spice of life and it is delicious. I set out to try a piece of the fish and my partner informed me we didn't have any ketchup (yes, ketchup on fish).  I tried a piece anyhow and quickly decided we would be defiling this fine meal by not having all of the appropriate accoutrements so we got up and went to the store to get a bottle of ketchup.  It was that serious.  So now, back at home with the warmed fish, our ketchup, macaroni, and yams, we were in heaven.  The fish was perfectly breaded and fried golden just like you want it.  The yams were tender with just the right amount of sweetness, cinnamon, et al. The cabbage was good as well, it made us feel better about downing all the carbs.

I would not recommend buying from Goedeker's if buying online. The fridge I bought was not described accurately so I called to inquire about returning it. They said someone would get back to me within a couple of days. 9 days later I finally called again and the person who answered said she couldn't help me but someone would get back to me through email. When they emailed me I told them I would like to return the fridge because the description was inaccurate (door was a rounded door and didn't match the flat door freezer right next to it). They told me I should have gone to a local store and looked at it before buying from them. What?? First of all, the fridge was back ordered so no one had it but why would someone suggest this? That's wrong. Go use another store then order from us?? Then they told me that I would have to pay to send it back and also pay for the original shipping cost which was another $240. So the fridge that cost me originally $776 I had to pay $480 to return. Obviously I didn't think this was reasonable. Someone called me back after I asked them to and said they would cover one of those charges and that I would have to pay 'just' $240. So I would still lose about 30%. That's unacceptable to me. The description should have been accurate. They said well it doesn't say the door is flat either. I didn't think to ask if the door was rounded. Who would?? Anyways, I wouldn't recommend this place, between an inaccurate description and then charging me 'just' $240, the resolution they suggested was a joke. Shop somewhere who stands behind their online product descriptions and takes care of their customers. She kept telling me that was all she could do and talking in circles.. but they have my money so there's not much I can do.

This has been the single worst experience I have ever had with a company of this type.  Their attention to detail is non-existent, customer service at a cable provider has better communication, and they bait and switch you into thinking they are a full service bridal shop. 

I was the best man in a wedding last weekend and 100% of the bridal party had issues.  Every single person in this wedding had some if not all of the issues listed below:  
- They could not get the name of the bride and groom correct. On multiple occasions.  From day one and throughout the entire process. Andy was getting married, not Tony. (There wasn't even a Tony in the wedding)
- Messages would be sent to the entire bridal party but addressed only one person.  Every person was Ryan, not 18 individual people.
- If a member of the bridal party was out of town, they assumed you were local and made as little effort as possible to accommodate alterations or returns for out of town people.  Example: If the suit they sent you did not match the sizing information you sent to them, they will charge you to send you a suit in the correct size.  Their mistakes cost you.
- Sizes were so off that it was almost as if they were just guessing rather than using the information we provided them.  I sent them my correct measurements 3 times.  They sent me two suits, one was so tight I couldn't even try it on, the other was so big it literally fell off me. The shoes were even the wrong size.   
-  They have no one in house to do alterations.  It is up to you to schedule any type of alternation with an independent seamstress.  I had to go to some women's private residence to piece meal together the two ill fitting suits they sent me the day before the wedding.  It cost me $140 out of my own pocket to fix the pants, vest, and suit jacket that were all completely the wrong size.  I finally hand a somewhat passible suit 30 minutes before the rehearsal dinner.  Mind you I had been asking for solutions to fix the suit fitting for weeks.  This was the best they had to offer.    
- Their communication is infuriating.  Everything is done through an autogenerated text messaging system.  They take days, sometimes over a week to respond to any request you make.  There is no urgency and they hide behind this text system.  It took me 3 days and countless text messages to get anyone on the phone.  
- They do not do what they say.  Our suits were purchased for us by the groom as a gift.  I got an autogenerate text message weeks before the wedding reminding me to return my tux/suit the day after the wedding.  I informed them this was incorrect and I was assured it was handled. Not so.  I got the same message the day of the wedding.  Reminded them again and I got another assurance it was handled.  Not so again!  I got the same message the day after the wedding!  Three times after being assured this mistake was handled.  I would not be shocked if I got a bill for a suit I already own.

At the end of the day, if you want to add extreme frustration, fear of knowing if your bridal party will have clothes to wear, and have everyone clothed in ill fitting suits and dresses, this is the company for you!

They are only doing drive-thru right now, and the drive-thru line is long. The line snakes out of the parking lot and down the street, at least two blocks into the nearby residential neighborhood. Think about the longest line that you've waited in for food. Now triple that. If we're talking about numbers, I waited 3 hours and 25 minutes, from start to finish, on a Wednesday. I got there right when they opened, at 10 a.m.

So you need to ask yourself: Are you prepared to wait three to four hours, in your car, for burgers and fries? Because if you're not, then you're not going to like your experience. But if you are willing to wait, then you will be rewarded with one of the best burgers in Indy.

Honestly, I visited California Burger and got in this absurdly long line for one big reason: I'm from Southern California, and the burgers that I saw on California Burger's Instagram looked like they might taste like the burgers at In-N-Out. They also had a lot of items on their menu that looked like what I would see at Yellow Basket, another one of my favorite greasy SoCal fast-food chain restaurants, such as pastrami sandwiches and pastrami chili fries. If there was a chance that I could taste something like In-N-Out or Yellow Basket in Indianapolis, then I had to get in line. 

The verdict is: California Burger definitely has the best fast-food burger that I've tasted in Indiana. I ordered the Avocado Burger, and the bun was lightly toasted (it was soft, but just toasted and slightly crunchy around the edges), the beef was perfectly cooked and juicy, the cheese was melted completely, the lettuce, red onion, avocado and tomato was fresh and just enough, and the best part for me is that it wasn't super tall! I was able to actually take a bite of it and eat it in my car. It came wrapped in a burger diaper, like In-N-Out does their burgers, so you can definitely eat the burger while you're driving. I could sense a whisper of In-N-Out and Yellow Basket in my Avocado Burger. It was definitely the closest that I've had to anything tasting like something from one of those places since I've been in Indy.

I got my husband the California Melt, which is apparently one of their most popular burgers. He loved it, too. 

I also got a large order of fries and onion rings, and the onion rings came with a side of ranch dressing. The fries were perfect: crinkle cut fries that are crispy when you bite into them, but nicely mealy as you chew. If I had to offer a suggestion, the onion rings could have been a little greasier. They tasted really good, though! I would get them again.

If I could offer another suggestion, I feel like California Burger needs to pare down their menu quite a bit. I think this would help with the wait, too, because people wouldn't have so many options, and the kitchen could focus on churning out a thoughtfully curated menu. On the menu, there is everything from burgers to burritos to taquitos to fried shrimp to mozzarella sticks. Then there's an ice cream menu that includes shakes, Blizzard-type treats, sundaes, banana splits, different types of ice creams ... I could go on. Just look at my photo of the menu. Sometimes a lot of options are great, but in this case, because they cook everything to order, I think that their broad menu is contributing to their slow service. 

They just opened at the beginning of January 2021, so I'm hoping things like the slow service and extremely long wait gets worked out, because I really love California Burger's food and I want to go back! I'll just have to wait until the crowd dies down so that it doesn't take me half a work day to get my food.",2021-01-27 23:35:43,779,3713,

My best friend turned 30 and she specifically chose this place because she had heard that their cold water lobster tail is phenomenal and can be added to any entree for an additional charge. Unfortunately, we learned  that they did not receive a large enough shipment and would be unable to serve any lobster. That was disappointing. Nonetheless she chose an alternate option and we placed our orders. 

There were a total of 6 of us at dinner. Two of the members of our dinner party were vegetarian so they were limited on their options but they both have been there several times and spoke highly of the almond butter rice noodles. Unfortunately, they were let down this time around. The flavors that they were boasting about were absent last night. They both stated that the dish usually has a brownish tint to it due to the sauce but there was no sauce and seemingly no seasoning. They both asked for a extra side of sauce. One of the two said it improved the dish but was overall left disappointed. The other was still completely dissatisfied and ultimately sent the dish back. 

As far as customer service, it was just okay which was another slight let down. Our waitress was very nice but her visits to the table were honestly so far apart that on several occasions we had to ask other waiters passing by to grab her for us. 

On a brighter note, our party was very pleased with the Truffle Mac and cheese, Shrimp cargot, Shrimp cocktail, Chowder, Salmon, and Shrimp bulgogi. So, if you are thinking about visiting then these may be a few solid options.

My girlfriend and her family live near where they can order takeout if not choosing to dining in.  Even when we moved to Virginia, we would stop by during each Christmas visit and eat there and most of the time the food was top notch from service to quality.  This visit however posed a big difference.

As like many restaurants across the country, they're doing strictly takeout due to the pandemic.  Upon entering inside the building, they have signs requiring face masks and hand sanitizer stations.  Also, the entrance to the dining area is blocked by chairs.  So, we would have to go on the right side of the bar to pick up your order.  There were a bunch of orders showing that the community was still supporting the business.  One sign on the door says 5 people can enter at a time.  When we got there, it was slightly more than 5 people, even though they were wearing masks.  And it looked like there was some confusion with one of the orders that was placed by another party where they requested for a refund (another story).  

Once we picked up our orders, we headed back to my girlfriend's childhood home.  Now remember when I said the food was top notch?  Well, not this time.  I ordered a boneless chicken combination lunch plate (all-white meat) with fried rice, veggies and an egg roll.  Unfortunately, the chicken didn't have much flavor.  The fried rice was light in texture and color, was bland and the shrimp looked like it was processed rather than shrimp you would see straight off the Gulf of Mexico.  The egg roll itself was more like a kitchen sink with veggies, meat and gravy mixed inside, which was odd.  On every visit, my meal would be so big that I would save the rest for later on in the night or the next day.  But I ended up throwing it all away :(

As for China Doll, I'm sure they are struggling mightily during the pandemic.  The reason for the quality of the food is maybe the result of vendors not being able to supply the usual fare which might have them 'cutting corners' just to get food out to their usual customers.  Again, just speculation, not fact.  I just hope that once this pandemic clears up, they'll be able to function on a normal basis.

I work as a designer/GC coordinator and had a client who had purchased all of her plumbing fixtures for a large bathroom at Henry, which the plumber had recommended. A couple weeks after obtaining the fixtures, she decided to go with a different color scheme. We went through her receipts to find the return policy and there was nothing that was clear in the paperwork, so I had her call Henry.  When she asked if there would be any issue returning the items, the sales associate said a cheerful, ""No! Not at all."" (I know this because I was present when the call was made on speaker phone). This was not the case. She was able to return the items that Henry had in stock for a full refund but anything that they had ordered through the supplier was subject to a 60 percent restocking fee, which applied to over $2000 worth of items. It would be one thing if the employee had told her that over the phone, and though it still would have been outrageous in my opinion, at least we would have known before purchasing the new fixtures. My client spoke to various Henry employees over the next week explaining the miscommunication but Henry never made it right. I have spoken with the plumber that we used and told him that any future job he does with us would not use Henry and suggested he not use them for other jobs as well. 

Overall, I recommend going to Henry to see fixtures in person but never to buy from them. The same exact items are available at Amazon and Wayfair and their customer service is exponentially better, with no restocking fees and often free return shipping. Also, Kohler, Moen, Delta, etc will still honor any lifetime warranties if you purchase from Amazon or Wayfair. There's really no reason to purchase from Henry.

I'm talking spotless bathrooms and counters toilets floors yes the beds are new clean sheets big tvs clean new carpet spotless windows pure hospitality folded towels that look like swans. WHEW! I'm sorry let me breathe. -blinks- this is NO dream. Whispers it's so real. 
I promise I went to sleep then woke up. It's all still here. Just a new shift of kind people wanting to know if I ate. Come on downstairs to get breakfast. Smiling employees who are kind and a joy to be around. I'm afraid to blink.
 This is heaven on earth. The pool is spotless the workout room spotless. No employees are texting or sleeping this is simply amazing. They seem to enjoy their jobs they seem to treat this place like their own home. The housekeepers are cleaning and are giving out new stuff. Omg soap and the good kind. I've been giggling like a mad scientist for the past two days. I'm addicted to this place. This is amazing. Omg five stars. Look I will issue them a billion stars. Did I tell you the housekeeper changed my sheets. She gave me extra clean towels. My eyes have tears. This is the best place to stay in Saint Louis! This place is everything. Next time my grandmother visits me. I'm gonna have her stay one night here only so they can spoil her and treat her like a goddess. I simply love this place!",2021-01-19 06:05:32,380,1782,

This is not an extermination service in the classical sense of the word when it comes to bed bugs. Granted, everyone knows how difficult these little vampires are to eradicate completely, but that's supposed to be what the professionals are for. Delmar is actually the kind of company you SHOULDN'T call for this particular problem because they are a ""Treat and Maintenance"" company. 

So they will treat your house ($1,000) with these completely insufficient and outdated techniques, such as pesticides that the bugs are immune to, and foggers (NO ONE uses foggers anymore as they have been proven to just drive the bugs further into the wall, killing hardly any of them) and then urge you to get quarterly maintenance ($100.00) ""in case"" the bugs return (and this is how you string along a drug addict). Then there's the guarantee --- for 90 days they will cover the return of bugs for free. Anyone who has researched bed bugs will be able to say it with me: the bugs can hibernate for up to 12 months without feeding!!! For nearly five months after the treatment, I thought things were fairly quiet, though I know now that I was actually getting very small single bites (everyone's reaction is different). The bites got larger and more serious looking and it was evident that the problem wasn't solved, but the manager at Delmar wanted to argue with me on the phone that after that many months, I couldn't possibly still have bugs. Welp, 12 months, dude...12 months they could be there without showing their insidious marks. 

To top it off, my infestation started in the living room furniture, and they didn't even bother to try to sell me on couch covers that I found out later they actually did have the entire time, and would have gladly paid for at that point. We could have contained the bugs in that one area as they were caught very quickly in the beginning. Now they have spread all over the house. 

I've had to go with another company and the saga continues. So if you experience the depressing and painful existence of bed bugs in your house, please go with a national company, such as Ehrlich, Orkin, Terminix, etc. Anyone but these local buffoons!!!!",2021-01-08 21:46:12,457,2221,

So I called on Wednesday to get estimates on a replacement garage opener and to check if the $329 special was still valid and if there was any other fees. Lady on the phone said it was valid and the $329 installed covered all fees. And she'd send someone out for estimates the next day (Thursday). Out of caution I usually ask if there is a fee for estimates, and was told ""no"".

Person who came on Thursday was very friendly but right away told me there's a $20 visit fee to do the estimate. Not only does that mean estimates are not free, but also it means i was misled into thinking there was no fee. Technician said he had to call head office to get it waived and he did. But it left a bad feeling.

Same with the $329 installed. I was told during visit (Thursday) it is going to be 329 + 20 visit fee. That made it $349 installed, even though the coupon said $329 installed (plus when I had called on Wednesday, lady on the phone had confirmed the $329 included all fees). Also, while technician is on the call with his manager / head office (?) - the person asks to speak to me and tries to put pressure on me to make a purchase right away. This is after I made it clear to the technician that this was a large expense for me and I needed time to think about it.

Manager(?) / person on phone also tried to convince me that I had made a mistake since the Tech didn't need to come out to just do an estimate. I was surprised by that as I had called for an estimate -- and I know what I called for. Further, most of the other places I called for estimates also wanted to send someone over before they gave me an estimate.

The good news is they did waive the visit fee.

However, many things about this service call and the way they seem to do business did not seem right to me and I want to caution others to be careful when you deal with this business and make sure everything including ""free estimates"" is in writing.

One good part about this visit is that the technician was polite and wore a mask.",2021-01-08 01:02:42,479,2173,

This review is for the service and interactions with the staff on-site on Sunday, 1/3/21. We're regulars of the downtown location, and will continue to go to that store.

In short, what could be improved at the Goleta location is communication, honesty, and professional demeanor/attitude.

We ordered in advance pick-up via DoorDash (DD). The estimated time of pickup was 20-30 minutes from order time, which was 12:30 p.m. We received notification the order was ready prior to our arrival time, via the DoorDash app. That means, the restaurant processed, through DD, that the order was ready. We arrived maybe 10 minutes after that time. 

The staff person at the front indicated our order was not ready and I replied that they (restaurant) had confirmed it was, ready, via the app. She said ""yeah, but all of our orders are 30-40 minutes to be ready"". I thought that was dishonest, (why confirm it's ready if it's not?) but decided to wait because things happen.  The staffer indicated 15 more minutes until ready. After 20 minutes, (so 45 minutes from when I placed our order for two cold sandwiches) I checked in again at the front. The same staff person asked for my name and another stood by her as I indicated it had been 45 minutes from time of order. The staffer indicated our order was coming up ""soon"" and it was ""in the oven"". Very odd since we ordered cold sandwiches - I said this ""our sandwiches are cold, they're being heated up?"" and received two blank stares. 

At no point, did anyone on the staff say anything friendly or remotely apologetic. I saw orders that looked suspiciously like they were placed after ours be picked up as I waited.

I contacted DD while still at the store to make sure they could help me and they did. I left after about an hour from original order placing time, after trying to be patient and hoping for the best in people. I have had a super varied work history, so could sympathize with being slammed, but not with poor, dishonest service.",2021-01-04 23:56:22,438,2111,

Several of these families didn't even make a reservation and asked the hostess if they needed to, and the hostesses said no. Then another hostess/worker in a red uniform was also rude and shouting the entire time while trying to figure out where to seat people. When my wife and I sat down it got a little better for a bit, but then it started getting PACKED. I mean this place had a FULL HOUSE of guests and WAS NOT enforcing the 50% capacity mandate. No tables were spaced out at all and they sat people at every single table. I couldn't believe the amount of people in this place! They were even letting massive parties of people sit all together, and tried to separate some, but definitely just had them sitting right on top of each other. By the end of the night even the servers started getting rude. On my way out I looked and almost every table was completely full! Even the entryway of the establishment was full of multiple families congregating and breathing all over each other.

Here's how the experience went:

1) I call to order and was told by the host, ""sorry, we're really backed up in the kitchen - it's going to be at least two hours h til we can take your order.... (pause- it's already 7:00 so that's not an option) so, I say thanks but no thanks

2) My son is adamant that we try it, so we're willing to wait - I call back within 5 minutes of my first call. THIS time I'm told, ""sure, we can take your order!  It will be ready within an hour"" (WTF?!). I place the order - like an idiot. 

3) We go to pick up the pizza (no delivery) on time and as the hostess is checking to see which order we're there for, she says, ""Got it!  It's all ready - let me go grab it...."" followed by, ""oh, you got the fried cheese"". I signed the receipt, tipped VERY WELL and, not knowing what she meant by the cheese comment, she goes back inside. 

4) waiting in the car for 15 minutes while she ""grabs our food""....

5) she finally comes out and hands me a COLD pizza, COLD wings, room temperature Wedge salad, and hot cheese. NOW I know why she made the aforementioned ""cheese"" comment. I ask her if our food was under the salamander that whole time and she said, no, it was on the counter.... ON THE COUNTER!!!! Now, she asks if we want her to put it all back in the oven to warm it up - which was ludicrous. I said, ""no, I'll take it home and do it, we're starving"". She smiles, says ""okay"" and walks back inside.... 

We get home and after reheating ALL the food and chilling the salad, the food was freaking amazing. That's the only reason for the two stars. 

Now, tonight, I figure I'd give them a second try... this is how our second attempt went:

Me: I'd like to place an order for pickup
Her: Yeah, so, I'd totally, normally say yes, but our kitchen is way backed up. Can you try calling in.... (click - I hung up). Not even going to go through that again. 

I'm so wildly disappointed in this restaurant. Their potential was right there to be amazing, but absolutely oblivious and terrible service doesn't outweigh the good food. Maybe when they get their act together we'll try on our next trip, but until then.... we'll spend our money elsewhere.

IUa0YkQ9Rys7JoHJIhiTAA,A9cXP_K95FRor1qxuUEu2g,azrVoXsO-fMRxuOmoYUvog,5,11,1,8,"The Living Room Theatre opens up a spot in downtown Indy's Bottleworks District and maintains much of the historic, classic vibe that we've always loved about Mass Avenue. 

The Living Room Theatre did a sort of soft opening over the holidays with a more traditional opening this past week. It's still running relatively light due to health guidelines in place due to the pandemic. However, this is an ideal opportunity for Living Room to work out the kinks and be prepared to handle the crowds that will most certainly arrive. 

As much as I hate to say anything negative about Landmark, the truth is that this is likely what we all pictured when Landmark arrived in town. While I most certainly still love Landmark and truly can't wait for Kan-Kan to get going, this is a beautiful establishment that should become one of downtown Indy's destination spots. They screen a weaving together of truly indie films, critically acclaimed films, and some Hollywood wide releases. They offer dining/drink options and really give off an aura of classic Hollywood. 

Even the outside of the theatre just left me smiling like a schoolboy, I miss the classic look of theatres. It was just awesome to see. 

Living Room Theatres is a very small ""chain"" of sorts that was started by filmmakers to enhance the moviegoing experience. The first one opened in Portland, the second at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, and now Indy is the third (and largest) location. 

All screens are digitally projected in 2K and 4K resolution with 5.1 and 7.1 surround sound.

The food menu offers everything from the traditional movie snacks to vegan/vegetarian options to sandwiches, pizzas, and small plates. There's a beer menu that seems to emphasize local breweries (Yay!). They do have a full bar! 

Checking out a movie is a little bit unnerving these days, but Living Room is being socially responsible and really doing well. The eight auditoriums are incredibly nice with comfy seats and accessibility is quite strong. The mural work is a nice combo of classic Hollywood and Indy. The giant King Kong mural is a must see. Amazing work. 

There's an amazing staircase, though obviously you should probably avoid going on it if you're in a wheelchair. :) 

The individual theatre designs are beautiful - as is typically true, not every spot in a theatre is accessible, but there are accessible spots in each theatre and lobby elevators to get you to the 2nd floor! The 8 screens total 27,000 square feet of space and auditoriums have recliners and select rows with rocker seats. 

I'll admit that I'm a pretty simple moviegoer. I don't tend to eat a lot and on this occasion really just wanted to catch a documentary on the big screen, but it's hard not to fall in love with this new indie theatre in town. You should make plans to check out Living Room for yourself!",2021-01-17 18:01:11,552,2854,

Service was slow, we waited the longest to have our drink order taken. We noticed the heat lamps beside us and asked if it was possible to get them turned on also. Upon finishing our first round of drinks we tried to flag the server to order some more and ask for the lamps to be turned on for the second time. Our server looked our way many times and still took at least 10mins to come over and get our order, we again asked about the lamp because it was starting to get very cold, he again told us he would have it lit. Again another 15mins pass and we notice someone going around lighting all the heaters... and the one beside us was the last one lit in the whole place after us asking for at least 30mins! 

When we finally get the check and close when our second round is delivered because the waiting for everything else was awful.We then come to notice the server hovering over the table waiting on the tip to be signed. We didn't sign it straight away as we both had two full drinks in front of us, he even at one point lifted it and we had to tell him we hadn't signed it yet.

So we give him an 18% tip because I never like to stiff a server even if it was horrendous service and when we get home while checking my bank account I noticed that the server added himself an additional $10 on top of the tip already left for himself.

Good view but not worth the awful service and employees messing with the cheque amount totals.

When they arrived, one of the movers wasn't wearing a mask, and when I asked if he had one, he said no. Eventually he found one somewhere, but he and one of the other movers didn't wear masks for most of the time. Only one of the movers wore a mask the whole time. This company shouldn't advertised covid protocols/safety if they're not going to follow them. 

They also arrived without a mattress protector, like they told me they would have. Instead, they wasted 10 minutes shrink wrapping my mattress. While moving items, they were pretty careless- dropping items, tossing them to each other, etc. They damaged one of our desks, and one of my items is missing. 

They took a long time driving from the storage unit to my house. I was driving ahead of them, so I know how long it should take to get there. They told me they subtracted some time off their total but I don't believe this was true. 

The company was extremely misleading about the charges ahead of time, and I ended up spending hundreds of dollars more than I expected. They even charged $38.50 for ""materials""..when I asked them to explain, they said it was for tape. They only taped a couple things, and I also know tape doesn't cost that much. I would have bought my own tape.

The drive back home knocked over my sushi so please excuse the pictures . I've been coming here for years whenever I'm in Brandon or Valrico! It's only recently when decided to try their food and I was happily surprised at how good the food is here. 

Coming from Montreal, Sushi quality in the United States, in general, is not that great. Good sushi is hard to come by and I still find that to be true.

However, I didn't expect one of the better sushi spots in Tampa to come from a Boba Drink and Frozen Yogurt Specialty shop! 

Papaya Milk Tea, 1/4 sweet with protein- I've had it at regular sweetness and it's super sweet. They use a sugar flavoured powder for the papaya taste. They also add a shot of condensed milk as well as more sugar. I've tried it without the condensed milk and no extra sugar and it became too watery and not sweet at all. Then I just did condensed milk and no liquid sugar and that was a great balance. Adding 1/4 sweetness to it really brings it up to a sweet treat in my opinion. Adding the protein powder gives it depth and an extra layer of creaminess and makes it a bit more filling! This is my favourite sweet drink to get. 5/5

Chicken Teriyaki bowl- feeling hungry? This is a decently priced filling delicious hot bowl! The chicken is lightly crisp with a delicious teriyaki sauce. The vegetables(carrots and broccoli), being plain, make this healthier than one drenched in sauce. 4/5

Spicy Tuna Sushi Roll- not spicy at all but delicious! Very light seasoning on top to attempt to make it spicy.  4/5

Dragon Sushi Roll- this was my cousin and partners favourite sushi. There's avocado and baked eel in eel sauce (a sweet delicious sauce).  The inside is imitation crab and cucumber. 5/5

Lobster Sushi- this was my favourite sushi. The baked crawfish on top mixed in an eel sauce and spicy Mayo sauce is delicious. This is served on top of the California based sushi roll (imitation crab, avocado and cucumber). It's expensive for a non sushi specialty place but I think it's a filling dish that's more flavourful than a Big Mac meal which is a few more dollars expensive. 5/5",2021-01-10 16:16:40,464,2260,

Of those in the Treasure Valley, I would recommendation is Sofia's Greek Bistro in Garden City. Owner Litsa M. grew up working in her parents Greek restaurant in Pocatello, Tom Gyro & Burgers. Sofia's is named after her mother. 

The photos pictured are from my visit on 8/12/20. My take-out order was: Dolmada ($2.20), Greek Salad ($10.99), Combo Plate ($15.99) with rice pilaf substituted for fries ($.95) and extra Taziki ($1.45).

Dolmades are beef and rice stuffed grape leaves. Sofia tops hers with Avgolemono (lemon) sauce. Dolmades are not my favorite Greek dish, but it had been a while since I had one, and I had never tried one from Sofia's, so I ordered one. Given how big these are, this item is the best value,on the menu. While the quality was good, the filling was under seasoned. Most of the flavor came from the combination of the grape leaf and the lemon sauce. 

Sofia's Greek Salads are the best I have had locally, but I was disappointed to find mine came with very little salad dressing. To make matters worse, when I called the restaurant to share what had happened, the woman who  took my order told me that she thought it was too little salad dressing and had commented on this to the cook, to no avail. I was asked what I needed to make things better. I asked for a credit for half a salad since that's how much salad dressing I had. I was told there would be a credit for half a salad under my name for the next time I visited. I haven't had an opportunity to revisit yet. Incidents like this is why it is so important to check your food order personally before you leave the restaurant, when doing takeout.

The Combo Plate is Greek marinated chicken and sliced Gyro meat on top of fries. It is served with feta cheese, Taziki, Kalamata olives and warm pita bread. There is a $.95 charge for substituting rice pilaf for fries. One of my pet peeves about this dish is having to pay $.95 more for rice pilaf instead of french fries, when rice pilaf is more traditional. I've only done take out from Sofia's one other time, but I wasn't charged extra for Taziki sauce, nor have I ever been charged extra for this item while dining at the restaurant, where I was given a generous enough portion that I didn't have to ask for extra. The order comes with 2 ounces of Taziki sauce, which is clearly not enough for both the chicken and gyro meat. I don't normally comment on prices, but I think $16.99 is a bit steep when you consider the gyro meat is not made in house. It is highly processed meat that is pre-cooked and reheated on site.

I like that Sofia's takes the time to properly heat up their pita bread, don't charge you extra for feta cheese and give you a decent amount of Kalamata olives.

Other dishes I recommend are: Hippie Dippie, Spanakopita, Greek Hummus, Greek Sampler, Gyro, the Gyro Bowl and Moussaka. I did not care for the Saturday Night Lamb and Patatas Special. 

I enjoy the physical environment which has blue walls reminiscent of the Mediterranean and primitive artwork displayed on the walls, which is the handiwork of the owner. During the summer, the concrete floors and blue walls make it a nice reprieve from the heat outside, and reminiscent of a trip to the Mediterranean. However, due to the concrete floors in large glass windows, it can get a bit chilly in the winter time, so dress accordingly. 

My recommendation for those visiting this restaurant is that you take the time to ask if Litsa M. will be present and cooking herself the day/time you plan to visit. This was my first experience visiting when she was not there. I would rate this visit 3 stars, but all my prior visits were a solid 4 stars, with the exception of the one time I visited on what turned out to be Trivia night. With all of the hard surfaces, the volume was obnoxiously loud. That was the first time I chose to do takeout.

Sofia's is located in a strip mall near the corner of State Street and Glenwood.  The address is 6748 N. Glenwood. Business hours are Monday through Saturday from 11 AM to 9 PM.",2021-01-12 03:19:28,864,4099,

It was edible, but that's about all it was.  

First of all, having a calzone with cheese sauce and real cheese is redundant and unnecessary.  In theory it sounded good, in practice it just makes a big mess.  

And the pickles....wow.  The slices were huge, they had to be at least twice as thick as normal pickles.  1 or 2 at the most of these in different areas of the calzone are plenty.  I counted at least 4.  Newsflash guys, pickles are supposed to be a topping, not the main event.  If I wanted a pickle calzone I would've ordered one.  Cut back on the pickles, in fact it wouldn't be a bad thing if you cut them out altogether, that's a weird item to put in a calzone.  

At least the dough was really good, and obviously of homemade quality.  That's what kept this thing from being 1 star.  

The hamburger and bacon were adequate, but nothing special, and it seemed way too much like these featured items were competing for attention with the pickles.  If you're going to put bacon bits and hamburger in a calzone, then put it there and stop stacking it with pickles.  

Did I mention there were way too many pickles in this thing?

And the menu is like pizza out of bizarro world.  Why would I want pineapple jam on a pizza?  That belongs on a sandwich, not a pizza.  Regular pineapple is fine, pineapple jam is a sweet flavor and sweet doesn't belong on a pizza.    

Way too much pandering to the vegan and vegetarian crowd.

We stopped in for a late dinner after beers at the Vortex Video Game Bar. It's located in a strip off Central Ave in Pasadena -- parking is limited and it's not a big place, so plan ahead if you want to check it out. 
We rolled in after 9pm on a Saturday and found the inside bar and dining space about 3/4 full. Staff was all masked and taking particular care to wipe down tables as guests left - when we got there, a few parties had just left the booths along the wall, so we saw those tables get wiped down before we were offered any of them to sit at.
Guests have the option of of paper or digital menus once seated. The paper list of craft beer options on draft comes on a clipboard and is a few pages long, so plenty of options of you're a beer snob the way we are!
In terms of food, safe to say the kitchen at Wheelhouse has a lot of fun with their offerings in terms of creativity and naming. For example, I highly recommend you try their ""Hot Totties"" -- tater tots covered with cheddar, bacon, sour cream, and the best part: jalapeño pepper relish! Perfectly fried, beautifully presented, and the right amount of heat to be flavorful without being painful. Delicious for the tater tots fans out there!
Since it was late and we'd had some beer, we weren't famished by any means, we decided for a main course to try what they call ""Bird is the Word"" - 3 flour tortilla soft tacos filled with marinated chicken, shredded cabbage, onion, cilantro, queso fresco, and a cilantro cream sauce. 
Believe me when I tell you the portions are generous here - Mel couldn't even finish one of the tacos, and while I finished the rest of the order, I probably shouldn't have! If you're minding your waistline, make sure you're splitting this with someone!
We skipped on dessert this time, but we're certain to go back thanks to the excellent food, impressive beer selection, and very friendly staff. Suggest you give it a try as well!",2021-01-31 21:59:31,443,2074,

Sofia is absolutely a place you go to 'see and be seen' -- for a second, I forgot I was dining on Julia St. and felt transported to the swankiest spot on the Las Vegas Strip! It's got high end written all over it with a moderate price tag! 

I made a Saturday night reservation for 5pm because we wanted somewhere nice to watch the football games and eat something other than your standard bar food, ya know, fried everything?! In the additional comments box, I asked to be seated with a view to their TV as another reviewer had mentioned this was an option. When the hostess called to confirm our reservation, I was so delighted to hear her say that had us at a high top table with a direct view to the tv; to be honest, I didn't even know people read those requests!

I started with a glass of the Cabernet and my +1 got a Peroni. I had already scoured the menu thanks to good ol' Yelp but I gave my sweetie a chance to look over it nonetheless. We started with the very popular house ricotta, meatballs and an order of garlic bread (I don't think this was explicitly listed on the menu). The two meatballs were delicious and a perfect starter. The side order of garlic bread was decadent and the perfect pairing to the meatball sauce. Now, if you're like me and unable to control yourself around carbs, you may want to hold off on ordering the side order of bread simply because it is so rich! I forgot the ricotta also came with bread, focaccia, to be exact, so my jeans were already feeling tight by the middle of appetizers! I thought the ricotta was good as served but it made for an excellent dip for that leftover pizza crust.. yall know what I'm talking about, don't make me explain!

Of course, we couldn't stop at just apps though. I had my heart set on the Cacio e Pepe and The Spicy since the moment I made the reservation but ultimately decided on just getting the pizza since we were pretty full at this point. It was great and definitely had a kick to it -- I'm Indian, so take my word when I say something is spicy! Naturally there were leftovers which the excellent servers were willing to box for us (in super nice re-usable containers at that for my fellow tupperware hoarders!) Can I just say how much I love when the restaurant boxes stuff for you? I really feel like it elevates the dining experience!  

We will definitely be returning because I have to get my hands on that Cacio e Pepe. Our server, Gabe, was absolutely wonderful and I liked seeing their GM Peter roll up his sleeves and helping out his staff while also checking in with patrons at their table. I also love the two larger tables they have with lazy Susans in the middle to make all the food sharing so easy!

I finally went to get it today and it totally lived up to the expectation. They are open and you can order for a pick-up or delivery through uberEat, Postmates, DoorDash. I called in for a pick-up and the food was ready in 25 minutes! 

I ordered the yam porridge with fried chicken wings, Egusi soup with Mackerel fish, and beef Suya. In terms of portions, there was plenty of food for an entrée, especially the yam porridge. My partner absolutely loved it. He ordered plantains on the side. The chicken was still crispy and warm by the time I arrived home and so was everything else.

The famous Egusi with Fufu is all over tiktok so I decided to try it for myself. I definitely was not disappointed by it. I didn't have any expectation because I never had Nigerian food before but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The Fufu was so smooth, soft and a little chewy, pairing perfectly with the soup. The texture reminds me of mochi but softer and not sticky. 

The last dish that I ordered was the beef suya. The texture was more chewy and hard like jerky but the seasoning was interesting and different from anything I had before. I was not crazy about it but it was worth the try. 

Overall, I'm really happy with this experience at the Ofure Palace. The food definitely lived up to its reputation. The price was so reasonable and cheap for the portions that you were getting. The quality was good. I am neither an African nor someone who is familiar with African cuisine so I cannot tell you how authentic the food is.

They have walk-in appointments and are open until either 6pm, or 7pm, depending on the day. Due to my ever changing work schedule and often being caught late at work, these make getting an adjustment a lot easier. It is also more affordable than other chiropractors I have been to in town.  With how my insurance works, I would have to pay $30 to $40 per visit to other chiropractors.  Doing the 4 visits per month plan I now pay, rounding up, $18 a visit... you can see why this makes a huge difference to me.  They also don't take insurance so this is a normally rate.  Also once you signed up with one office, you can go to any of The Joints. So when I have a bad back after a long drive to California, I can walk into a Joint there and get an adjustment.  It is really nice.
In terms of the service you receive, you have to remember that they have numerous different chiropractors working there, and they all have their own specific style for completing adjustments.  You might have to try a few doctors before you find one you really like and if you go in at different times, like I normally have to, you get to meet them.  I have been able to find 3 doctors there I really like. When you find one you like, they try to let you know where they are going to be and when they will be there, but seeing if there is more than one doctor you like is more helpful to you.
The Joint has helped me keep some of my medical issues from creating more issues which I thank them for a million times over. I will always recommend this place when it comes to one's chiropractic needs.",2021-01-16 06:48:20,356,1655,

Kendrick was excellent to work with from start to finish. In a tough year with little personal interaction, he established a friendly rapport from the get-go by setting up an introductory meeting and keeping phone and text contact a constant throughout the process. I was hugely impressed by his response times, there somehow wasn't a single instance when he was unavailable. It was easy for me, a first time home buyer, to find common ground with Kendrick, and his patient and friendly demeanor was a huge help to keeping stress to a manageable level.

Kendrick is very knowledgeable about the market and the different neighborhoods of Santa Barbara, down to the property level, where he usually had some details ready to go on any given listing that appeared.

Kendrick was also a great resource in selecting local mortgage and insurance brokers, should you be looking for advice there, as well.

Once we found a property I wanted to pursue, he exhibited phenomenal negotiation skills. We were able to work together to customize offer packages that were creative and well tailored to the listing. He was able to successfully navigate me through an offer, and a couple counter-offers to secure entry into escrow. I am confident that both myself and the sellers are very happy with the end result.

While in escrow, Kendrick kept himself up to date, checking in with me at critical times to see if I had any questions and usually to put my mind at ease. He coordinated flawlessly behind the scenes with the listing agent to set up inspections (he booked some of these for me himself, a huge help), walkthroughs, and requests for seller credits.

The professionalism and helpful manner hasn't stopped there, Kendrick has continued to follow up with me after closing, helping to coordinate between myself and the previous owners, offering up good advice at every juncture.

Thank you Kendrick!",2021-01-02 20:31:43,370,1991,

Very unsure of why there are so many dazzling reviews. I was really excited to try it out as it has 5 star reviews but my experience was average and somewhat strange. First, the place is completely empty - there's no people! And I was there on a Friday night at 7pm when you would assume it would be packed. So there was no atmosphere and very quiet music. I think they opened just before the pandemic so that may be why. It seems to come off as a very nice retaurant as the waitresses are wearing vests and slacks...but then dont even have table clothes so it's trying to be a very nice restaurant but isn't? As soon as we got to our table, our waitress immediately asked us what we wanted to drink without even seeing a drink menu which I found very odd/rushed. She came back 1 minute later and we still did not have enough time. Then at the same time we got our drinks, she asked for our food order without having a minute to look at it. The timing of the whole service experience felt very off to me and like they don't know what they're doing really. The drinks came and had zero garnish on them and tasted like sugar water without any alcohol in them. I paid $9 for a mojito that tasted like lime juice and no garnish. We got a calimari appetizer and it was pretty chewy with some pieces ard to get down. I ordered the burger and it was simply okay..they forgot the sauce on it and my friends burger said it came with a spinach bun and just got a regular bun. The fries were a mix of burnt pieces and soggy ones. My friend got the shrimp and grits and I took a bite and one of the shrimp wasn't fully shelled which was disgusting as I had to spit it out on my plate, not worth $20. I could make this at home for cheaper. I don't know...I'm not quite understanding the hype or the vibe of this place at all. It's a bunch of different cuisine items on one menu like Mexican, Italian, Greek, American... and all of them are just so so. I think they would do really well with focusing mastering one type of cuisine and condensing to menu to a few great items that are perfected. I've read the chef is a nice guy so I'm sure he's trying his best but as of now, I wouldn't choose to go back here.",2021-01-30 19:40:37,492,2249,

We had a part of 10 yesterday (1/17), and the owner/manager was the one who set our tables up. He was polite and did what he could to accommodate for all 10 of us to eat together, which was nice of him. Originally, he stated that we couldn't have more than 3 people per table, but he set up 4 tables (3+2+3+2), which was weird because we technically only needed 4 tables if his statement was true to begin with. 5 of us got there 1st, and we were all seated (3+2). My sister & her family (remaining party of 5) get there, and asks the manager/owner if they can seat 4 at one table, both parents, their 2 year old daughter, their 6 year old son who cannot eat by theirselves, and have their oldest son sit with our table that only had only 2 people (he was sitting at a table by himself)? The manager says no, & tells them that we can't have more than 4 people at one table. My in-law then asks, how come he can't sit with the table with 2 people since that won't be more than 3 people? The manager gets irritated and with his loud tone of voice yells, ""you can't seat more than 3 people per table, this is Reno's covid law. Please don't give me a hard time!"". After he bursted out like that, the entire back section (at least 6-10 tables of 3 or more customers just stopped eating & stared at my sister's family for about 10 seconds in silence. I'm not sure if he was having a bad day, maybe he lost $ betting/gambling, or he just wasn't in the mood to deal with anybody, but it was extremely unprofessional of him. He could've easily said, ""Sorry, this is the best that I can do to keep you all together"" in a professional tone of voice, but he did the exact opposite. I've only been to this place twice, with this being my 2nd time & I would've never thought shit like this would ever happen since the staff are so friendly & helpful. My sister's entire family were humiliated & then they eventually left without eating anything. We were at Soda Springs for our snow play & I recommended this restaurant to them (which we back tracked 41 miles back into Nevada for) and we could not believe that this is the shit that we had to deal with. If the manager/owner wasn't sure what the state/county/city guidelines were, wasn't sure how to explain it, or wasn't sure how to set a table up where it wouldn't violate covid guidelines, he should've just done what all other business owners do, PRINT THE GOD DAMN COVID GUIDELINES OUT & POST THEM ON YOUR WINDOWS"". What makes this even worse is that he contradicted himself not once, but twice! He most likely got irritated because he was struggling to explain what he meant. The guy doesn't seem like a bad person either as he goes around asking everybody how everything is going & casually conversates with customers. He just lost his cool. I hope nobody else has to deal with this bullshit going forward & gets humiliated! Good luck, future customers with more than a party of 3 to 4. I hope the ending of your snow trip doesn't end up like mine...",2021-01-18 09:57:22,677,3093,

My first experience with them was 4 years ago my spouse and I ordered a complete custom bedroom set with all the pieces bells and whistles warranty to cover scratches or they would repair as new or replace, etc.  First their delivery people chipped a drawer on my standing men's armour.  We called about the damage. Rather than replacing the drawer they had someone come and rub brown marker on it to cover it up.  I generally don't like to make a fuss, so I let it go.  It was minor.  Some perfume oil spilled on the main dresser I did not notice right away.  I called them and because I didn't exactly know at that time the type of oil or when it spilled they told me it WAS NOT COVERED.  I was pissed off to say the least.  I took pictures sent to them and also went to the store.  They NEVER honored the agreement they sold us on nor stated when selling it we needed to give time, date, substance, etc to do what is right.  We love the furniture, especially with how much we paid for it but their service STINKS!!!

Reluctantly, the end of last year I returned to Bob's for furniture for my daughter.  Before they could try to talk us into all the extras they don't honor I told them about the last experience.  The salesman was so sympathetic especially since I told him my spouse is now dead from covid.  He checked on the former purchase, saw we came and that we have a 5 year warranty on what they should have honored.  The furniture is 4 years old now.  He said the former staff who handled things wrong was fired and they would see what they could do speaking to the manager.  I was told 3x I would get a call from Bob's to rectify the situation.  That was before Christmas.  It is now mid January and still waiting on call.

Anyway, I paid for my daughters furniture up front.  The first check they messed up and I had to go to the store with a new one.  One piece of furniture was not due to arrive until April.  The rest is due today  Tuesday 1/12/21.  Bob's was to call this past Sunday to let us know delivery time.  It never happened.  I called Monday to a phone recording to find out the window delivery schedule.   Monday night I get a text regarding delivery.  Later that night text states part of order not available.  1 hour before delivery I'm told the bed is not available until the end of the week.  They only have railings this is in addition to the dresser.  If it weren't for my daughter which is a Christmas gift I'd cancel the entire order.

Big disappointment!  They seem to like larger groups of people.  We were rushed through our meal, never asked how anything was, never approached for refills on our drinks.  A couple of other parties with several people received all of those aspects of good service.  Not to mention the owner or manager or whatever he was, again ""Ryan"" coming over to them, making conversation, etc.  Seems he knew them quite well, as well as some others coming in to be seated.  The waitress did not wait for us to finish our appetizers, before bringing out the main courses.  She plopped them down on the table leaving room for nothing else.  When we finished the appetizers, we had to wait and signal her to come over and remove those dishes.  After all that time our meals had gotten cold.  Again, she had to be signaled over, and asked to have the meals returned to the kitchen for warming up.  After she finally brought them back out, she never once asked how everything was, in spite of walking past our table plenty of times.  We noticed she did ask others who ""Ryan"" obviously knew and made conversation with how things were.  The reviewer below and others here are right.  They play favorites at this dive.  The way ""Ryan"" tried to turn things around on reviewer Shanika below is pathetic - putting on an act in public to try and con the other customers into thinking she was a regular customer when it was her first time.

Every single employee with whom I have interacted has been personable, professional, and kind. I purchased a certified pre-owned vehicle with very low miles back in November 2020 and worked with Edwin. The process could not have been smoother. Edwin was pretty new to the sales team and automotive industry in general. Yet, he did a wonderful job for us. He picked my husband and I up at our home for our test drive and we ended up driving back to the dealership in order to purchase the vehicle. As we pulled up to the dealership, I was notified that my dad was being hospitalized with double pneumonia/respiratory failure. So, we had to get the process done quickly and efficiently so that we could get to the hospital ASAP. Edwin handled the stress and pressure  extremely well. He was kind, compassionate, and just an overall gentleman. He even called me a few times in the weeks after my purchase to ask how my dad was doing (much better now ). Because we were in such a hurry to leave the dealership, and needed the vehicle to do so, they did not have time to detail it before we officially took possession of it. So, we scheduled a time to bring it back in for the detail and Edwin went to fill up the gas tank while my husband and I signed the purchase paperwork. My service advisor, Justin Vario, is the best in the universe! He goes above and beyond to make sure that I am taken care of to the highest standards. He arranged for my vehicle to be picked up at my home and taken back to the dealership for its detailing and put me in a 2021, fully loaded, loaner vehicle.  Once my vehicle detail was complete, a Royal employee came and brought it home. I also purchased some accessories from the dealership a few months later and was given another brand new, fully loaded vehicle to use while the service dept. installed them. While my vehicle was there, I asked Justin for a quote to have all of the windows tinted and he got it over to The Specialist and they got it all done for me... and I never had to leave my house! Royal's standards are like nothing I have ever experienced with any other dealership. It is so nice to be treated so well and to know that my vehicle is in good hands. This is the second Cadillac that I have owned. Once you own one, it's hard to drive anything else.

Do not visit this surgeon or his offices: Main reason I am leaving this review is simply for awareness: I went to Castellano's offices for information about a breast augmentation. This consulation was very rushed and short(only spoke with him for about 5 mins then he left) and I was told I need a breast lift on only one breast ? Also being an athlete I was looking for a particular type of procedure (over the muscle) but HE prefers doing under the muscle because, and I quote:""it looks better"", so my feelings and my actual wants and needs were not respected due to some sort of ""image/reputation"" I guess he's created with his procedures. After seeing another surgeon who's speciality alongside other procedures was/is augmentations, they were blown away by the consultation Castellano provided due to the inaccuracy and the fact that I would of had a lopsided augmentation in general. So i'd say if you are seeing him for the following, perhaps double or even triple check with another surgeon just to play it safe. Please see below his ""argument"". Any real and respected surgeon would not sit and nitpick an accurate review, instead would attempt to speak with the individual who spent a lousy $50 bucks on a 5 minute consult.

Oh and also since he chose to respond... AGAIN: I did have my augmentation over the muscle and they're lovely, two years in and plenty of heavy lifting and they still look and feel amazing.

It is incredibly rare that I leave a restaurant and don't eat every bite of food on the table. The servings at Fo Cheezy and just so damn filling that I had no chance at walking away free and clear. We had to throw an embarrassing amount of food away.

My wife and I shared two melts: the Mac N' Rib and the Seoul Brother. We both had a very tough time deciding what to order, mainly because I literally wanted to try every single one and couldn't really narrow it down. But this is what we eventually settled on. I loved both, but to be honest, barely tasted a difference between the two because of the similar sauces on both. The bread is fried and hardened, which is probably what contributed to this meal being so filling.

We also ordered the Trailer Trash Sundae which is basically every side they offer mixed together. It was great, but between the two of us, we maybe ate about 35% of it? Again: it. was. so. filling. In retrospect, I probably would have just ordered some tots and not gone with this, even though it was delicious.

The only thing that was a miss for me was the Gimme S'more dessert. Given how full I already was, this was just too much. I honestly didn't even really enjoy it. But I think even if I hadn't been stuffed, I don't think I would have loved it. I probably should have opted for one of the rice krispie treats they serve pre-packaged near the register, as I was already breaded-out.

I definitely cannot end this review without mentioning the theme and decor of this place. Combined with the cuisine itself, it really feels like something that would fit seamlessly in Seminole Heights or near USF. The fact that this is in St. Pete Beach is honestly a bit shocking. Maybe they will thrive because it's so different than anything else in the area, but it seems like it belongs in a different world. 

As we walked in, Eminem was blasting and hip hop from the 90's and 2000's rained down on us throughout our visit. The walls are painted with graffiti and hip hop symbols can be found throughout. They did an amazing job with the ambiance and that would be said even from someone that's not a hip hop fan. But again, it's so weird that it's in St. Pete Beach!

However, the experience I had tonight was incredibly frustrating and very time consuming. I arrived at Walmart about an hour prior to closing to buy a few groceries and a new bicycle seat. Since the groceries were in the very back of the store, I went to get them first, which took about 10 minutes and then I made my way over to the bicycle section where I found a bicycle seat that I liked. But, unfortunately, the seat was locked up in the transparent case (obviously for security purposes). Right next to the transparent case was a button to push for assistance. So, I push the button and waited for about 10 minutes. Nobody showed up to help me, so I walked to the front of the store and talked to a nice girl in customer service named Ashley who made an announcement over the intercom stating that a customer needed help with bicycle accessories. She then advised me to go back to the bicycle section to wait for somebody to come unlock the case for me. So, I walked all the way back to the bicycle section where I waited for another 10 minutes. Still, and nobody arrived to help me, so I walked back to customer service once again where I explained to Ashley that nobody had arrived to the bicycle section. Ashley then got on to her radio and asked if a manager could help me. About a minute went by and nobody replied to Ashley's request for a manager, so she got back on the radio and more aggressively asked if a manager could help me. About 30 seconds went by and still nobody replied, so she got her cell phone and called the manager. She did not get an answer, so she got on the radio once again and even more aggressively asked if a manager would be able to help me. About 10 seconds went by and in a rude manner, a man named Graden replied that somebody was on their way over to the bicycle section to help me. So, I quickly walked over to the bicycle section where I waited for another 10 minutes without anybody arriving. At this point, which was approximately 40 minutes after the first time I arrived to the bicycle section, the store was just about to close. About 2 minutes later, a gentlemen (who I think was a manager) walked by and asked me if I need some help. I then explained that I need to get a bike seat that's locked in the case and that I had been waiting for approximately 40 minutes. He then explained to me that he was not informed that anybody needed help in the bicycle section and that he was simply walking by when he noticed that I needed help. He then unlocked the case where I was finally able to acquire the bike seat and I made my way to the front of the store to purchase the items. Shortly after purchasing the items, I saw Ashley who genuinely apologized for the long wait. I then made my way outside and arrived to my vehicle five minutes after the store had closed. 
After digesting this experience, I really appreciate Ashley and all of her hard work. On the other hand, I do not appreciate the manager (Graden) who did not take any action to help me at all. He not only ignored Ashley's request over the intercom, he also ignored her radio requests and phone call. In totality, it took me 15 minutes to get my groceries and 45 minutes to get a single bike seat. The worst and most time-consuming experience I've ever had  at a Walmart. Absolutely terrible!",2021-01-14 10:40:04,707,3412,

After a quick over view of the menu and reviews I decided on what I wanted and went ahead and entered the drive thru. I ordered the 2 Piece Char Siu Pork Bun, the Pork Gyoza and Kiwami Shiro. 
The Char Siu Pork Bun was phenomenal. The bun was so fluffy and soft while the pork was perfectly cook on the inside. Plus the sauce that came in it was unexpected yet delicious. I believe it was a mayo based sauce with horseradish but I could be wrong. Still, a must have. Plus don't get me started on the pork gyoza. It was so tasty. Fried and savory. I could eat a 100 of those! 
Now let me get this straight, I'm a ramen/noodle fan. However, I was surprised about the flavor of their broth. It's possible it's a more traditional broth so my taste buds aren't quite use to it. It was savory and rich in flavor but not quite my favorite. Maybe I just haven't found my type of ramen broth yet but don't let that stop you from trying it! My preference is not a reflection of their hard work and dedication to their craft. The toppings and assortments of goodies in the ramen were presented perfectly and tasted wonderful. 

The drive thru is amazing specially due to the situation around the world. Helps with distancing. Be prepared to wait a bit longer than your typical fast food joint drive thru. But hey...it's ramen....In a drive thru, that's special in itself. However the wait was not bad at all. 

I'll be sure to come back and try more of their ramen flavors so I can finally find MY ramen! Enjoy!",2021-01-26 23:31:32,355,1628,

I got to try both the Buffalo with Twist & the Louise Fried Chicken Wings and I will say they were beyond delicious! Everything came to the table hot and fresh out the grease along with a side order of fries.


I look forward to going on a Monday to try the red beans and rice special which is ONLY $9.99 and comes with fried chicken which I have heard nothing but aaaaaaamazing reviews and I also heard happy hour which happens ONLY on Friday's is PHONENOMAL with drinks mixed by the one and only Boozy Chicks and 25% off appetizers 

They offer FREE WI-FI!!!!


Beautiful black owned establishment that takes honest pride in everything they doing and constantly looking for ways to improve the overall customer experience. I see such great potential in this business as it ever so apparent that the owners are passionate and actually wanna grow and get better which is amazing.

My biggest suggestion from a marketing and brand awareness perspective is the signage will need to be updated, I do feel the brand logo for Food Symphony needs to be revisited, possibly with a bolder font to ensure that it can be clearer seen especially from outside when the signage is updated. The building that it in which is sort of a shopping center type does not clearly have the actually address anywhere to make it aware that someone that is using GPS is at the 4001 block address so it could be quite confusing for someone that might not be from the area. It is understood that most of this is being sorted out and I looked forward to a bright future for this place 

It's a known fact that when the owners are present, the business be ran with dignity and it was very apparent upon my visit.

It's has a very large space with an outdoor space that will be very cool when the weather changes.   We went in blindly having never heard of this place .   We were seated promptly with no wait and very careful consideration was taken to the table spacing and seating.  The overall appearance is a mix of warehouse and industrial vibe.   The service was excellent , friendly and the waitress explained to us the house favorite dishes.   The menu has a good variety including salad , sandwiches , pizza , and small plate appetizer options.   
       We started with two cocktails.   We had the Paloma and the Godiva chocolate coffee since it was in between breakfast and lunch.   We started with the Sriracha deviled eggs, and the short rib poutine.   The egg dish was OK not amazing.  The poutine was also good it was short rib and gravy mixed with layers of very hot French fries and cheese.   It was served in a crock and definitely shareable for 2.   We opted to order the chicken and waffles and the Alabama burger .    The chicken and waffles were good there was a very distinct flavor to the dredge from the chicken.  It was not the best chicken and waffles we have ever had I think most disappointing was the syrup.   Just serve the real maple syrup.  The syrup had a blueberry flavor.   The food did come out hot.   The Alabama burger was cooked well to my liking but seemed to be a standard patty stamped burger perhaps higher quality meat but still not hand pattied.   It had some slight smoke flavor with a white BBQ sauce .   The burger was big on the tall side and messy to eat.   It was served with fries.   
         All in all we had 2 apps 2 Meals and 2 drinks for 85.00 all in with gratuity.  We both said next time we would skip the entree and have small plates.   The small plates are well portioned and well priced and there are lots of options.",2021-01-30 22:06:23,372,1910,

Placed an online order for 2 orders of 10pcs wings and an order of wedges (which wasn't even in my bag). I ordered the wings crispy. I was sitting in the lobby waiting for my order when the online screen updated and said the order was ready. So I asked an employee who had been working the carryout counter to check on my ticket because of the notification. She said she would check on it and went back to the kitchen. Next thing I know very VERY LOUDLY the employee whose name is Olivia or Liv for short yells out in the kitchen.. ""muahfuckers get on my nerves ordering crispy chicken then rushing their fuckin order,like what the fuck"" now mind you the restaurant is fairly empty so her voice carried very loud thru out the carryout section and behind. I was super embarrassed and very angry! I couldn't believe she would go and the back and yell those things about me all because I asked about my order. I asked to speak to a manager after I told Olivia how completely rude and unprofessional she was. The manager whose name was Miranda even admitted to hearing Oliva sat those things and told me she was having a bad day. This is completely unacceptable. I didn't even feel comfortable eating my food afterwards I just threw it away. Miranda offered me a gift certificate I told her no thanks because I would never ever come back to this location with such unprofessional unstable individuals working there. Very sad.

Before the pandemic we ate in today, but now we call and go pick up the order. Today we arrived at the schedule time we were given to pick up the food. However when we checked in the bag the french fries and the onion rings were ice cold. When I said something to the cashier and asked for hot ones I was told they could redo it but it would take another 20 minutes. We already waited 30 minutes to pick up the order. We also had three sandwiches that we ordered pepper jack cheese and onions on. Although we were charged for it it was not on the sandwiches. I found that out when I got home and by then I was not going all the way back to the restaurant. I called them and I was told that they would have someone called me back because I was upset. But here we are on 10 hours later and no one called me. So I'm not sure what's going on at this restaurant because the food is usually excellent, but the customer service has really gone down hill. I was disappointed that they didn't offer to give us a sandwich or more fries or something because of everything that was wrong with our order today. Good customer service goes a long ways and keeps customers coming back. I hope upper management read this post and realizes that as a loyal customer I was upset today.

We ordered directly from their website which was simple enough. Just note that there isn't an option to pay online, you pay when you pick up.

Inside the restaurant: They have put away all of the tables in the dining area and when you walk up to the counter you'll notice the counter window is completely sealed off with plastic. There are cut outs for slipping your card to pay, a slot with a flap for them to give you a receipt and a larger flapped plastic ""window"" where they pass your takeout bag(s).

The food: So.. guys, I really feel like I've been bamboozled. I thought from what I read in the reviews that the sushi would be fairly decent. We ordered Spicy Tuna roll, Philadelphia, Pink Lady, Spicy Girl, Yamato Roll and Sashimi dinner (total was around $65 before tip). The Sashimi dinner (8pcs sashimi & spicy tuna roll) was for me and I'm totally regretting not snapping photos, but the sashimi was sliced ultra thin and the ""spicy"" tuna rolls were not spicy and super small. I had one of each of the other rolls and I'm so confused on how they all taste the same..which was nothing.. absolutely no flavor. The hubs commented how the Yamato roll looks amazing and you'd think with everything that's in it (deep fried spicy salmon, cream cheese, avocado topped w/spicy mayo, eel sauce and tobiko) that there would be some flavor, but no.

Atmosphere: 
This place was adorable. It was super cozy with tasteful furniture and great decor. One of my favorite things about the cafe itself was the abundance of ( purchasable) art hanging on the walls. Behind the counter, the wall was completely lined with tins filled with different teas. I thought that was a nice touch. In general, the ambiance is really nice!

Customer Service: 
The cashier was very kind and polite. Any questions we had were answered and we even got some recommendations. This definitely added to the positive and homey vibes of the cafe. 

The Drinks: 
My dirty chai was a recommendation and I can confirm it was indeed tasty. However I do feel that it was lacking some of its signature warm spice flavor. The latte itself could generally have a bit more flavor but I suppose everyone has different preferences on the strength of their coffee. The tea was also quite good but I found that it too was missing some of that signature Earl Gray flavor. This might have been due to the addition of lavender. In the end, both drinks were good but they probably could have pushed those flavors just a bit more. 

Pricing: 
The drinks ended up being about 4.50 each which some might find a bit steep but honestly you won't find many places with cheaper specialty coffee. You're paying for the good atmosphere , high quality ingredients, and original menu. 

Overall I thought this place was super charming. My only real problem was the slight lack of some of those key flavors in the drink. I would definitely go again to try out some of the other drinks or even some of the snacks they have on the menu.

The bar service was great. Thomas took great care of us and never let us fall off of his radar. The drinks were great, special shoutout to the strawberry lemonade. The chips and salsa came out immediately and were a perfect snack to munch on while we scanned the covid friendly menus on our phones.

The real stars of the show were the guac and queso, and OF COURSE the tacos! I could've ordered 10 more of the spicy chicken tacos and my mom couldn't stop raving about the tenderness of the cilantro-lime steak. Next thing we know, we are chatting with the manager about the decadence of the steak when he goes to the back to get our new queen, the (probable) future Chopped champion, the broil highness and executive chef herself, Chef Jordan Arcuri to chat with us, and it was such an honor. And as a home cook myself, hearing about her passion was so enthralling and beautiful, just like her food. After Chef Jordan graced us with her presence, my mom and I had the cherry on top to a great meal with the house trés leches cake and it was WOW. The best way I can describe it is as a super creamy, turnt up version of strawberry shortcake.

All in all, I know that I am a new Yelp reviewer, but I wanted to save my first review for a place that I thought was a standout, and Saint Añejo is definitely worth it and should be a regular spot for all the Nashville locals and should be a destination for all my fellow travelers.

This hotel is the crowning glory of the Bottleworks District, and stepping into Bottleworks Hotel feels like stepping onto the set of a Wes Anderson film: Everything is arranged just so, but unpretentiously. The hotel occupies the top two floors of the historic Coca-Cola Bottling Plant, and fortunately, it retains many of the original features.

Entering the lobby, I couldn't help but marvel over the beauty of the hotel: the art deco-style doors and terrazzo floors, the gold details and colorful ceramic tiles. My children were less impressed with the historic architecture and more impressed with the pool table located in the lobby, but hey -- to each his own!

Our room -- the Landmark Queen, which included two queen beds -- was located in the original wing of the hotel. Among other charming details, it featured a walk-in rain shower and soft, luxurious robes to wear during our stay.

As we walked around the hotel, we discovered an old-fashioned photo booth, and a wall lined with dozens of old cameras. Each session in the photo booth costs $5, and you get both a color and black-and-white series of photos. If you'd rather not plunk down a fiver, you could always take a selfie for free by the huge wall of old cameras. It's definitely 'gram-worthy.

Some of the details that make Bottleworks Hotel unique: Each hotel door is a shiny, bright, Coca-Cola red. A grand, winding staircase at the back of the hotel features an ornate ceiling design that harkens back to its 1930s past. There are art books and couches on each floor, which invite you to stay a while and read. Lined all along the walls are black-and-white photos of people, from construction workers to rock stars. It's all these details that add up to a one-of-a-kind hotel experience.

On the first floor is the Club Room, the bar and lounge that's set up with tables and couches. I would highly suggest getting the Oceanview cocktail, made with white rum, blackberry, coconut cream, pineapple and lime. It's a tropical, milky pink concoction that I'm still thinking about. The bartender said that it's pretty popular, so jump on that bandwagon.

We loved our stay at Bottleworks Hotel, and I genuinely can't wait to stay again.",2021-01-23 19:17:44,463,2350,

But the last few times I've been there , the portions have become smaller and the prices have been on the rise. Now, given the pandemic and the totalitarian rule of NJ's Governor , many small restaurants have been forced into these measures , I understand. It's not their fault they have recoup lost revenue. They're in a tough spot , hence my visit to keep supporting them and others like them. 

The Tom Yum soup is by far the best on the menu. Their rice and chicken dishes are full of flavor. It really is excellent. Everything I've ever had there has been delicious. 

But again, I left there feeling hungry. Last time , I ordered the shrimp but with only three shrimp in a small bowl of Tom Yum,  I decided for the $10 veggie option this time. It was again spectacular in taste but with such a small portion, I wanted more. To desire more of a restaurant's food is not a bad thing, just costly.  

Also, in my opinion, a $15 lunch combo should have more than a few pieces of thin chicken over a larger ratio of brown rice. It was again delightfully tasty as the rice was moist and perfectly cooked.

Even the delicious crunchy spring rolls were as big as half the size of my index Finger. Once again, excellent taste.  Just wanted more.  I'm not looking for a buffet here , just a portion commensurate with the price. 

When it was all totaled, with tip, it was a $27 lunch. 

On a side note , the serve who was running back and forth to the kitchen was efficient but not very friendly.  Nary a warm response nor a look in the eye. 

Recap. Spotless and clean. Great, tasty food. Small portions but a little on the expensive side.

COVID setup is great outside. One use menus, everyone was wearing masks and the warmth was quite reasonable in the outdoor cubicles. 

Pretty big menu which made it a bit hard to decide, but something for everyone with lots of staple Chinese dishes. We had two carafes of sake for drinks. Would have been nice to have warm sake in the cold weather but that wasn't an option. We had pork soup dumplings and vegetarian dumplings for an appetizer. Delicious and served quickly with a nice sauce on the side. We ordered about 7 dishes total and we asked them to come out as they were ready but in retrospect that was a mistake. Things came out very quickly and filled up the table. Especially in the cold weather this made things a bit cold, so make sure you tell them to bring them out slowly. 

Dan Dan noodles were excellent as well. Not too spicy but still with a nice kick of flavor. Also had pork belly with mustard greens which came with some bok choy as well. Meat was delicious and tender and came with supplies to make little bao buns which were nice. Eggs and tomatoes were simple and well done as was the garlic eggplant. Last was the snow pea leaves which were again, very simply but done very well.

I find it really hard to believe that there aren't more queer friendly barbershops in the area, so I decided to stop in here as they also proclaimed they are taking proper safety measures during COVID. 
I selected Meghan after looking through customer reviews and finding she had the most positive feedback.
Upon entry I noticed there was several workstations separated by plexi so as to encapsulate the workstation for social distancing. In businesses I find it strange that one would chose this measure to 'block"" air from circulating as a COVID safety measure. 
Anyhow, Meghan started doing her thing and found her to be just fine for chit chat while I received my service in her chair. I did find that her technique felt a bit rushed and unrefined despite all the great feedback on her services and ultimately I had a friend tell me the back of my cut was not even. I also had severely uneven sideburns which I ended up correcting myself when I arrived home. So, I suppose that is the feedback for the service portion.
Feedback for the sense of safety while in the shop. While this business did have hand sanitizer at the check in counter and  a sign on the door notifying people that masks are required, I did find that distancing and COVID precaution were not fully being practiced. 
As a business, a sense of safety during COVID would be to only allow required staff and those getting serviced to be in the establishment so as to avoid any external unnecessary elements from adding potential harm to the situation. With this shared, staff from the neighboring ice cream business were in the shop during my service which not only added undesirable noise and commotion, but as a small space in general, did not enable the sense of safety within the shop. 
It really felt like people in here were going through the motions of practicing the bare min. requirements to operate during COVID because it is a city required law and not really because they are working to ensure a safe COVID environment for their patrons.  It can be a huge deal for someone to decide to enter a business during a pandemic to receive a service in a safe environment and unfortunately I just didn't feel like this was the safest place to visit by the way staff and neighboring employees were maneuvering and engaging within the shop. For example, having a mask on means nothing if it is also not covering your nose or constantly falling off your face.
While I really want to give my business to LGBT friendly businesses, I also value my personal health and safety and in addition to this I would also like a bit more quality when it comes to the services I am seeking to receive.

We're visiting STL and took a gamble on this poke place we saw was open later than most restaurants in the area.

First thing's first: portion size. The portions are enormous relative to what we're used to back at home, which is both a blessing and a curse. A large is truly -- large -- and should be reserved for those who are very hungry (which we were not, oops). It's difficult to notice the display with the sizes from the front of the shop (where orders are placed due to pandemic restrictions), so make sure you ask how big the sizes are before ordering.

Next thing is the quality. We tried the salmon and the spicy tuna. The salmon was on par with the best we've ever tried, and the spicy tuna was pretty good and flavorful, but a little more ""loose"" than I'd like (likely due to a relatively high sauce/tuna ratio in the spicy tuna recipe). The toppings were all fresh and high quality, and the sauces were also very good and not overpowering.

Now to the criticisms: we were slightly disappointed by the rice, which was almost certainly not ""sushi rice"" as we were accustom to from other high quality shops, but instead plain white rice. In case you're curious, the difference between plain short grain white rice and ""sushi rice"" is the addition of a few key ingredients (like vinegar) to the former -- and it makes a massive difference. If this shop started to use sushi rice, I would be willing to bump it up half a star or more as everything else is quite high quality, and the only significant thing holding it back is the rice. The rice was also bland and a bit mushy, possibly from being slightly over cooked. The majority of a poke bowl is the rice, so I feel it was important for me to really dial in on what the rice was like.

A final, more minor complaint was the takeout containers (froyo-style cylindrical paper containers) seemed a bit weird to put poke into, but maybe I'm being a bit too nitpicky here. High-moisture, steamy items like rice just don't seem as appetizing in this style of paper container. I would recommend some sort of recyclable clear plastic bowls, or really anything that is more bowl shaped.

TL;DR: Work on your rice (make sushi rice instead of just using plain white rice) and your takeout containers, and you've got a real winner here. Congrats!",2021-01-15 03:11:34,515,2427,

Domestic Draft Beer is 75¢ off and $1 off of domestic bottles and glasses of wine. My 3 favorite lite beers are on tap, Mich Ultra, Miller Lite and Bud Lite. The glasses are tall and served ice cold with very friendly & attentive service. The open-aire atmosphere of the Gulf Boulevard outside bar is welcoming for locals and tourists alike. Our first impression as long-time Madeira Beach residents was that we had really liked it and felt both comfortable and very welcome! This brand new establishment is sparkling clean and quite tastefully done, but does appear slightly lacking in the decor/accessory category and management has assured us they are just getting started in the ""accessory category"" and declared ""But Wait, there's more!"" coming soon! We then decided to try a few of their appetizers off the newly printed limited menu and were quite impressed by the kitchens performance. Our first try, ""Street Corn Dip (spicy) w/Crostini"" was a crunchy toasted bread with a very tasty & cheesy spicy dip full of Mexican street corn kernels and we just loved it! Our next sampling was the ""Seared Ahi Tuna"" with soy sauce & wasabi and it rivaled any Sushi Bar we've visited in recent past, excellent!  The arugula base was drizzled in dressing and delicious as well. Our third choice, as we're still a little hungry ... the Lucky Natcho's but we ordered it vegetarian style with avocado and added beans. This was very good with an absolutely delicious house made cheese sauce that made us completely clean the plate! After these great apps, we were still a lil Hungree so we ordered the Parmesan & Garlic Pretzel Nuggets with Beer Cheese and were simply ""WOWED"" once more! Little skewered pretzel bits with a bowl of beer cheese that was plenty for all the pretzels.
For a three day new establishment we were quite impressed by the prompt attentive service, the welcoming atmosphere and the delicious culinary offerings! We have been anxiously awaiting their opening as locals walking past almost daily for many months and were very impressed by our first visit of what we expect to be many more!

She was perfectly fine and healthy and one night she seemed to have a little weird congestion but everything (pee/poop/eat/drink/energy) was normal, so I wasn't concerned. The next day she passed away, and it was traumatic to say the least. So, we just got a baby boston on Thursday of last week (we have had her 6 days). We haven't even been taking her outside b/c she's so little and her face is so smooooshed and the breeder said pneumonia is possible and to refrain from outside for another 4 weeks if possible. So yesterday mid afternoon baby started a honking/breathing and we were terrified. I wanted to find a vet that we could go in with her. I really didn't want to be separated. Thank goodness we found this as an option. It's first come first serve and also so grateful they weren't too busy, we waited in our car maybe 20 mins maybe less before we were able to be seen. We saw Dr. Barrett and so thankful for her! She was knowledgable, caring, calming, direct, and patient with me (I'm the worst patient b/c I work in the medical field) lol. Our new baby just had an upper respiratory infection, and she's brachycephalic. We have had 2 doses of antibiotics and can tell she's feeling SO MUCH BETTER.  WE ARE THANKFUL!  Thank you Dr. Barrett!! Also quick note: I didn't feel at all like this is the place to nickel and dime you. Pretty rare to find these days.  ** Instagram: @earnestlyindigo",2021-01-21 15:58:22,328,1512,

I have always enjoyed buying my olive oils  and balsamics from small speciality shops. Especially, little mom and pop stores. Their personalized customer service always seems to go a step beyond. I find that to be true here at the, Olive Oil Marketplace. 

Moving in a pandemic and cooking more at home while restaurants are shut down for eat-in, my inventory of olive oil was getting depleted fast. While I was shopping for furniture across the street, I noticed OOM as I returned to my car. Needing to stock up on olive oil, I popped inside and was pleasantly surprised. Their offerings were as extensive as some of my favorite boutiques in STL, so I felt at ease.  

The sales associate working that day was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. She asked about my preferences and different things that I liked. She also offered me little samplings to assist me in making my decisions. I was immediately sold on the, Jalapeño Olive Oil. Her letting me sample and sharing her opinion on, Tunisian EVOO sold me. It was so smooth and it was organic, too. In addition to the two bottles of olive oil, I purchased some Italian Herb Balsamic. No kitchen is complete without a bottle of it. 

While I was checking out, they signed me up for their rewards program. Which is a good thing, because I know I am going to be a regular. Good inventory and customer service is going to keep me coming back. To my surprise, you get a small free bottle on your birthday and since mine was just a day or two away, they honored it. I selected, Hickory Smoked Balsamic. Yum-Yum!

I saw they were participating in Devour so I figured time for me to finally try them out. Overall the food was really great, but I was very turned off by the service hence the three stars. 

We got there on a weeknight at 7:25. When we got to the counter to order we had mentioned to the cashier we had never been here before. He honestly didn't say anything back in response. My boyfriend and I had looked at the devour menu (they had it in a stand on the counter, staff didn't point it out) but we actually decided to just order from the normal menu. I got the classic Philly cheesesteak and my boyfriend had a special that was written on the chalkboard. The cashier mentioned to him that it came with a side. He asked what the side options were, the cashier didn't reply right away and I pointed to the section of the board that said sides. My bf then asked the cashier what his favorite was...after a pause he said I don't know chips or fries. His tone was as if we were being a bother. They closed at 8 that night so maybe he was annoyed we were coming in, but we eat fast and left at 8pm. They had another table still in eating when we left and they had arrived before us. Back to ordering the side, my boyfriend said he would order one of the fries option with cheese and maybe some type of meat. I can't remember what the fries were but they were under the side option. The cashier seemed annoyed and was like you can just have chips or plain fries. We went with the fries. They are the crinkle fries which I usually hate, but these were the perfect crispiness and had great flavor! We wanted to each get a beer and weren't sure if you order it at the bar or there at the front cashier, turns out you order it with your food. We sat after getting our beers waiting for our food. Loved the blood orange IPA! It was great! After about ten minutes I thought they called my name from the counter. I walked over to stand there, saw three bags but couldn't see any names on them. Two employees walked by and didn't check to see if I needed help or anything. The cashier finally walked over and just looked at me like what do you want. I said I thought I heard my name called and he said no. So I went back to sit down. He came out a minute later with our tray of food and said oh sorry they did say your name. 

Like I said the food was great. I wish we would have had better service. I get that everyone has their bad days, but when working in hospitality I think it's important to not rub them off on others. Not sure if I will be back or not.",2021-01-30 19:22:12,575,2627,

A couple of weeks ago, my cat bit me. Unbeknownst to me, cat bites that break the skin are a breeding ground for infection. Unfortunately, I ended up being one of the unlucky ones who got a really bad infection from the cat bite. Initially, I used the video visit option with CVS Minute Clinic to get some antibiotics. However, I was having range of motion issues with my fingers and wrist, so the physician I saw via video chat told me she was concerned and that I should go to an urgent care facility to have someone look at my wrist to ensure there was not any nerve or tendon damage.

The infection continued to spread and got much worse, so I decided to come to MedExpress after a recommendation from a friend. I explained the situation to them and the history of the injury, specifically that the physician I originally saw at the CVS Minute Clinic told me to go to an urgent care facility. 

When the physician came into the room, he was immediately rude. He asked me what I ""wanted him to do"" for me. Once again, I explained the situation and that I was having trouble moving my fingers and wrist. He accusatorily asked me why I didn't go back to CVS Minute Clinic. I explained to him because they do not have an urgent care facility, it is a clinic. He argued with me and said yes they do. It was a VERY strange encounter. I have never been questioned why I chose to use someone else's services over another. And the entire reason I came to MedExpress was because of the robust services they provide. So, I felt uncomfortable immediately and almost felt like he was accusing me of being a drug addict trying to get pain meds (which I was never trying to get. I just wanted to know if I had a more severe underlying injury).

Then, it just gets worse. He starts moving my hand and fingers in directions, and I tell him that I cannot do some of the motions he is asking me to do because it hurts. He did not ask where it hurt (shooting pain all the way down my arm). Instead, he told me that he didn't care about my pain and that it doesn't matter if it hurts. He said of course it hurts, I have a severe infection and my hand is swollen. He then told me that if I want him to see if I have tendon damage, all that matters is if I can physically move it or not. I felt helpless and embarrassed. I have never had someone treat me so poorly when I am seeking medical help and then tell me they explicitly do not care about my pain.

After he does this, he tells me if I want to know if I have tendon or nerve damage, I need an MRI and they don't do those there. (WHAT!!! So you made my hand and wrist feel worse for no reason?!?) He said I will have to go to my primary care provider to get the MRI because they do not offer them there. He did not offer a referral to get an MRI somewhere sooner or any plan of action.

So, when I check out after being treated terribly, I have to wait for the receptionist to even notice me. I had been standing there for well over a minute before she looked up from Facebook on her phone and realized I was standing there. At this point, between the pain and helplessness I was feeling, combined with the fact that this facility did not care about me at all, I couldn't help but cry. It was embarrassing that I was a grown adult standing there crying, but after everything that transpired I couldn't help it.

So, here we are today. Despite the fact that the infection is gone, I still have sharp pains, mobility issues, and weakness in my wrist. I have an appointment with my PCP in mid-March. (Cannot get in any sooner due to COVID). Thankfully this is not a dangerous injury, otherwise I would be in trouble. I am still in disbelief by the way I was treated, the lack of resolution, or even willingness to refer me to someone who could help me.

Please do not go to this place if you value your health and want to be treated with compassion.",2021-01-21 19:38:23,889,4094,

We were surprised to see that this location is actually a food truck, but that didn't deter us. Great food comes from food trucks, and Burger Culture is no exception. They have shaded picnic tables with paper towels and cleaning supplies for you to wipe down your eating area, if you choose to eat there. Of course, you can always call ahead and take your food to-go.

My husband had the Ramen Burger, which includes a patty, lettuce, white cheese and special spicy sweet sauce. Unfortunately, they did not have the ramen buns in stock, so they offered to use the arepa buns as a replacement. He was disappointed because he specifically wanted the ramen buns and the arepas were rather hard to bite into. He would've just gone with a regular bun instead.

I ordered a Chicken Waffle Grilled Cheese Sourdough Sandwich: cheddar and American cheese, crispy chicken drizzled with honey on two Belgian waffles. I enjoyed my sandwich, especially the overflowing cheese. The waffles could have been crispier, to support the generous filling inside, but everything tasted great together. This is a rich and filling sandwich, and I was stuffed after eating one half of it.

The folks at Burger Culture are very nice and their service was speedy. They have a LOT of offerings on the menu (I was almost overwhelmed actually) so they have burgers and sandwiches for everyone. Definitely try their crazy burger concoctions because you can tell they created their menu to push the expectations of what a burger can be.",2021-01-04 16:19:26,324,1666,

Now, to all the reviewers that gave 5 stars, you have obviously never had really good quality sushi.

Now from the outside, you would think, ""Did I come to the right place?"" Because it doesn't look very appealing, but once you step inside, it has a cute dining area, and it is very clean.

I really, really, really, really wanted to like Mr Sushi. 
I have been on the search the last 2 years looking for the ""Perfect"" AYCE Sushi Location that I can settle down and call home.

Now, for the main part, the fish quality of the sushi is unfortunately not up to par with the majority of its competitors in New Jersey. It actually falls short by a lot. The only fish that was actually worth getting was the Unagi, which is the freshwater eel, and their Salmon. Their Salmon sashimi and especially their Salmon nigiri was above average compared to their competitors. 

But all of the other fish, were very bleh. And that is so unfortunate.

Now if the fish was that bad, why did I give 3.75 stars???

Reason Number 1. As most of you know, the majority of the AYCE Sushi locations in New Jersey, and Pennsylvania are owned by Chinese people. That being the case, the majority of the AYCE Sushi locations offer the same service that you get at most $8 Chinese Buffets. Miserable looking faces, no smiles, no communication or conversation, no form of service whatsoever.
THIS is where Mr Sushi is different. The service at Mr Sushi far exceeds the service at all the other AYCE Sushi locations I have been to, which is quite a lot. I always choose decent food and great service over great food and horrible service. The waitresses at Mr Sushi are awesome! Much better than all their competitors!

Reason Number 2. Their Green Tea Ice Cream, their Red Bean Ice Cream, and their Chocolate Ice Cream have a far more deeper and richer flavor than ice cream offered at other AYCE locations. Take some notes Sakana in Hamilton, NJ. 

Gas and tolls are also a bit hefty in making the trip here, but man, only if the fish quality was up to par.

They also don't have a separate lunch price and menu, so it's $22.95 all day. 

If you wanted to have a trip here and didn't know what to order, here is a short list for you.

1. Eel Nigiri
2. Salmon Sashimi
3. Salmon Nigiri
4. Japanese Sausages
5. Pork Ramen Noodles
6. Beef Teriyaki
7. Beef Yakitori
8. Shrimp Tempura, Insanely good
9. Crab Tempura
10. Spider Roll
11. Pork Bun
12. Chinese Donuts
13. All Their Ice Cream
14. Rolls weren't bad, but definitely better than their other sushi and sashimi
15. Seafood Udon
16. Miso Soup

As you can see in one of my pictures, the only sushi I ended up ordering again were the Eel and Salmon Nigiri and the Salmon Sashimi. 

But their Service and Desserts were good enough to give it a 3.75 rating.

If ONLY their fish quality was up to par to AT LEAST Masa's quality. I'm not even asking for Sakana's quality, which is the highest out of everyone out there, but Sakana just has HORRIBLE service and people skills, and they also make waaaaaaaay too many changes all the time to their prices and menu. 

If ONLY Mr Sushi could get their fish quality up, then I could call it home.

I cannot think of a better way to spend a relaxing weekend, especially if you're not a big fan of the cold or snow or both. A great way to spend time with friends and family, and seriously, this makes SUCH a cute date. 

It's so simple. You are not required to make a reservation (they actually do not take reservations at this time). Upon walking in the first thing you'll probably notice is the enormous selection of clay pieces. They range from very small knick-knacks to large vases. It's totally affordable too, priced as low as $8 to as high as $80. Pick your piece, paint it however you like. The hardest part will be waiting the week-long period for it to be fired. 

My husband and I had so much fun picking our piece, choosing the colors and applying them! I was so stoked to pick them up! The glaze goes on very light, because the clay sort of ""absorbs"" it, so I didn't really know how my creation would turn out. What an awesome surprise! My piece is the ghost plant ($22.00) and my husband painted the plant pot ($20.00). 

We are totally in love with A Way with Clay. I'm already setting dates up with friends and family so I can bring home more adorable creations and to have fun! I hope this small business THRIVES. It deserves every single award and all the recognition in the world. Thanks for bringing such a fun activity to the Treasure Valley, guys. I can't wait to be back!",2021-01-25 00:51:49,323,1457,

For such an iconic and hot Philly restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised to hear sympathy over the phone when I said we might be 10-15 minutes late to our Friday evening reservation. Sometimes this would merit a cancellation on any restaurant's end, but my dining party was met with nothing but kindness! 
So we're off to a great start before even getting a bite in.
Their outdoor dining pods could definitely use a bit more insulation, but the patron near the heater was a happy camper. I had to keep my winter coat on, but I was by no means uncomfortable.
We started by ordering the fig pizza and mushroom pappardelle. These two dishes are jaw droppingly good. The fig pizza crust is somehow a perfect mix of doughy and crispy -- the stars really aligned here. And that's just the dough -- the fig, bacon and ricotta toppings nail a balance of sweet and savory. It's not your usual pizza, but I'd say it was one of my favorite slices ever. The pappardelle pays homage to talula's roots in Kennett square and has these intricate mushrooms tossed in. It's creamy and filling, but not too much so that you're unable to touch whatever entree you have coming next. 
I got the salmon. I'd say this was the most unremarkable of the evening's fleet of dishes, but good nonetheless! I would've liked to see it cooked to more of  a crisp. The brussels, apples and sweet potatoes are a nice, farm to table-esque addition. 
Lastly, I ordered the molten chocolate cake despite being stuffed to the brim. Man, I'm glad I didn't pass that up! Best dessert a dinner establishment has ever dished out of their kitchen. The raspberry sauce is to die for and you get the perfect bite every time with a bit of the cake, ice cream, and sauce.

He knows I've been wanting to try Skyline Kitchen & Vine, so he made reservations. It was a absolutely delightful experience all the way through. 
During COVID, I've often found the atmosphere at restaurants to lack friendliness and hospitality. That was NOT the case here-even with all safety measures clearly in place the staff were kind, friendly and welcoming so the atmosphere was peaceful and relaxing. 
The highlight was by far THE FOOD!! It was OUTSTANDING!!! Delicious and fresh. I love how they bring you out a dish as soon as it's ready! We enjoyed the jalapeño poppers which were cooked to perfection and the berry glaze with it was such a perfect compliment to the spice of the jalapeño! WOW that was good! Thai chicken wraps were full of flavor. Prime filet tips with homemade gnocchi and cream sauce melted in my mouth like butter (so good I forgot to take a picture before it was completely gone). OH! And the caprese salad with the balsamic glaze was fabulous! We ended our meal with banana foster and I can honestly say was the best banana foster I've ever had.

I pulled into this garage this afternoon while in town for a doctor's appointment. Upon pulling in I observed a sign which read STOP HERE. I stopped briefly, not knowing whether to remain there and wait for an attendant or just stop to be sure there was no traffic coming from the opposite ramp. After a couple of minutes I though perhaps I should proceed since there was not an attendant standing close by. After all, the sign did not indicate to remain there. So I proceeded up the ramp. Apparently I was supposed to wait for the attendant. Ok...my mistake. I understand. Maybe I should have waited just a few minutes more. But I proceeded thinking....ok...maybe there is no attendant and I should continue up the ramp.
Then I hear the loud scream of the attendant. 
HEYYYY!!! 
Whoops. I've already proceeded up the ramp. Now I have to back down the ramp. But ok...it was a mistake. Said attendant is still yelling. I understand his frustration at this point. This could get tricky. I'm about to apologize for not understanding completely that I was supposed to wait. Said attendant begins to scream at me. Unfortunately when someone screams at me I scream back. I simply will not tolerate being spoken to in that manner when I simply made an error in judgment. 
The very first thing he says while screaming at me is ""Can't you read the sign"". Of course I can read the sign. I was just unsure of exactly how to proceed. And I said this to him in the same exact voice with which he spoke to me. VERY ANGRILY. 
He then continued verbally abusing me, calling me an idiot and telling me to get out and to never come back. AS IF I WOULD EVER CONSIDER DOING THAT WITH THE ABUNDANCE OF PARKING GARAGES IN TOWN. He said he was about to back my car out for me but not now since I was screaming back at him. I was yelling at him to never speak to customers that way. And YES...I CALLED HIM AN ASSHOLE. AFTER ALL, HE WAS!!!

He replied he would rather be an asshole than an idiot. And again, he reminded me to never come back. Now, understand I take full responsibility for my mistake. And had he been a little more understanding and treated me with a little respect, I would have apologized. Yes,I made a mistake. I get it. But it was an honest mistake. He didn't give me a chance to explain. I'm very sorry but verbal abuse is never a solution to a customer simply making a mistake. I'm not sure if this person is just an attendant or has a connection to ownership of this garage. If he is not an owner I would love to speak to the owner about this. However I am not sure what good this will do. If anyone has an idea please let me know. I was absolutely shocked at this treatment and only responded with an angry tone because of the way I was being spoken to. AGAIN...VERBAL ABUSE SHOULD NEVER BE TOLERATED. NO MATTER WHAT! I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH!!! 

Ironically, after leaving there, I called the doctors office to say I might be a little late. They informed me that if I parked in their designated garage  my parking would be validated. (IT WAS NOT THE GARAGE I JUST LEFT). All that for nothing!!!

And....the garage which the doctors office uses has a huge sign that reads: STOP HERE...WAIT FOR VALET.......",2021-01-21 02:26:46,742,3399,

Please note, Cass has program where if you use their services,  they provide you with a $75 discount coupon towards a future service. Make sure they apply the coupon before doing the work as they will not honor their own coupon!!

I asked them to come and do an estimate to install a water softener. Nice guy comes out and tries to talk me into upgrading my hot water heater as well. He quotes me $450 to install the water softener and $550 to install the water heater.  I explained i only wanted the softener done and he says OK.  Fast forward a few days and I notice I never received an estimate emailed to me. I call the office to set up the appointment and ask if they can email the quote over  to me. The dispatcher explains the price to install the water softener is $550.  Now I'm confused.  I explain to her that wasn't what the gentleman that provided the estimate had quoted. $550 was the cost to install the water heater that i never even requested an estimate for. The dispatcher was really nice and says that she will check in with her manager.  She calls me back the next day and says ""Mr Hall, you are right, I spoke with the guy, $450 was for the softener, $550 was for the water heater"" She even mentioned that she could see from the original call, I was only looking to install a water softener only so no worries.  I set up an appointment with her for the following week. Fast forward to the appointment date. No one shows up. No phone calls and I'm confused.  I call the office and get a different person that had no knowledge of my appointment and only had details on the previous work I had done.  Now this is starting to get bad. I call a different number and i reached the original dispatcher I spoke with. She can't find the appointment and has no clue what's going on and asks if she can call me back. When she does, she says that she reviewed our calls. She says the appointment should have been set, but she didn't know why my appointment wasn't in the system.  She keeps apologizing and then she says she will ask her manager about a discount and if she could call me back.  No worries but this is where things get very upsetting.  

The lady calls me back and I explain its nice that she is offering a discount for the NO SHOW but i wanted her to be aware that Cass Plumbing provided me with a $75 discount certificate which can be used on any future services. If they are going to provide any discount it would be on top of that coupon as I planned on using the coupon they provided to me.  The dispatcher then tells me, that since they already gave me a discount and reduced the installation price for the water softener from $550 to $450 they won't provide any discount for being a NO SHOW for the first appointment AND I can't use the discount certificate they provided to me for future service. 

Cass Plumbing dropped the ball and was a NO SHOW. I don't really expect a discount for that.  However they did quote me $450 to install a water softener and provided me with a $75 coupon I expected to use. 

It is extremely unprofessional to change the estimate from $450 to $550 and then act like you're doing me a favor when you change it back.  $450 was the original amount of the  estimate for what I wanted done.  You guys got the numbers confused trying to include other items.

It is extremely unprofessional to give me a coupon good towards future use and not honor your own coupon!!

These are my two complaints. Im not even going to address the poor customer service, them not showing up for the appointment or them treating me in such an unprofessional manner.

They have a lot of different options for meats and cheeses, wine and beer, and add-ons on their menu. Walking in on a Wednesday evening, it was already full with people. I was there to check it out and order takeout. The wait staff was very friendly and kept asking me if I was being helped (yes) which was a good sign. The vibe here is cozy and chill.

The first thing I ordered from here was the chef's board which involves three chef selected cheeses and three chef selected meats. The proteins came with complimenting condiments and fresh baked bread and crackers. Unfortunately, after driving all the way back home, I noticed that they shorted me one meat (only 2 out of 3). However, the owner was nice enough to comp me for the next board. The owner is really nice and will work with you on issues like that.

The next time I went in for my order, I got the ""choose three"" board. I decided to go with three different meats (as shown in my photos). My favorite was the chorizo with the sweetie drop peppers condiment. I added sliced apples, marinated olives, and cucumbers. The quality overall is pretty good, but would save my trips for special occasions due to price.

And what do you know -- as soon as one cleared, she ushered us over! They have some nice string lights in there which wakes for a cozy vibe. 
My two friends started off by ordering the peppermint mocha and were very impressed. I placed an order for the pumpkin pie cappuccino a bit later. 
The timing of my ordering was unfortunate, as my food came out with it. I therefore couldn't fully enjoy two things at once! My cappuccino was getting cold but I also needed to tend to my food! What to do! It was a lovely and comforting drink, though. 
For the food, we all ordered the huevos rancheros and then shared a plate of their infamous cannoli French toast. Honestly, I struggle to see why this is their all-star plate. The brioche was AMAZING but I had a slight issue with the cannoli side of it -- the filling had a weird lemon-y aftertaste and was really nothing like a true cannoli's consistency. I'm not sure what the pistachios had to offer, either. The huevos rancheros was awesome -- highly recommend this plate. 
They also have a 10% off deal for any student!! Make sure you take advantage of this when you check out this fun little spot!",2021-01-19 17:43:14,368,1752,

At no time was I told animal could be a carrier of disease and spread to other animals. Brought the cat home and within several days my 13 pound male cat started acting sick little did I know that he had contracted the calici virus from the kitten. He was so sick not only did we have to give him several different medication's but for two weeks had to give him fluid with a needle every day because he was so dehydrated cost was $500. A couple weeks after that he got an infection in his nail from the virus at this point I'm over $1000 for medical treatment. Two weeks after that I notice he's having trouble eating. Again I take him to the vet another $400 and I'm told he has an infection in his mouth due to exposure to the virus. Only thing to do was have all his bottom teeth removed to eliminate the infection the two weeks leading up to the surgery he could only eat if he was on painkillers otherwise he slept all day The surgery was $1400. The day of the surgery finally came and I was excited that he would finally be feeling better at this point he only weighed 6 pounds. The day the surgery occurred  a couple hours later I got a call from the vet that my cat had died under anesthesia. This cat was one of  my best friends I had him for 12 years. I learned that this disease is easily spread from secretions from infected animals. Imagine how many affected areas are at that shelter, it is HIGHLY contagious! You should buy a kitten from a location that is isolated and limited to kittens that are not surrounded by dozens of potentially infectious animals! It's an absolute breeding ground for disease! The hate and animosity I have for the hermitage cat shelter knows no bounds. My children are devastated and now resent the cat that we bought from the shelter who is the sweetest thing ever and of course isn't to blame. Maybe they should have someone come to my house and explain that to my children. If you decide to buy a kitten buy one out of a box on your own, all the fancy procedures and nonsense they tell you there about buying a healthy kitten is just a scam. There's nothing medically sound about the animals they are selling you! We miss our friend! RIP Oliver",2021-01-18 06:11:00,460,2254,

I started going to their Langhorne location and eventually transitioned over to the Richboro location a few years ago. I am pretty diligent about keeping regular with my eye exams as my family has a history of glaucoma. Dr. Mila Batushansky is superb when it comes to eye health. She performs a very comprehensive and robust exam every single time. This includes looking at the back of my eye as well as measuring eye pressure.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out years ago that her office boast state of the art technology that allows you to do that. Eventually, after having kids, I started bringing them in for exams as well. She is equally as great with kids as she is with adults. Dr. Batushansky was the first eye doctor that convinced me to try contact lenses. She was very patient with me while I tried on multiple brands during the first few months of wear until I finally found the ones I liked. They offer contact lens ""training"" for beginners that helped me learn how to put them in and take them out. 
The office is very welcoming and comfortable, although there isn't even much waiting involved as they really do keep to appointment times. The front desk staff is very helpful and knowledgeable. On many occasions they would speak to my insurance to get resolution. 
I also love that they offer variety of frames for every price point. To date, I've gotten multiple, including designer brands. 
Overall, I've recommended this office to all of my friends and would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a very knowledgeable, up to date with latest technology, well-studied and well-read doctor.",2021-01-22 19:16:04,325,1676,

It was like $32 each way, and when I got to Reno & asked how much for a cab ride and was told $170.  So duh, I chose the shuttle.  The counter was shut down and I had to blindly listen to people in the airport who told me where to go and that it would come.  Not sure when, but eventually there would be one.  Ride from airport to Tahoe was fine.  My driver had like two teeth on the bottom, but he was nice and got us there.

The way back from Tahoe to the airport was the dicey one.  At 7:30 am, my driver shows up five minutes late.  That alone, I could handle.  He had long flowy gray hair that he liked to tousle and had seventies rock on the radio.  I think he was definitely still stuck in the seventies.  I sat in the row behind him and the part that scared me is I could see his eyes bobbing and close several times while we were driving the dangerous curves down the mountain.

I should mention also that while the rest of the town was doing a really good job with COVID, Mr. Gray Hair 70's dude had a bandana around his neck and never put it over his mouth and nose.  This is not cool, as if anyone comes into contact with a bunch of different people who could easily spread COVID, it would be an airport shuttle driver.

Honestly, I may be jaded as I have worked as in house counsel for one of the largest insurance companies in the US.  But this guy looked like he smoked a bowl before he picked us up early in the morning and I was frankly terrified the whole ride.  Thankfully, we made it there, but whoever is running this business, please make sure to pay your insurance premiums and have high limits.  This shuttle co. is a disaster waiting to happen.

EQNfESG2jIEolDI3XqmJdA,14WeUBavXkLZg-p_HLNIbA,2Mg2DziYfmUd5BKYfDQPGQ,5,4,0,3,"Early on in my wedding planning process I knew I did not want to have basic wedding food. I wanted to feed my guests something that would tantalize their tastebuds! And, honestly, I didn't want to end up eating a bland chicken breast with mashed potatoes. My husband I actually automatically threw out most potential wedding venues if the catering options were limited. We knew we wanted Cherry Bomb to provide our first dinner as husband and wife. 

What really makes Cherry Bomb special is the level of professionalism and excitement that Dawn and her team had for our wedding. We started out with a plan for a 90 person family style dinner intended to bring our friends and family closer together, and Cherry Bomb was excited to work with us curating a perfect spread. (Obviously, this was pre-pandemic.) By the beginning of summer, we didn't know what the status of our wedding would be by September. However, Dawn did not hesitate to keep an open line of communication regarding all COVID compliance changes. There was so much compassion and flexibility towards us as the client--even in the event of a postponement or cancellation. We didn't even get another bill from Cherry Bomb until we were able to solidify our pandemic wedding plan. Our headcount eventually was reduced down to about 25 (including some meals for some other vendors). Even though we upgraded our meals a little bit (hello, filet Mignon and lobster), the final invoice was substantially less than the original plan. Even though we ended up spending much less money Cherry Bomb's stellar customer service never wavered. 

The food was of course totally the bomb! We were the first tasting in their new kitchen, and Chef Kelsi definitely impressed our parents and us! We had no complaints, and Chef Kelsi delivered a magnificent feast on our wedding day! Every single person on the crew was fantastic--especially, the one who helped me with the door as I made my grand entrance to walk down the aisle. I can't even thank Dawn, Kelsi, and the entire Cherry Bomb crew enough for being the rock that my husband and I needed in order to pull off the perfect pandemic wedding against all odds. I wish I could give more stars!",2021-01-09 06:26:07,428,2195,

Something is on your mind, and by something I mean the full weight of your existence. As you navigate the throes of your recurring existential crisis, you find a light. Not necessarily at the end of the tunnel because you are quite far from that location - more of a lantern. Its illumination is yellow in hue. You walk up to its steamy doors with the sounds of pans blanketed with carbon and grease from the orders of local and global travelers. 

As you enter, your only greetings are the swift and demanding thoughts of ""where do I start, and when will my order end."" Now during these unfortunate covid times you sloppily try to dig your QR enabled device from your pocket. As you pause your Blues Traveler song, because WH requires all of your brainpower at this moment, you notice that your camera app opens on the front camera. You get a glimpse of yourself, you pause, but realize there is no time to wipe the drool from your cheek. Unfortunately, this QR code opens up a Vimeo playlist about WH's holiday cheer and whatever additional content their unconnected marketing team decided to confuse you with further. Now, at this moment, you are lost - thinking ""where the f*** is the menu! No worries, I know it by heart"" and it begins. Jamie, a man that sharpens his pen and rolls up his sleeves, because as he knows, you are here for more than just nourishment - the hole inside your stomach is as deep as the shovel length craters that Shia LaBouf so painstakingly dug as the heat and yellow spotted lizards watched over.

You start with a trip into the classics, an All Star, as the lyrics ""L on her forehead"" scream in your mind, you yank your focus back to the moment - ""add cheese to the grits, please"" Sausage, side of hash ""All the way."", a T-Bone, or maybe some pork chops - I go T-Bone because hell, it's New Year. Jamie now takes a moment to give you the most financially responsible path - semantics. 

It is decided; you sit for a moment that feels like a guided meditation so familiar to you from this morning's Calm app. The symphony of sear. The ballet of short-order cooks. You begin to question if you purchased a one-way ticket to Moscow, where Sergei Prokofiev is your only dining companion. The performance by your hosts is nothing short of Oscar-worthy. Not only has it been rehearsed time and time again, it is truly embedded in the subconscience of the athletes that flip eggs and bacon before your eyes. Malcom Gladwell is kept up at night knowing that 10,000 hours could not simply teach any human to do this - these mortals were preordained. 

As you continue to sit, you contemplate how the agricultural revolution was a pivotal moment for sapiens to dread its ever so commanding existence. ""How could one establishment serve 272 Million eggs a year? With food not being the issue, what is? My likes on instagram? Does the color on my bedroom's accent wall give off the right tone? And who ever did let those canines outside?""

The food arrives in waves, a pecan waffle ""Hey, I forgot I ordered that!"" perfectly cooked yet still requiring an honest bath of semi-melted butter and a dredge of homogenized corn syrup colored to look like the stuff that hails from our friends up north - delicious. Steak, no garlic herb butter here or thyme basted with the juices of a fallen bovine friend. Simple, seared, salted, and cheap, but nevertheless, honest. Mix the overeasy eggs with the cheesy grits?.. of course. Pause, jelly your toast but do not retreat. Jamie arrives again in your journey through this psudeo-avant-garde tasting menu - ""you want chili on those hash browns, right?"" as you glance at him with an expression only known to those who go to mass on Sunday - he pauses, turns around, and puts chili on the hash browns.

Your stomach aches with feelings only one could imagine having after singing your first duet back in 2nd grade music class, a feeling that makes you dread the day you ever sang from your throat, a feeling so rewarding once Mrs. so-and-so told you ""breath and sing from your stomach"" you think to yourself ""did she mean soul??""

You wipe your cheeks and say a brief prayer to whatever omnipresent deity or spirit you decide to follow at this point in your life... and exit. One deep breath of the 70 degree New Orleans December air and you simply exist again, nothing more, nothing less.

You lie awake in bed after you return to what you believe is your home, but as you and the souls you encountered tonight know - the only home is down the street at your local Waffle House.",2021-01-01 22:50:01,948,4606,

There slogan says it all. I have had Taco Cow on my to do list for a while now and finally stopped in. The restaurant is easy to find and locate right on Overland Road. Inside you will find a ton of funky stuff all relating to bulls, tacos, and plenty of puns. Seating inside is limited to a couple of tables and window side stools. 
The owners offer a good selection of online/delivery options which was great to use given Covid-19. 
Speaking of selection....how about 35 taco options!! Yip...35. They have something for almost everyone. For me, I went with 4 tacos today....which leaves me with 31 to go...
I ordered the Fish Frito, Carne Asada, Kurobuta Carnitas, and KC Chief. All the tacos were served with fresh in store made tortillas which is a game changer. The restaurant also provides tasty green and red sauce....grab both!
The Carnitas was my least favorite of the four. The pork was a bit flat on flavor imo. The Carne Asada was tasty along with the guac and cheese along side it. My second favorite of the options was the fish taco. Don't let my horrible photo deter you. The very crispy coating provided a great crunch and the fish inside was not dry. The cabbage added additional crunch and flavor. Great taco.....ohh...it's huge too!!! Largest portion of the 4 by far. Last but not least, the Super Bowl Champs, KC Chief! The flavor of the meat was great! The BBQ sauce added a great twist to the taco. I highly recommend the KC!
If you are looking for some unique tacos with tasty ingredients, you will not go wrong with Taco Cow.

Whenever I think of a restaurant on mass all it comes to mind is bars that have restaurants with one or two special things that they are known for, I must say that I've passed by this restaurant many times and didn't call my attention; I guess the name doesn't tell you a lot about it or probably the outdoor part not calling my attention but if you're reading this and you want a nice fancy dinner in downtown please go inside!

I was there with a group of friends, we made a reservation for 9 people and following CDC guidelines and all we were given sanitizer, asked for face masks and given our own section which was very cozy, with a mid volume music and a screen showing some burning logs inside a chimney everything suited perfect to enjoy ourselves while being able to talk. The restaurant has a great design and with everyone wearing formal clothes makes it even better.

I apologize since I didn't grab quite well our waitress name but she did an awesome job, so thank you mid 30s, 5'5"", blonde girl with eyeglasses. Even though the night was busy you managed to be very patient, got our orders right and our drinks fast; everything was awesome.

Now, getting to the food. I read many yelp reviews about this restaurant and from the most reviewed dishes, I picked the ""Pan Roasted Chilean Sea Bass"". I hesitated for a minute while reading a yelper saying that hers was overcooked but since it was repeated on the pictures it seemed a good choice so I took the risk.

Needless to say this was one of the best fishes I've tried. It was flawless, crispy on the outside (did you guys do it with those little torch lighters?) and the inside was very tender and tasty also the sauce that was around it was excellent.

As a side my gf picked the onion rings and thank god they ran out of them so we get to try the BWI Cauliflower which seemed to be cooked in the oven and placed on top of homemade hummus which was very smooth.

Our wine selection was a Kono - Pinot Noir from New Zealand that we enjoy, smooth with a strawberry taste.

Now my gf choice was the Seafood Pasta which was generous portion of marinara mixed with linguine pasta with shrimp, mussels and asparagus. Very good flavor but I believe adding cherry tomatoes makes it more acidic taste and I rather enjoy a hearty tomatoe sauce.

We couldn't reach the dessert section since we had appetizers at a bar but we will be back for sure!",2021-01-18 01:07:38,506,2468,

We had been going to their place for years every time we're in Reno...always getting our breakfast bagels and cronuts. So, I went to pick up my order yesterday and my cronuts were not made...I was bummed, but oh well. I'm in Reno celebrating my birthday & wanted to get all my favorite goodies.

Well, someone called me this morning and told me that my cronuts were ready for pick up.  When I got there to pick them up, I asked if I could buy a couple of bagels,  no problem.  Well we were waiting a short few minutes before she came back...she had baked us some fresh bagels to go with schmears! She was so nice...I offered to pay for them, but she said it was ok because of inconvenience.

I stumbled upon this restaurant while going to pick up some groceries from next door when I realized that I was hungry and they just opened for the day. This is probably one of the first places that I just went in blindly without looking up reviews or Instagram posts to see what others said, so I was a little worried when I realized this after I ordered. The decor was nice, the staff was very friendly, and overall nice ambience for a small restaurant.
I knew I wanted pho so I quickly perused the menu just to see what else was there but was ultimately there just to eat pho. I ordered the pho Dac Biet and boyyyy was I happy when it came out. You could see how clear, but rich the broth was with all the thinly sliced meat placed perfectly and bite sized meatballs and just enough of onions, cilantro, and green onion without being over whelming. I usually like to taste my brother before I add anything in it because I hate the ruin a good bowl of pho by altering it with adding bean sprouts, lime, sriracha, and hoisin (hold the Nuoc mam because I've had many accidents with it). As soon as I tasted the broth, I knew it needed nothing else! There's only one pho that I can eat without adding all the extras and that's my dad's. I was very pleasantly surprised at how good this was, dare I say maybe better? (Ah, can't) than my dad's, that I did not even need to add a single drop of anything to it. The broth was so clear and fresh, not frozen(and if it was, it wasn't for long). It had the perfect balance of saltiness with natural sweetness. It definitely tasted like it was just finished this morning and had not been simmering all day/week like other places. The cuts of meat were so perfectly thin and the brisket, oh the brisket, was freshly cut with a little marbling for flavor. I hope everyone has a bowl like mine because it honestly could not have been better. Well, I think a little tripe would have been good but I can do without it especially since it had many pieces of tendon. I can't say that I'm a pho connoisseur, but I am pretty picky and I thoroughly enjoyed this. I felt very passionate about this bowl of pho, which is very strange because I grew up in New Orleans with many pho restaurants, many Sunday morning memories, and I have not felt this way about pho except when I get a bowl of my dads.
Anyway, it's $12 for a taste of pure comfort. I wish I lived closer to make this a regular spot of mine but may be worth the trip anyway when I crave an incredible bowl of pho.",2021-01-22 16:38:39,564,2597,

We were able to order online for takeout that was ready within 5 min of the stated time, though they initially handed us the wrong order (luckily, after a few similar mishaps at various restaurants during the pandemic, we didn't make it out of the parking lot before we realized). 

We ordered the Nutty Goat salad as an appetizer, which was fairly large and packed with mixed nuts and goat cheese. The blood orange vinaigrette was tasty as well.

My Salmon BLT was delicious --- standard BLT with added roasted salmon. I opted for their sweet potato waffle fries on the side, which were also good, though I wish they came with a dipping sauce. 

BF ordered the turkey burger, which sounded good on paper, but he was disappointed with the rubbery texture of the burger itself. The accompanying fries were solid though.

We finished the meal with the Limoncello cake, a light, fluffy cake that was a good balance of sweet and tart lemon; the piece was large enough for us each to have a few bites (but was a little small for the price). 

We didn't get drinks this time, but appreciated that their taps feature some local breweries --- love to see the local love! 

I do look forward to going back, but my one comment is that their menu is very limited in terms of vegetarian options (and I'm not even sure they have anything vegan other than maybe the soups) --- the only vegetarian entree is the option to order meatless Chicken Alfredo. I hope they add more plant-forward, healthy options in the future.",2021-01-10 14:40:54,329,1646,

I have been trying to support restaurants that are following the governors orders and was under the impression this was one of them. I called ahead and was told they were offering outdoor seating and that they still had seats available. I felt deceived when I walked in with blankets prepared to sit outside, and saw only people sitting inside. I drove 20 minutes so I didn't want to just walk straight out, so I tried to eat outdoors but they don't have any heaters to make it bearable. We ended up moving inside, which I will say there were only 4 other tables inside so we were far enough away from them.

Now for The Good!!: I am always impressed by Brick & Brews ingenuity. Their cocktail creations are out of this world, and their food is absolutely delicious. I am one of the pickiest eaters I know, but I always trust their menu and order items without substitutions. I have been blown away by their meals and tonight's didn't disappoint! My husband and I split two sandwiches- the Fried Chicken Sandwich and the Short Rib Grilled Cheese. Both were delicious but the Fried Chicken Sandwich was the most impressive to us! We also ordered fried pickles as an appetizer and this is the first place I have ever been to that had ribbon style fried pickles. Not sure if they were my favorite as they broke apart when you tried to dip them in the chipotle sauce they came with, but they were unique & yummy. 

I know they are doing whatever they can to stay in business. I think having heaters outside would be more inviting to people who are willing to dine outside but not yet comfortable inside, as well as it would catch passerby's attention if they saw people dining outside. But if you are comfortable dining in- definitely check this place out. You won't be disappointed & the atmosphere is awesome.",2021-01-03 04:12:24,387,1937,

When I first purchased it, I was a newly single mom who just moved to Center City and did not have very many people that I could trust, let alone someone in a field notorious for dishonesty.  In every dealing that I have had with Ken and his team (at least once a year during inspection time), he has always taken the time to explain what the issue was in an incredibly thorough manner, not just answering my questions, but also educating me in either how to better maintain my vehicle and/or prevent the issue from happening in the future.  When my new husband entered into my life, the first couple of times he helped me compare and research other mechanics and shops to make sure we were in the best hands, and he found out the same thing I did - that there is no place we would rather take our vehicles. My car has 207,000 miles on it and over the years, I've had breaks, suspension system, exhaust system, tires, batteries, and muffler taken care of here. Most recently, the catalytic converter was stolen off of my car while parked in our indoor parking garage. (BTW Prius owners be aware! This is a super common part stolen off of our cars where thieves can literally make tens of thousands of dollars on an overnight spree cutting these off our precious Prius vehicles). Not only did Ken have my car back to me in two days, I asked him about a cage that I can install in my car to prevent this from happening again (this is a $1,500 issue).  First, he let me know that the thief who stole my catalytic converter did an amateur job, so he didn't have to charge the full price to replace, he also let me know that no one will steal a replacement part and that I didn't need the cage either. Twice, twice my friends, Ken could have gotten extra mula from me, especially now that I trust him so much, but he didn't. What more could you want in taking care of your precious vehicle?

I didn't want to write this review but I feel like I have a duty with over 5k reviews here. It was our first time in Nashville and we were only here for one night. I saw all of the amazing reviews and just knew we had to come here.

I love this place in theory.... in practice though, not so much. The staff was really nice, the manager? owner? was very hospitable and attentive. The vibe is a chill hangout spot type, very cleanly space.

So we walk in, stand in line for about 5 minutes and then place our orders.
I order the southern sandwich with mac and a mild wing on the side. My husband orders the mild sandwich with fries. I ask if their peach cobblers are served warm, they are. Perfect, we order 2 peach cobblers a la mode. The server asks us if we'd like them to indicate that the cobblers should come out later so we have time to eat our meal first and then eat the dessert with the cobbler still warm and ice cream still cold. We love this idea, we're excited! We pay and take a seat.

The food comes out quickly enough. The mac was kind of dry, okay taste but mostly pretty bland. The chicken sandwich came out hot and fresh; it looked great! Golden, crispy, good-sized. And then I bit into it and it was the bad kind of crispy - dry, not tender or juicy at all, hard, scraped the roof of my mouth. The patty and the breading were both pretty bland, the sauce and cole slaw didn't contribute much. I try the wing and it's actually decent. Not sure if that's because it was a bone in piece or maybe the mild flavoring? I'm noticing a lot of the positive reviews are from people who ordered spicier levels, so I'm wondering if this is a place that relies on heat for flavor. My husband was even less impressed with his meal.

We let the server know we were ready for our cobblers. They come out and the portion sizes are huge! I thought this might be the saving grace. The first bite of the ice cream tasted like subpar off-brand supermarket vanilla. The cobbler... was just soggy peaches in crisp breading and syrup. I took several bites looking for the nuances in taste - cinnamon, brown sugar, butter? Nope, just syrup, not tasty at all. I knew finishing it would be a sentence to a night with an achy stomach and so I stopped eating it once I knew it wasn't going to get any better. I still had the gurgles for a few hours. My husband ate considerably more of his cobbler as he didn't want to waste food and well... he regretted it.

Overall, if I lived in the area, I MIGHT have been willing to come back and give their plates a try just because I liked everything about the place except the food lol. But being from out of town, unfortunately if I'm ever back this is a no-go for me.",2021-01-15 23:23:51,604,2738,

This time I had just taken the doggo to the park and was passing by and decided last minute to grab some burritos for late lunch. This second time around I remember why I haven't been back since our first visit here even though it is only less than 1/2 mile from our apartment.

I arrived at drive-thru at 1:36PM with one vehicle in front of me. Twenty-five minutes later the car hadn't moved an inch! There are few folks at the outside seating area so a little wait is understandable. However, I remember our first trip here also had quite a wait and there were only two people in front of us.

Thirty minutes later the vehicle in front finally moved. BUT WAIT for this... the person in the vehicle was an employee and he BLOCKED the drive-thru lane!!! The entire time I thought he was also waiting at drive-thru. When I got to the window I let the clerk know and I was told, ""Oh, sorry, he was just dropping off something real quick"". Thirty minutes was definitely not real quick, and for the love of all doggos park, man!!!

The burrito was alright, not good enough to return anytime soon MOST ESPECIALLY with this wait time.  And I requested two of each of green and red salsas and when I got home only found green in bag. Paid almost twenty bucks for two burritos with a total wait time of almost 40 minutes. With that amount of time, I could have driven to Adaldertos, paid less for two HUGE California burritos and be back home in less than 30 minutes. So not worth it.",2021-01-02 22:15:00,325,1538,
iTj0ufxKr-SzRIsgIRuzdA,NnIx35qoj05L92dcqarEIA,e7MuP7eVxgKp2EkYrv3sFA,3,0,0,0,"I love the southern style chicken sandwiches and I always try a new one when it comes out! (Yes I was in line at Popeyes!) 

The good: 
The fries had great seasoning on there, my daughters demolished the fries. Whatever that is, keep it up! I dipped it in the Mayo that came on the spicy sandwich and it was amazing! 
The Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich had extra seasoning on it, and the batter gave it that extra burn, and the spicy mayo helps to cool down the taste buds, good combination of flavors! I do think that the actual ""Nashville"" hot flavor was a bit different than what I usually experience but it wasn't bland. But maybe experiment a bit to give it more of a ""savory"" flavor not just a ""hot"" flavor. 
The tenders also had a good batter flavor, not much of a need to add any salt or pepper to it! Went great with ketchup. 

The not so good: 
While the flavor was good, the chicken was dry on both the tenders and the sandwich. :( I had high hopes for this sandwich and from the looks of the picture I thought it was more similar to the huge filet that Popeyes has but this was closer to a Chic-Fil-A filet. I do think it is possible the sandwich was made earlier and that is the reason it was dry, I am willing to give it another shot and see if it comes out juicer if I request it freshly made. (I ordered DoorDash delivery on this and it came fast!) 

I also think my fries weren't made fresh, and may have already been in the warmer because they weren't very hot when I got them. I live about 2 minutes from the restaurant so it couldn't of gotten that cold that fast! 

Nothing is better than a JUICY chicken filet sandwich and I have to see if these sandwiches are juicer next time because if they are, it will be my new favorite chicken sandwich spot.",2021-01-07 00:18:43,385,1770,

Listening to them between regular talk and taking 5-6 calls b4 ever break, that's just to ridiculous for me had to hang up due to my frustration. Let me be upfront I'm a major BRONCO'S FAN and i think the Eagles should draft WR Smith w/ 6th pick J. Hurts is a sneaky monster who needs just alittle time to shine bright. Then trade Carson Wentz and Zack Ertz to the Patriots for there 15th pick and take TE Kyle Pitts(If gone and Surtain there take him) Pitts is 6'6 230ish offensive nightmare to cover needs work blocking that will come. In the 3rd-5th rd take O-line Center an guards help rebuild the Defense in next yr draft. I would also make a trade to Bronco's for Tim Patrick 6'2ish 210 and DaeShawn Hamilton 5'10ish 160lbs am can fly. Tim is big fast an sure handed don't want to lose him especially w/ Courtland coming off of a ACL injury there are just to many weapons right now for Denver an going to lose him for nuttin like Denver did when they drafted Shaq Barrett let him walk bcuz of Chubb being drafted. An Barrett is going to get a major contract after this Super Bowl for possibly having a Von Miller(SB50MVP) style of game. Who the Eagles might be able to sign in FA to sure up there pass rush. I do believe if Eagles can pull off those moves for Offense they will be set. And getting Barrett will help jump start there D.

UOHSqziLgSoyxj2C69acVg,mphvb6MRmPgnIT8pmU-x0w,hujxUyxa9vXRjJdY18LyWw,3,3,1,3,"Alas, my first time back at an AYCE sushi restaurant since sheltering began and my diet took a complete 180. My partner took me here to try since he knew they had some veggie friendly options and a good selection of nigiri. I love sushi and was eager to see what this spot was all about.

2 Tha Joint is a prison-themed restaurant and the interior definitely gave me club vibes. Tables were spaced out but because they don't offer outdoor dining, it really will be up to your comfort level eating inside. Fortunately, we were seated in the private room with only one other patron so I was good.

For lunch, their $20 AYCE includes nigiri, rolls, and dessert. We don't normally get dessert included in California so I was pretty surprised. Sadly none of the options are dairy-free so if you are vegan, you will need to settle for something sweet elsewhere.

- Rolls - My favorite was hands down the ""Sexy House Wife,"" which was cooked scallops, pepper powder, greens, and topped with yellowtail. It contained little additional sauce and the flavors were packed. This is likely one of their healthier rolls that doesn't rely on sauces or deep-frying anything to make it delicious.

- Nigiri - These were all okay. I love my salmon nigiri but the salmon here just did not pack the flavor that I wanted. Other fishes were also decent but I've had better nigiri at other buffets. Still, the rice to fish ratio was fair here so I give them a plus for that.

To my fellow plant-based eaters out there, they do offer 6-7 veggie rolls as part of their buffet. Only one is vegan but I'm sure you can ask to sub-out an ingredient or two to possibly make it so. Although I appreciate my partner taking me here because they had options, nearly all the rolls had fried ingredients which is something I try to avoid. Remember, just because it's vegetarian or vegan, doesn't necessarily mean it's healthy.

Overall, I enjoyed my experience here with my first AYCE experience in months. I just wish there were more rolls that I could enjoy without something being fried or doused in sauce. However, the service was wonderful, food was good, and safety is taken seriously as much as it could.",2021-01-29 21:40:58,443,2174,
C3jSUSt2twr-Sv9AJl8cUg,8iW9RJYAoSzClNn8lNpLqQ,p-MSh95si_sDdih94gyKuw,2,1,0,0,"One of the strangest dining experiences I've ever had.

Pros: 

The Owner / Chef, the busser and most of the staff were extremely friendly. Some of the food (Tasso Ham & Black Truffle Beignets & Roasted Monkfish) was absolutely fantastic. The cocktail composure / wine was great.

Cons: 

The food was wildly inconsistent (Philly Style Clam Chowder had more sand in the clams than the AC Boardwalk, Parisian Gnocchi was mostly salt, Crab Imperial Stuffed Trout was cooked well but the crab meat was dry (sitting under the heat lamp?).

Meal pacing was non-existent. We arrived 5 minutes before our reservation and ordered our drinks / full meal during our first server interaction. The drinks took 5 minutes to appear and the appetizers 35ish minutes (no one came by during this period we just sat with empty glasses) this somehow lead to the server trying to speed up the meal (Which given the current restrictions make sense BUT it was the kitchen's slow delivery of the food throughout the meal that extended the dining time.)

The bad:

Things fell apart while we were finishing the main course, everything up until this point was fine and honestly I would usually chalk it up to a place that's not for me. The server kept coming to the table. I assumed this was an attempt to make up for the choppiness at the beginning of the meal....how wrong I was.

We ordered desert (Caramelized Plum Upside Down Cake...so bad) and two drinks. Our server inexplicably took the order and came right back with our  drinks, no desert and the bill (which included the desert). When they came back we showed them on the bill that we were charged for the dessert. She didn't apologize just shrugged and said ""you did order dessert"" walking away while leaving the check on table. She came back with the dessert quickly  but she could have said ""Let me grab that"" or literally anything so we weren't as confused. 

We paid the bill while eating desert and the total bill came out to $186 and we tipped $40. We ordered an Uber to head out (~6 minutes wait time) and the same server came to the table and began picking up dishes / cleaning. Out of normal decency we said we ordered the Uber and will be out of her way in a minute.

She responded with ""There's heat lamps outside for you to wait at, there's other people waiting for the table........""

I'm fine with time limits on tables, I'm fine with mistakes on entering food or bringing them to to the table. It's unacceptable for every course to come out late, forget items but still charge for them and end it with ""get out"" when 99% of the mistakes were on the restaurant.",2021-01-31 20:42:09,541,2612,

We both agreed that this one of the better ones. We were a little bummed because they were out of several of the items we wanted to try after reading other Yelp reviews. What we did end up with was awesome and I will rate them below. 

The cafe itself is cute. It seems like it would be fun to hang out in if it wasn't during COVID. Right now they are taking all the usual recommended measures. In addition to the Decor, They also have a gender neutral restroom.

The prices are on par with most of the other gluten free places in town. The number of choices are similar to a local coffee shop. They serve coffee drinks, some sandwiches, salads and basic breakfast.  We decided not to purchase any food because they don't make their own bread. It would be awesome if the owner came up with some good bread recipies (sandwich, English muffins etc.) because the baked goods are awesome. Or perhaps come up with more creative options if they're going to continue to use canyon bake house. I can just make most of the same food at home cheaper. But if you're looking to hang out, it's not a bad choice.

Baked goods we tried:
Toffee cookie. 7/10. Like most gf places this is a crunchy cookie. Great flavor but really, really crunchy!

Apple fritter. 10/10. Uh...they nailed this one. Better than most gluten fritters I've had. And I've had many.  would be nice if it was a tiny bit bigger so you'd get more of the soft middle part.

Carrot cake cupcake- 9/10. This was awesome! Soft and moist at room temp. Lots of real carrot and great frosting.

Oreo cupcake. 9/10. Features new gf Oreo. Delicious chocolate cake part and awesome frosting!",2021-01-30 23:19:56,377,1753,

I am very glad that I decided to stop in on to grab a doughnut & coffee and stay to study a bit. When I first walked in, I was surprised at how big of a space it was! We walked up to the counter to take a look at all of the doughnut options, which I was surprised by the unique types that they offered. I ordered the cookies & cream one that is covered in crumbled Oreos on top of chocolate and filled with a sweet buttercream. It was delicious and had a great ratio of chocolate to buttercream, but it was definitely an undertaking to finish. I nibbled at it for the few hours that I was there to study. My friend ordered Banana Bread doughnut, which is topped with toasted walnuts. He thought it was full of flavor and finished it pretty quickly. We both ordered coffee, which was pretty average, but the woman working was very helpful in providing any cream, sugar, or sweetener that they had. 

When we got our doughnuts and coffee, we sat at a table and it was a very calm environment with huge windows providing adequate light throughout the shop. It was unfortunate that the side room was closed, so we were not allowed to sit in there, for what I assume is because of COVID restrictions. This room would've been ideal because there were more options for outlets to plug in my computer charger, but the woman working saw that we were looking for outlets and pointed us to the 2 that were in the main dining area. I really appreciated her help with that. The music volume was also perfect for ""background"" noise, unlike some coffee shops that blare their music making it hard to hear myself think. 

While we were there to study on a Saturday morning, we did not partake in any of the games that lined the walls or order any of the many beers on tap, but I will definitely be back for those! Overall, great experience and highly recommend if you want to have a doughnut, coffee, beer, play board games, or even study.",2021-01-10 18:52:11,426,2073,

Upon walking in, the lobby was quite welcoming, however the two women at the front desk did not greet us. One had an excuse, as she was finishing up with someone else, her name is Shan. Shan was finishing up with another guest, my fiancé and I were tired after our flight and the other woman, older had short black hair didn't even look at us, then when the phone rang answered it instead of helping the people right in front of her. Shan then checked us in, she was very kind.

I'm in the customer service industry and you should always help the people standing in front of you first. I wish I got her name, but the woman that works evenings with the short black hair is clearly miserable and hates her job.

We had two separate reservations and my fiancé told them when we checked in to see if we can just roll it over, it wasn't a problem. We ended up having an issue with the key the night the first reservation was up, and my fiancé went downstairs to tell them, the woman with fantaaastic customer service was saying he wasn't on the reservation - which we had gone to the front desk twice before to confirm the reservation situations. Just giving him a hard time when it clearly wasn't necessary. 

Anyways, the hotel itself, seems they were in the middle of remodeling the common area on the 7th floor. Rooms are OK. They are a place to shower and sleep, if you're looking to be very comfortable, I would highly recommend going elsewhere.",2021-01-18 01:47:43,324,1547,

The first thing I did was call my Lexus Roadside Assistance by pushing the SOS button (extremely convenient). Immediately Savannah answered, her first question was do I feel safe. She confirmed my contact information & proceeded to provide amazing customer service to get my car towed. In the midst of our call, the car disconnected our call. I am sitting there thinking what direction to go!! Savannah called me back on my cell phone. Relief swept over me and I was so grateful for her not leaving me in a lurch. She was looking for an approved location to have the car towed. I said I would like the car towed to Lexus on Speedway. She said they usually tow to the nearest place. And if I wanted it towed to Speedway, I might have to pay out of pocket (which I did not have to pay anything). I gave her authorization to have it towed to Lexus on Speedway. She made 8 calls to find a towing company that was available. The timeline was 90 minutes. Savannah and I agreed to an unattended tow and a friend picked me up. Savannah called me 3 times to keep me updated on what was happening. Lexus Roadside was AMAZING!!  
So now to my experience with Lexus on Speedway. They walk into a  RX 350 
sitting in their drop off area. I called when they opened and spoke with Nico.
I explained everything that happened and he was going to get it in and find out what was going on to cause this to happen. I have an app on my phone (through my cell provider) that does a maintenance check on the car and it gave me an error code P0335 which I passed on to Nico. We talked about a loaner, since I am retired and had no obligations, I did not need a car unless this turned into a major repair. The answer to the problem was unbelievable to me...but here it is. They hooked the car up to the computer, did some kind of a super charge to the battery and said it was working!! So now I am a little untrusting of the car...because what if it acts up again and I am stuck somewhere. I am 72, retired and don't drive much (300 miles in 3 months). There in lies the problem!! I do not drive the car enough (you know the cliché, ""driven by a little old lady that only drives on Sundays""...that is me & it is true) ...I need to run the car more, you don't use it, you lose it. I had tons of questions for Nico and he could not have explained everything more clearly or patiently. He made sure I was totally comfortable and satisfied with all the information. He pulled up the car records and we went over everything!! Thanks Nico, you are the BEST!
Lexus of Speedway was even going to deliver the car back to me, but a friend and I were going to be out; so I stopped and picked it up. I go to get the car, and pull out my credit card to pay for everything...NO CHARGE!!!  WHAT, I was so very surprised, that was completely unexpected and appreciated.
I bought my car when I lived in Illinois and chose the Speedway location to take over my service/maintenance. I wanted to take the time to share my experience. I have always been pleased and satisfied with the service. But  I thought this was pretty darn good service for being completely unplanned and fitting me in because it was an emergency.
Thank you Lexus Roadside Assistance (Savannah), Miguel (from the towing company), Nico from Lexus on Speedway and Lexus! Lexus for having such a great customer service brand.

I arrived 5 minutes early, was never asked my name, just what I wanted.  Told them a deluxe pedicure and gel manicure, and was told to pick any pedicure chair. No one came by for 12 minutes and then someone came by and said Phuong was running behind and they were going to give me someone else. Another 6 minutes goes by and Tina arrives, confused not sure if she was working with me and then apologetic once she was assigned to do my feet.

After much apologizing and asking me if I was okay, Tina got to work on my feet. She did a good job but nothing exceptional. When I said I was looking for regular paint on my toes, she kept trying to give me gel. Then after I got her to understand I was regular paint, the next hurdle was getting my color. She couldn't find a simple shiny black paint. Really? She tried to give me a gray glitter that she thought was pretty. Like NO, I want a shiny black. She could find it and we settled with black. Then she came back to add a coat of shine on top. Fine. I'm over it.

Next to the manicure, I was ready to get it done by someone else, but Tina insisted that she could do a french gel nail with a V-in black. Fine I'm tired of the attempt to communicate with her added to the fact that appointments clearly mean nothing to this place. I was feeling like I was in a very tight confined spot as masses of women kept coming in and all the seats including two extra make shift pop-up tables were added to the rows of manicure stations. Mind you, there is a plastic divider between the pedicure and manicure stations but not on the two pop-up end caps. 

Tina, starts the process of removing my old gel manicure on the pedicure station. When she's done with the removal and starts the cuticle cleaning, I said, stop, I prefer to wait for a manicure station. Off she goes, and other manicurist must have told her all stations were not available for her. She comes back to try to keep doing my nails at the pedicure station. I stopped her and told her to go tell the owner, that I was not a walk in, that I had an appointment and I would continue to wait to get my nails done correctly with a manicurist who had a station. This did not please Tina, yet off she went. Comes back telling me she got one of the pop-up end tables to do my nails. Fine, I move over. 

Not pleased when the table couldn't even hold a towel and her tools. We wait some more, going into 45 minutes over the time I was scheduled to have been finished with my nails!!! We move to the manicure station next to the pop-up. When I ask, would she be sanitizing the seat and stations. Oh yes. Yet she did not, only replaced the towel at the manicure stations. This is not a sanitary place. The reviews do not align with the lack of sanitary and customer service I received. The manicure looks like I did it to myself and the fee was not reduced or anything for the poor service I received. 

BEWARE, it appears they are trying to follow sanitary protocols, but plastic dirty partitions are not the only form to ensure sanitary Covid necessary preventions. Totally disappointed with this site and I cannot understand these reviews. First time, Yelpers, I cannot agree with you. This place is about quantity not quality or repeat customers.",2021-01-02 19:58:58,731,3455,

I am a huge fan of mexican food and once I find a spot a like, I am super loyal. Well I can say after one visit here that I will be coming back. First off, super impressed with the friendliness of the staff. Everyone one we encountered was very welcoming and very polite. After being seated we snacked on the complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip. The salsa is very good and the bean dip is a perfect counter to the slightly spicy salsa. Our waiter took our drink orders and had them to us in no time at all. After a quick scan of the menu, I decided on the mole enchiladas. My wife went with the enchiladas suizas and we ordered the children's chicken taco for my daughter. Quick context, like most kids my daughter can be quite picky. Well needless to say she ate the taco so fast we had to order a second a la carte. Which she proceeded to finish as well. When we asked her to give the tacos a one to five fingers rating she gave it ten fingers and said it was the best taco she's eaten in the whole world. The whole time I witnessed my daughter mowing down tacos my food somehow disappeared. I don't know where it went, but I do know that it was super tasty. My wife was equally impressed with her food and was nice enough to give me a taste. And yes, it too was amazingly delicious.

Upon walking in the first things you see are the sushi counter that looks like it hasn't been cleaned in a long time and a stagnant fish tank that is almost black (highly doubt anything is living in it and would be quite surprised if there was). The floor, walls and hostess desk look dirty and sticky. We hesitated for a moment but decided to give it a chance because of the reviews. The service is practically non existent but personally not picky on that. The food was absolutely disgusting! Miso soup tasted off and dirty. Kani salad tasted expired even through the extremely excessive amount of spicy Mayo and tempura. At this point I was scared for the rest of the food to come out! I ordered the spicy tuna roll and the sexy girl roll. At first glance the rolls were very sloppy and falling apart. But it's all you can eat sushi so I wasn't expecting a fine dinning experience. But the taste made me want to run! The rice was old and not proper sushi rice to begin with. The fish was discolored and WARM. The taste was of spoiled fish and again this was through the excessive amount of spicy Mayo and tempura. Then came the rest of the food. Chicken fried rice tasted like dirty dish water, teriyaki chicken was a joke! An old horribly dried piece of plain chicken with some teriyaki sauce and sesame seeds thrown on top. Crab Rangoons again tasted sour and expired and like they dumped sugar in it to try and cover it up. The fried dumplings were just awful. The chicken wings were so dry they could cut the roof of your mouth and had a foul taste to them. We couldn't wait for the check to come so we could finally get out of there!

The staff brought  us a complimentary glass of bubbly to help us start the celebration off right! We decided to try the Five Course meal with wine pairing. Full disclosure here, I am not a huge connoisseur of wines and when I drink, I tend to stick to a couple tried and true but tonight I ventured out of my comfort zone and I am very pleased I did. The sommelier was very knowledgeable and explained each and every wine, and the reasons for his pairing with the dishes. I swear I was starting to taste the ""woodsy notes"" and ""hints of floral"".  I will definitely try more wine pairings in the future. Hannah, our waitress was just the right blend of friendly and funny, who remembered key parts of our conversation that told me she was always paying attention. Great quality to have as a waitress. 

NOTE: I was trying to be stealth in my note taking during the meal so I wasn't able to quite capture all the descriptive words used for each course nor can I tell you the specific names of the each wine. And please forgive me if I do not use the proper adjectives when discussing the meal . This is just written in my layman's terms. 

In lieu of taking a picture of the menu, I will describe the five courses in hopes it will pique your interest enough to go dine here yourself.

The first course was crab meat layered over the softest mildest cheese I have ever had the pleasure of eating. There was also a blend of pickled carrots, tarragon and olive oil. This was paired with a deep rose wine. There was no single distinct flavor that stood out all by itself. All the flavors blended nicely and created one delicious note. 

Second course involved long grain rice cooked risotto style and placed atop chicken terrine, with goat cheese and jalapeño powder. This was paired with a light rose Grigio wine. It was the lightest, tenderest dish I have tasted. Simply melted in my mouth. 

Third course was paired with a light rose wine that wasn't dry (yay for me). It was white fish in a light aioli sauce with tiny satsumas and purple cauliflower. Oh My! the blend of citrus and aioli was superb. The fish was light, flaky and seared to perfection. 

Fourth course was hanger steak with a collard green rattan paired with a dark red wine. Tender, flavorful with the slightest crust of herbs that wasn't overpowering. The flavor of the meat shone through.  It impressed my son, who is also a chef. He said the steak was cooked perfectly.

Next there was a palate cleansing pre dessert of a Pinot Grigio sorbet with cheese curls and a pumpernickel crumble. Very interesting combination and not at all unpleasant. I'll admit, if I saw this on the menu I would be scratching my head but definitely worth eating a second time. 

Lastly there was strawberry sorbet on whipped ricotta with a cookie crumble, pistachios and squares of lemon merengue. This was paired with a bright red Moscato wine. Perfect ending to a wonderful meal.

We had a reservation for 7:45 and got there exactly then. (We made the reservation 5 days prior for the individual covid friendly covered patio seats). The hostess said they were running behind on reservations and we would have to wait 15-20 minutes- for a reservation we made in such advance. We got seated 35 minutes later than our reservation was for, at the worst table in the joint. Mind you, it was RAINING and our table was not even slightly covered. We then asked to be seated at the place we requested on the reservation and they said it would be another half hour. After seeing a table get up and leave from the patio, I went back to the hostess and explained how we waited 30+minutes to sit in the rain- she finally moved us. The three female hostesses were not accommodating and not friendly at ALL

The server we had was Kathy- she was super enthusiastic and friendly. However, we asked multiple times for things such as menus and napkins. It was definitely busy, so we understood the waiting times.We did wait a while for drinks, too, but that isn't her fault. 

Positives-
The covid friendly patio huts are super secluded, warm, and safe. I would 100% recommend sitting here if you are going to Sampan. Ambience was great, here. 

The food came quickly and was super tasty. I ordered the shrimp pad Thai for main meal, which is categorized under the ""sides"". The bowl was so big that I could barely finish half of it! Definitely go for it for your entree and not as a side :) We also ordered the AMAZING crispy Brussels, rock shrimp (which is better at other places) and crispy duck (which comes with steamed bao buns) the drinks were really refreshing and strong. I would definitely go back to this restaurant - but wouldn't RUSH back. There are other places in Philly I would want to try before returning.",2021-01-16 17:47:02,378,1854,

We arrived on a non-busy, Saturday night, and was left waiting at the door for 5 minutes before anyone even greeted us.  After being shown to our table, we waited about 8-10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged our existence!  If this would not have been in the midst of COVID, and downtown was fully open, we would have left and gone elsewhere immediately.  

Food is extremely mediocre - - lobster dishes are very disappointing.  Husband had lobster roll which was so small, he finished it within 2 minutes ($19) and was still hungry; son has lobster Mac & Cheese ($20) which arrived cold, and lobster was scarce and very overcooked/rubbery.  It takes a lot for my son not to like a Mac & Cheese dish, but he didn't even finish it.  I had lobster grilled cheese ($19)  - - the ""rustic bread"" was grilled so long it was like biting into concrete! Very dry and cheese wasn't even still warm so it must have been sitting awhile before waitstaff delivered it....again, it was NOT a busy night, so no excuse there.

How they have the nerve to charge the prices they do, given their complete lack of customer service basics, along with mediocre food, is beyond me.  We will not be back.

Please don't waste your time or money on this restaurant - - I wish we had gotten a true Yelp review so we could have avoided this place.  There are so many OTHER choices out there, where you will find a much more customer friendly environment and delicious food.",2021-01-25 18:44:27,317,1525,

First of all, I've got to start the new year in a healthy way.. because... resolutions. 
Hard to believe this is the old Provence French Bistro in Hillsboro Village. It always seemed dark and crowded to me.  Well, that's no longer the case.  Fast forward about three years.  This space feels expansive, crisp and modern white.  They clearly had professional design help and they nailed it. I almost feel like doing yoga here.
This is a fast casual, one-of-a-kind concept. Yes, ONE-OF-A-KIND. Nashville has been getting so many chain eateries lately, the fact that this is locally conceived and owned by former Vandy grads moves it up so many notches for me.
But, I guess that's all well and good unless the food is amazing.  The good news: IT IS!  Fresh, Healthy, Fast, Delicious.  
The service is friendly and prompt.  And the employees could actually answer my questions. *Appreciated.*
I had the Shrimp Bowl and Tennessee Thai Salad.  Colorful and flavorful in the ""make ya wanna come back"" way.  Every healthy option you are looking for is available to make your own creation.  But, they have done such an excellent job with their pre set house creations that you won't go wrong.  The house made dressings are divine. I think it is also worth noting that they don't have a freezer.
They are realistic about the health conscious... You can even finish up with a buttery, chocolatey cookie...

A family member saw the culprit break into the car and gave chase. We scoured the area for 30-40 minutes after contacting the police. We later identified the guy at a Circle-k about 5-7 miles away, called the police and he was arrested
The next day I insisted on speaking with the owner re: this situation. In essence he stated, in so many words, that essentially he is not responsible for providing a safe environment for Attendees or their property, including vehicles oarked on HIS property/parking lot. I informed him that we had just spent over $9,000 for his company's services  and had also spend another $9,000 5 months prior for services for the wife of the decedent whose life we were there to give homage to. He asked, ""what do you want me to do""? I told him that he should give notification to person utilizing his derived that he is not responsible to their ""customers"" and their valuables, including their car, so that the customer can make other arrangements (ie, we could have had a family member  guard every 20-30 minutes on a rotating basis our property since he wasn't willing to)----he flatly denied that he would/could do this. I informed him that his attitude was unacceptable and that our family had lived in the Tucson area over 100 years and over this time we have always used this mortuary that we would not on the future---they may care about the dead more than they do the living. In my opinion they are more concerned about squeezing as much money out of the community (especially the Latino community that is their  primary source of referrals) than in paying some person 10-13 dollars an hour for 3-4 hours of work to provide security to us and our property.use this companies services at your own risk ---if they don't care about you what does that say about caring for your vices one who just died.

yg9BinhOoN7cvFhMGhn7AA,8rzqG5NLuDlnqE49USzvTw,wz8ZPfySQczcPgSyd33-HQ,4,4,1,3,"I will go ahead and update this review as I never reviewed this as a covid-19 and the place where I gamble the most since my wife and I usually stay here.  The pros are Grand Sierra definitely gives out great perks.  

Definitely enjoy the free rooms without resort fee and give out a lot of free play. Since I am in the purple tier which now requires 7,500 points instead of 10,000 free play ranges from 25 to 60 dollars.  Plus sometimes I get free invitations to slot tournaments and before the pandemic I used to get to attend free shows.  Sometimes they give out dining credit as well.  The rooms are really nice and never have an issues with it other than we did have some loud neighbors.  They also have a good selection of food as well, but be prepared to spend quite a bit however and can be expensive and charge $2 dollar fee for takeout.

The cons during the pandemic and it is not a GSR issue but a Covid-19 deal.  During prime time (10am to 9pm) especially during Friday through Sunday be prepared to wait in a long line to go in the elevator to go to your room.  Times can range from 15 to 30 minutes.  So before you leave your room make sure you have everything especially.  Going down can take a very long time as well especially at 11am to 2pm.

Now for the rewards experience. Bad thing is they definitely turn on the heat here when it is cold and sometimes can be unbearable when gambling especially if you are wearing a jacket come in from the outside.  Lines can also be long for the members club to get cards so having a machine to get the cards can be nice as I seen other casinos do this.  The other con  are the machines to claim your rewards. They definitely need to upgrade the system for this as you can tell the machines are really slow and very outdated as I can not remember when the last time they updated this and I been going here for the last 10 years.   Sometimes your benefits do not get updated as well and you have to go to the guest services which the line can be very long.  They did do a good job though on claiming your rewards on the machines and upgrade the infrastructure as it is really easy and fast.

Now for the gaming experience.  It is usually a hit or miss for me here, but mostly misses though.  Out of all of the casinos in Reno, I spend the most time gaming since I stay here. However, I probably need to tell myself not to play here as much as recently, I been losing pretty fast here and when I finally hit those bonuses, it is not good.   Even with the generous free play, I did not win much maybe 10 dollars out of $85 I got this weekend.  But one thing I might want to consider is playing the virtual blackjack or casino games even though the payout is not good like 5/6 Blackjack. 

Slot tournaments though I tend to have  a lot of luck as I tend to win at least something there.

Overall, I rate this as an okay casino as the perks are awesome.  But it does come with some flaws though.",2021-01-20 17:33:55,609,2948,

I planned to have me a wonderful steak dinner to ring in the new year at home...quietly and safely...and they screwed up my order so much so I had to recook it at home!!! Totally ruined my NYE plans!!

I called earlier in the day to find out how early in advance do I need to call my order in before picking it up for curbside (which is totally non existent btw)...they told me 30 min. I called my order in at 7:45pm on 12/31 for a New York Strip (MEDIUM WELL) and a loaded baked potato with the side salad.  They told me it would be ready in 30 min (so that's 8:15pm...but I was willing to give them 8:25-8:30 because I know it's busy). I got there and called to try to get it brought out curbside since they claim they have it...NOBODY answered the phone or it was busy. So I went in and retrieve my order. First the woman behind the bar (which btw...ppl were stacked on each other like it was 2018 and COVID was non-existent) kept asking me if my order was under another name!' I literally have ONE NAME. Then she claimed she found the order and gave me a check for $16 sirloin that I DID NOT ORDER!!' She clearly was not paying attention. I had to tell her 3 times this is not my order and I called it in already about 35 min ago. The manager finally came over there and gave me the ticket for the right item.

However it was now 9:00pm and I was still there waiting on a steak that should have been done at 8:15! I finally got my order and ran out of there bc it was so many ppl there and folks were walking around with no mask...it was giving me anxiety!

Anyway...I got home...pulled out my chilled wine and plated my food to dive in...#1...the steak was cold...how!!!  #2 I cut the steak and I swear it MOOED...it was NOT medium well...it was still alive!! I had to recook the steak to medium well...but by then...my baked potato wasn't piping hot anymore. NYE dinner totally ruined and it was a horrible experience! I always brag about Tuckers Soulard and how good the steaks are...so I'm really disappointed in them. I'm probably not going back for a long time...definitely not getting a steak anymore!! Smh

Dt1BIz1YzOvX2ETaj82KuQ,A9cXP_K95FRor1qxuUEu2g,cfeRMWj5GVYUia_hqRsARA,4,4,1,3,"After some consideration, I've decided to drop the rating for Sullivan from a 5-star experience to a 4-star experience. 

As I noted in my earlier review, I've lived on the Northeast side of Indy for around 12 years. For some reason, I'd never made it to Sullivan despite hearing mostly good things about it. However, this past holiday season I received a call from Anthony, a Sullivan employee, informing me that anonymous donors had donated a Christmas tree and stand, along with delivery and pick-up, and all I needed to do was come in and pick out the tree and stand. 

As someone who always struggles through the season, this was a remarkably thoughtful gift. As someone with a disability, the idea of delivery and pick-up is an extra gift. 

I received the call too late to call Anthony back, but went in the next morning to pick out a tree. Unfortunately, Anthony wasn't working and no one else seemed to know about the arrangement - I'd saved the voice mail, but they felt better waiting until Anthony's return the following day. I was unable to go in the following day, but made arrangements for the day after that. 

So, I returned to pick out the tree. Anthony wasn't there - However, Kary was present and super helpful with a ""can do"" attitude. Drew also helped. I picked out a tree and thought it was fun they had names for their trees. The one I picked was Cathy! I gave my delivery information and was informed they could deliver it on Monday (this was Friday). 

I didn't get a specific time, but I did get a call Monday and was informed I was next on the schedule. They arrived and set up the tree. Both employees wore masks and were respectful of distance. 

The tree had been cut and they gave me quick instructions on maintaining it for the season. They didn't mention when they would return to take it down. 

One other time, I'd had delivery of a tree and they'd called the week after the holiday. So, I figured that would likely be the case. 

Both times that I visited Sullivan, I was pretty amazed. I knew it was a large place, but I was in awe of the Christmas selection. They also have plants, hardware, a little Christmas Express they were using for train rides, and a small restaurant inside called Sully's Grill. Helpful employees are throughout. They seemed well staffed and certainly had a steady flow of customers. They were enforcing mask guidelines and encouraging social distancing. That said, the atmosphere was still relaxed. 

They also have artificial trees, gardening equipment, grills, items for birds, and their Yellow House that offers a variety of interior decorations. In terms of accessibility - they offer accessible parking, automatic doors (including to each section), and have nicely spaced aisles. There are a couple areas that involve steps - I could likely wheel up to the Yellow House, but it has an upstairs area I could likely not get to.

I was just really super impressed with the options, the atmosphere, and the overall customer service. They have pretty formal processes, but they're casual about them and it comes off quite relaxed. I also like that you can get customer service but you can also get space to shop.

As the Christmas season ended, I was surprised to never hear from Sullivan regarding removal of the tree. They'd clearly indicated this was part of the service offered - and I'm assuming it's part of what my donor paid for. So, I'm disappointed with the lack of follow-through by Sullivan at an agreed upon service. As a person with a disability, this means I've had to make arrangements on my own to have someone come over and dispose of the tree. Considering I also had to take two trips to pick the tree, no small challenge in a wheelchair, this leads me to drop their rating from 5 to 4 with a recommendation that they work on team communication (so that if a special arrangement is made other team members know about it) and make their processes a little more efficient. 

Overall, I still give them a thumbs up but there's definitely room to improve.",2021-01-16 13:20:28,823,4035,

I was skeptical after reading the reviews on here, so I was blunt with Autumn, the arborist. He said he is aware of the bad reviews and believes they may be from competitors in the area. He assured me that they are all flat-out untrue. He guaranteed that the price he quotes is what he will charge, and any changes will be discussed before the work is started (there were no changes). He said he can't respond to those reviews because they refuse to participate in the ""pay to play"" scheme that Yelp has set up to hide or respond to bad reveiws, and I don't blame him for it. A few of my restaurant buddies are on the same page.

They did a professional job on our large tree in the front yard. Autumn seems like a bit of a tree nerd. He pointed out a potential fungal infection that may be the result of recent landscaping. He said it is worth keeping an eye on. Two of his workers spent about 4 hours trimming our tree. They cleaned everything up and didn't do any damage to the landscaping around the tree.

If you are hesitant because of a few bad reviews, you need to understand the limitations of Yelp. Just talk to the Beavers yourself. They run a good business and when I need to get the tree trimmed next year, I'll be calling them again.",2021-01-04 19:38:24,303,1409,

While COVID is admittedly a problem for resorts, I've been more comfortable at other hotels with COVID controls than here.  For example, the elevators.  When we checked in, there were lines for the elevators.  The elevators were controlled by an employee who made sure that no more tha four people (or a large family) got on them.  That was slightly annoying, but understandable.

However, come check out day, it was a free for all. Waiting for 20-30 minutes to board an elevator just so you can leave your hotel was insane.  There were zero controls for that.  During prime check-out times, that should have dedicated two elevators for going down only.  Once ground level, the elevators would go straight to the top and work there way down again.  

The casino crowds were crazy last night.  I was not there for gambling, but social distancing was non-existant on the floor.  I saw no crowd control measures.  

Reservations were pretty much required for dining.  This became an issue since there were so many people and few breakfast options.  The hotel should have let us known about that when checking in.  

The rooms appeared clean, but the amenities were scarce.  Two paper coffee cups were all we got for two nights stay.  This made us re-use the paper cups.  Not a problem except you need to fill the water tank with a cup.  Anyone see a problem with this?  

While check-in was fast, we received zero information on the property. It would have been great if they at least had a QR code for property information.

The year of the car doesn't match the sticker on the bottom of the inside driver  door jam.  Everything is a year older than showing on the sticker

The prices are completely out of control they've actually raised them.  if you would've came six months ago the same car that's now older is more money.  If you drove their car off the lot got into an accident ask your insurance company how much they'll pay and it won't be what you just paid.  The prices here are to HIGH.  Carmax well then try to get you to buy gap insurance because they know you'll never get your money back if you got into an accident the next day so they'll try to rip you off even further with gap insurance.  You can buy gap insurance through your own insurance company for cheaper.  For the same monthly payments here you can go into a dealer and get a new car with dealer incentives for the same price as this place ... makes absolutely no sense don't buy here 

Here is the real deal not a fake great review.

Carmax has ridiculous way of doing business it's only the ignorance of the public that keeps them going.

Next problem is the prices and this nonsense gimmick no Haggle.  Sure their philosophy is we pick the price we get the absolute top dollar and you pay top retail dollar.  If you go into a department store and they tell you there's no sales would you buy the clothes probably not but here everybody seems to be willing.  And they willl even take your trade in at wholesale value and make $ 5000 on your car.

I know everybody does it but Carmax certainly seems to be charging top dollar for their cars some of their 2019 used vehicles cost more than a new 2020 on sale right now with rebates.

Next their interest rates are insane you could go to Tony in Brooklyn and get a better deal.  Whatever you do don't finance through carmax get your own financing at your local bank or go directly to the car dealers and get it there for a much lower rate typically only a couple of a percent with deals. Even if you have lousy credit you won't pay the interest rates they're charging here

I'm not saying Carmax is a bad company they do seem to be pretty accommodating but that's only because they raking you over the coals taking every dime from you so they should be kissing your butt left and right.  Which reminds me that ridiculous two hour wait they tell you about it they don't even have any free coffee make you pay for everything even for small snacks in the waiting room.  This company clearly is all about extracting every dime from you and then some.

I just can't stop laughing when anybody says no haggle price all that means is you dummy we're going to charge whatever we want you have to pay it.

It was amiss.
Due to Covid there was reduced seating and my husband and I had to sit at a high top at the bar. That's ok.
We did have delightful appetizers , crab cocktail that was served with a mayonnaise and mustard sauce that really complimented the large sweet chunks of crab. I opted for raw oysters. I can never get enough of those! They are just wonderful with the mignonette! I probably should have made a meal of them.
My husband ordered sea bass with a butter sauce--smart guy! I saw the sea scallops with soba boo and blood orange and thought it sounded sweet and delicious. 
Service was great! Ambiance was wonderful! I wasn't used to seeing the place so scarce of patrons, but we actually enjoyed the faint whispers of conversations and the absence of the clanging dishes. 
Our dinners arrived and although my plate was full and seemed amply stocked with food--the first bites were disappointing. Scallops were over-seared, cold soba noodles that had no flavor at all and three lonely supremes of blood orange that served no purpose, and some quickly sautéed spinach that dried out under a heat lamp. Mine wasn't good at all! The scallops had a bitter taste which may have been burned oil or butter, hence the over seared scallops. My husband though,  had a beautiful meal with perfectly cooked fish and a delicious side dish of truffled mashed potatoes--yep--I ate several bites of his potatoes.

Porterhouse (medium) - not on the menu but definitely worth it. I was skeptical, I thought that I needed a steak knife, and they wouldn't give me one even if I was staying there.  To our surprise they had already cut it into chunks that we are it like finger food. Definitely, didn't need a knife and I love that we were able to get our grub on (no judgements) in the comfort of out room

King crab legs - meaty and buttery definitely worth a try 

Pork belly - not what I expected,  but everyone said it was so good. Someone referred to it as chicharon. Yea no, no fat to make it seem like chicharron but the meat was crunchy.  I think it's one of those things you try once just cuz.

Braised pork ribs  - to die for, so tender,  melts in your mouth.  A must try for sure

Mac n cheese- it was meh, honestly I wouldn't get it again. For $9 pick another side

Twice baked truffle potato - highly recommend,  it was cheesy and it tasted like there were bacon bits as well. So yummy

Dessert 
Creme brulee- meh nothing spectacular about it, just plain o creme brulee

Warm butter cake - this i recommend.  Not sure what was in it, but it was all together yummy and just melts in your mouth.  The sauce on the side and the walnuts were a perfect balance. The pumpkin pie ice cream it came with was divine.

Hazelnut tart- if your a fan of dark chocolate I would recommend it, and it had hazelnuts on top. Wasn't for us.

I  gave it 3 stars because yes they had some good food but it was nothing compared to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse at Silver Legacy,  think that's why I was so disappointed. I only went here because this is the only steakhouse they had. Then the cake topper was, I asked for extra bread... they do not give you bread,  unless you ask for it ‍‍‍ mind blown.. for the amount of money I spent I have to request for bread?

I stayed on the line for 2 hours! Who's laughing now? 

* I asked about a products location, employee pointed me in the direction instead of showing! I get over there, then 3 different employees tell me they don't have it. Then I'm standing in line, and a lady manager brings it to me and says, ""I've been on vacation and a lot of people don't know where it is... Someone even asked over a walkie talkie and everyone responded no! Unprofessional as well! 

* I was checking out, this lady shoved the receipt in my chest!!!! I didn't know that if she meant to, but the way the mixed couple behind me, looked at me, maybe I should have reacted more viciously. 

Please be aware of this establishment, they will walk right over you! Everyone needs to be treated with respect! RASICM IS NEVER OKAY IN A BUSINESS!",2021-01-13 14:28:36,393,1807,

The food ----not so much. Now let me say that I know times are challenging, and I appreciate efforts and I understand there are cut backs. We ordered the charcuterie board which was plentiful and loved the variety of bites--especially the smokey, pickled green tomatoes! That was my first bite--devine!!! The cheese variety was exceptional! So I ordered the beef bourguignon and my husband, the steak au poivre. It was an interpretation of the dishes which I wished that was explained. My dish had a red wine gel-yep gel--that was cold. It said there was a foam which was absent. and braised beef shank--which I never found. One bite of the cold gel was a completely unexpected and a turn off. My meal stopped dead in its tracks.
My husband ordered the steak au poivre with duchess potatoes. If you have never had it--it's a steak with coarse black pepper ( a lot of it!) and a Cognac cream sauce and was served with duchess potatoes which  are normally creamy, buttery, whipped potatoes that are browned on the peaks. If you have had the delight, you would have been disappointed with what was presented. My hubby gave me a bite which was adorned with a bone marrow, super garlicky butter, sans cream, sans pepper, and the faintest wisp of Cognac. The Duchess Potatoes were considerably over browned, and if tapped with a fork--the sound reminded me of crisp pavlova. It simply crumbled when you attempted to fork it.
The waitress was kind and offered to replace the dish. But after I was unimpressed with Carsten's dish, I decided the wine was fantastic to be my meal. I didn't want to be disappointed again. 
I'm sure this place was wonderful and the pandemic did not help at all. But perhaps a simple review of the menu by staff would have helped tremendously. Select menu items that could have been well executed--delete the rest temporarily. Restaurants can't expect us to patronize their establishments during a partial lockdown and tolerate and pay for subpar food. We spent $200, less my meal, tipped on the full check and exceeded it. It was our first night out in many moons , and we expected at the very least, a beautiful tasty meal.

I order the same thing every time which is the the Big Bowl with Grilled Shrimp. The bowl is made with nicely seasoned rice, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, grilled green peppers, and grilled jalapeno peppers. They give you a nice amount of grilled shrimp on it too. It's delicious!  I've always received good customer service from this location. I've  always gone through the drive-thru and the staff has usually been courteous.  There is usually a 10-15 minute wait once you order your food but it's worth it because the food is made fresh and it is delicious.

Soooo, tonight,  January 13th 2021 at 8:19 p.m., I order my usual. The nice young lady with pretty green dreads takes my money and gives me my receipt.  As I'm waiting,  I notice this young guy with a army fatigue hat,  green jacket and  glasses walking up to the window.  I see him make a drink from the fountain for a customer that I assume is waiting inside the restaurant. The entire time his mask is below his chin. I see him walking towards where the kitchen is. He doesn't go into the kitchen but he talks to someone through the window where the the food comes out. He keeps walking between the kitchen window, the counter, and the drive thru window.  He is just all up and around the food and drinks with NO MASK!  The other young person with the colored dreads keeps her mask on the whole time. 

When I asked him if he could put his mask over his mouth and nose because he is around the food being prepared, he responded sarcastically ""Do I really need to put it on. I'm working up front? I'm not handling the food.""  Where is the manager and why would they allow this.  I threw my food out. I work in the health care industry and this s*** is real.

I have to say that it's about 3.5 stars for me. I wanted it to be more, but the flavors just weren't all there. The staff were very helpful and friendly. They have outdoor and indoor seating during COVID-19. Masks are required when entering and ordering. All of that deserves at least a star. 

As usual, with this type of concept I always order one of their signature bowls first before deciding to make my own bowl. I made my decision and it was the Keto Surfer bowl. This one had 1 protein (grilled steak), a base of cauliflower rice, 2 veggies (sesame ginger broccoli & roasted mushrooms), and a cilantro vinaigrette. The grilled steak and the broccoli were probably the 2 out of the 5 ingredients that had a good flavor. The sauce didn't really add anything to the dish, and the mushrooms were just mushrooms. I mean, it was kind of what I expected. The cauliflower rice was prepared well and not mushy. The steak tasted like it had been marinated in citrus. It was a good flavor, and the meat was tender but barely warm. I'm not sure if anything is actually served hot. Maybe the forbidden rice, but I'll need to order that next time to see if that's true. The bowl size was good for $10.99. Other than that, I think I'd skip the mushrooms and sauce next time. They did ask me if I wanted the sauce on the side. I probably should do that next time. The fresca drink was basically just water infused with a flavoring. I had the watermelon cucumber, and well I think I will just get bottled water next time.

There are some positives and negatives here. The good is that the online menu is very detailed and well marked. It shows the gluten and vegan friendly toppings (and there are a lot of them). There is also a ""C"" to identify items that are chilled like the sweet potato noodles, tofu, and spinach salad. As far as the flavor, I think they need to step this up a bit because I noticed on the way home that Bolay (a huge chain in South Florida) will be opening soon near Mission BBQ. There's going to be competition between the two. So please take this criticism for what it's worth. 

I will go back and make my own bowl. It will include grilled steak and broccoli. I just need to try another base and sauce next time. Oh, and did I mention that there is plenty of parking? Yes, it's in Regency Square which is a nightmare with the traffic. But, it's a good location in the middle of everything.

My daughter and grandson wanted cheeses and bacon so that is what I ordered for my second specialty. The young lady was very nice on the phone. She said the hamburger minus the burger would leave cheese and bacon. I said great. I drove to Pizza World and paid $40  (36+tip) then I rushed home to my hungry family. They each took a bite and were grossed out saying it tasted like mustard. They could not eat it and begged me to try it. I did and sure enough it did taste like mustard. My daughter asked if I would call Pizza World to see if they had made a mistake. The girl who answered listened and then passed me to Bruce. I explained my question and Bruce said he was standing by the girl who took my order and he said she told me there was mustard on the pizza. I would have never ordered a pizza with mustard and no sauce. Bruce said what do you want me to do? I said my family cannot eat it. Bruce said I am not remaking it for you. So I hung up. The pizza went into the trash after we ordered a bacon and cheese pizza, with normal pizza sauce, from Pizza Hut. Then another 20 minute wait, drive to pick up. I hate to waste money. My family had to wait so long to eat. My 8 year old grandson was so sleepy by the time his 2nd pizza arrived. So shocked and disappointed.

I have been here a few times in the past 6 months. It's your typical Mexican food place, food is decent and prices fair. Tonight I had enchilada, tamale rice and beans for 10.bucks plus a 10.75 24oz house margarita. My male server did an adequate job of taking my order and checking back that all is well. He would of gotten a 7.00 tip from me...but totally blew it at the end.

The waiter/ waitress ""scam"" of late is the
 "" Do you need change ?"" I only had 20s and hundos in my wallet. My bill was 
$ 21. And change. My waiter knew the amount of my bill...because he rang up the bill...he could easily see 2 $20's ... Then asks me.""Do you need change?"" 

Sorry, YES I do. I am not leaving you an $18.00 and change tip! It pissed me off. I was once a waiter at Leverocks Seafood House ...7 years. My supervisor would of fired me for trying to pull the ""do you need change"" trick. It makes the customer feel cheap or stupid..as if I can't do elementary math...and frankly it is just rude. The old/ new trick of "" do you need change"" seems to be under going a resurgence of late. Restaurant owners and managers need to inform their staff this is unacceptable. It is NOT good service. I would of left my waiter $7.00 but cut it to exactly 15% or $3.00 and the change. 

My waiter by asking this ? Cost the restaurant 2 stars. I left pissed off...squealing the tires of my 70k Porsche out the parking lot. 

Diners Beware...Do you need change? Reply YES! It's downright rude and unprofessional of a waiter/ waitress to ask...or assume their gratuity. Had I put a $20 plus $2.00 he would not of asked....
He knew full well the math...and attempted to trick or guilt me into an $18.00 tip. Thus ruining my dining experience and leaving a sour taste in my mouth. Now....it will be a long time...if ever...that I go back to this mexican restaurant. A loss to the owner.... Enforce the never ask the customer Do you need change....always just give the customer his/ her change and then they will decide how much of a tip they wish to leave.

Where do I even begin?

Going to Provision was a decision made on the whim yesterday. After staying home for the last few months, we decided that eating at a restaurant was almost necessary for our mental health. Someone told me about Provision after it opened, and despite their raving reviews, I somehow still hadn't tried it myself. I think in part this was because of the location -- while the Ironworks area is great, I just am not often in the area. But I will be more often now.

I called Provision around 8PM to see if we even had a chance to get a table, and the person who answered the phone was very kind, and said she would be able to get us in at around 9:15 PM. I was already feeling good about Provider based on this phone call. I cannot tell you the number of times I have called restaurants and the employee is short/unfriendly. To a certain degree, I understand, especially if the restaurant is busy; however, taking time to be kind on the phone can go a long way.

The great service only began there. Our server was fantastic. He explained everything to us in a really helpful way. Also, he was not pushy. I have been to so many expensive restaurants where the server tries to push the most expensive things on you to ""upsell"" and get a bigger tip. This did not happen here. Further, our server came at just the right times. He refilled our drinks, brought out plates, silverware, and pre-bussed our table seamlessly. We didn't see him too much and we were never left needing anything, which further enhanced the dining experience.

Okay, so what about the food? That is the part I am still saying wow about today. Even looking at the photos I am posting made my mouth water. The food is incredible and truly worth every penny. We started with the charred shrimp. I don't even know what to say except that it was perfect. For our main course, I went with the special which was essentially a surf n turf. It came with wagyu, a large bacon wrapped scallop over crab risotto, short rib, and potatoes cooked two different ways. It was honestly the best meal I have had in Indianapolis.

My partner ordered the short rib and a side of loaded tater tottlers. When she cut through the short rib, I could see how tender it was. It was cooked perfectly, and when she took a bite of the tater tottlers, her eyes literally lit up. We were both incredibly happy with our food. 

For drinks, I ordered the ""not so clear"" and my partner ordered the ""sweet surrender."" We both liked our drinks so much we ordered another. As much as I wish I had tried dessert, neither one of us good eat anything else.

Four cocktails, the charred shrimp, the surf n turf special, the short rib entrée, and a side of tater tottlers ran us $200, and I didn't feel like it was unreasonable at all. I already can't wait to go back.",2021-01-17 18:15:01,627,2919,

I tried different things to help nothing worked. I called liberty at Krewstown and spoke to a very nice lady who apologized and told me I can bring it back for exchange or return with no problem. 
I then asked to speak to manager  for him to be aware of the problem as well. When I spoke to the disrespectful passive aggressive & rude manager name KEVIN*. He was very dismissive after I told him I did all the things he was talking about to help the RSO to come out to no avail. But he literally told me he can't exchange it or return it. Now I'm flabbergasted because the the lady before said I could return or exchangr it and was aware how too thick it can be to work, now the manager is giving me a hard time and being rude.

I could see sitting under the patio in the warmer months as a great place to get some studying or work done. I just wish it wasn't so far from the freeway, but that's the way Tucson is setup.

The menu has a lot of delicious sounding options. I went with the vietnamese coffee with sea salt crème (the unsweetened version).  Overall the drink was solid, but I was looking for a stronger coffee flavor. This is subjective, so for others it might be just right. Next time I'll try with a little sweetener, so see if that pairs better with the coffee. 

As far as the teas go, I didn't try it, but my wife said it was good. Another person I was with said that the pastry was tasty, and I have to say, if I wasn't watching my carbs and sugar, their pop tart looked amazing. The staff here were also very nice.

I'm only taking a star off, because while the coffee was good, it wasn't quite as strong as I'd like, and I didn't see a lot of food options outside of sweets at this time. But outside of that, this place is the definition of quality, great interior design, awesome patio space, the cups are thick (not the flimsy cheap type) and the pastries are top notch.

The staff is amazing! We were in the big dining room and it's an absolutely beautiful room until we requested to be moved because there was one diner that was extremely loud in the room. They graciously moved us to the bar and we had a nice view of the pool area.

For appetizers, we had the Caesar salad and the crab and avocado. The second dish was excellent, cold, and very fresh. I would highly recommend this one due to the flavors. For dinner, I had the grouper with risotto and this was done nicely and nothing was dried out.  The flavors were savory and full without being heavy while respecting the lightness of this white fish. Spaghetti with shrimp and he did not get a gluten-free version. The In-house, homemade pasta was excellent according to him. The restaurant also had a gluten-free flourless chocolate cake. This was very rich and we thoroughly enjoyed it. It was basically like eating a cake made of truffle filling. 

The only thing we had that I wouldn't recommend again is the espresso martini. It was very thin which means heavy on the alcohol and light on the espresso.  This also had simple syrup in it and that made it too sweet. (Husband is a former bartender and says it's not supposed to be made with that.) The only other complaint with the drinks is the olives for the martini or not hand-stuff with blue cheese. Unfortunately, those are purchased pre-stuffed and they taste like it in texture and flavor.

I have been going here for years now and have tried many things and everything is absolutely delicious!  Most of their items you choose any meat type that is on their list to make is personalized to your taste which is a nice option most places don't offer and the list is longer then like 4 options (my personal favorite is the pork, pineapple & onions one, I get it with everything as a must have!). Also their prices are unbeatable and so affordable. Checking any of the other places you're paying a minimum of $15 and up for an entree and these guys are charging $12 and the tacos with the handmade tortillas are less then $2.50 a piece no matter what meat you choose, so you're definitely getting your money's worth. Since COVID-19 has happened I am not sure if they are offering dine-in options but everything on the menu you can order for pickup and they also offer beer, liquor and wine but again not sure if that's still an option since I am unsure of the dine-in option because their cantaritos are my favorite with Parton. It is a family owned spot with family working inside so everyone is always so friendly and inviting when you come in. The little old ladies in the kitchen are always slaying the food and preparing it so quickly, it's also a sign that you know the food is good! The chorizo is my boyfriend's all time favorite one he has ever had.

The parking lot has assigned parking spots since it is in a business building but there are still plenty of parking spots. The restaurant specializes in sushi and hibachi but sadly I was only able to experience the sushi aspect of the restaurant. The inside looks like a typical Japanese / orient style restaurant but they have at least four hibachi stations in the center of the main room. The restaurant has plenty of tables and has some semi booths incase you want a table and to rest your back comfortably. The restaurant provides a menu that has multiple pages with plenty of descriptions of what you may want to eat. They break it down and provide an entire section for just sushi.

The staff was friendly and the restaurant is a ""seat yourself"" style. Please be mindful of the staff because the hibachi section can be loud and it can be hard to grab the attention of your waitress. 

I tried three different types of sushi and their friend wanton. I tried an eel type, a crab type and their signature Ikura roll. All three were beautiful on appearance and had great flavor. You are only given chopsticks so prepare yourself for an experience if you do not know how to use them. The drinks normally arrive fast and when you order, the food comes out timely. You are given a good helping of wasabi and ginger if you decide to partake in that.

I would recommend it. It was a good experience and the food was amazing. All the employees wore masks and they stayed just far enough away from you to make you comfortable. The staff was friendly but do not give an suggestions on what to eat. There was plenty of room away from other dinners and we were there during dinner hours.

In my experience, Google knows best so I made an effort to get out to the park and since, have been visiting it frequently for 6 years.  With the little experience I've acquired throughout the years, me and my family are able to enjoy the park year-round with no inconveniences at all. 

If I could find a park that really has something for everyone, I'd say that this is the park.  Wildlife watchers, wetland lovers, flat trail walkers, eager joggers, playground heads, parents only club, dog walkers, hill rollers, epic sunset seekers, beginner bikers, skaters on wheels, bridge enthusiasts & picnic go-ers, are some of the types of people I see here all the time.  That pretty much covers everyone.

NOTES
-3.1 mile, no elevation gain, loop trail
-8 acre park
-completely exposed so in the summer, making it out at early morning and before sunset will be ideal, unless you're looking for some heat and a tan.  Sunscreen is always a good idea, esp. being at a higher elevation here in Reno where the sun is more intense.
-Enjoyable in the winter at any time of the day when the sun doesn't burn
-There are no water fountains so don't forget to bring water
-There are two play structures. One for smaller kids and one for bigger kids.  swing set- 2 baby swings, 2 big kid swings. 4 way seesaw, chimes, tic-tac-toe, climbing structures, many slides, sliding pole, balancing steps.
-This park is very popular and can get busy during weekends, after school hours and holidays.  When the weather is cold and windy, you can have the park all to yourself.
-1 picnic shelter with 4 tables, BBQ, Year-Round Restroom nearby
-Basketball court with two - 1/2 opposing courts
-Stroller 
-There are a couple of cute hills that my kids love running/rolling up and down.  During winter, when snow is abundant, it's the best place to sled down.
-There are nice open grassy areas ideal for flying a kite and playing fetch with dogs.  Though the grass is pretty stripped so when it gets wet, it can get a little muddy. 
-great for photography. beautiful views of epic sunsets, snow covered mountains, nature & wildlife
-During peak hours, parking lot can fill up. In this case, you can park along the street.
-in the summer when the plants are tall, there's a fun maze kids love to run through.
-Keep an eye out for yearly events hosted at the park, under normal circumstances of course, like 4th of July where they put on a grand display of fireworks, set up tents that hand out treats, and provide live music.  Or in winter, meet with Santa and trunk or treat during Halloween.
-The trail is perfect for bicycle family riding or those learning how to use bikes.  paths are wide.
-The trail is lined with people's backyards. 
-Poop bags available at a couple of places.
-There's a plaza down the street with Mc Donald's, Starbucks, Home Depot, Pizza, Subway, Kid's Haircut Place and a soon to be Safeway, if you're looking to get things done while in this part of town.",2021-01-07 17:37:00,646,3119,

With COVID, I wanted to get out and explore the greater Indy area more and decided to come to TPC a couple of times: once for brunch and the other for dinner. 

I'll add that they do have an ""outdoor"" patio that has been enclosed with the heavy plastic material, so while it's technically outside, I can't say that there's much airflow if you're worried about having some air flow with covid.

That said, for brunch, I first ordered their veggie quiche. Never have I ever had sweet potatoes in my quiche before, but wow, it's a must from now on. The eggs were perfectly cooked, the veggies were all balanced so well, and the pastry crust was flaky and the perfect combo. I also tried a friend's cottage cheese and it was...the best cottage cheese I've ever had in my life. 

I also came for dinner and ended up getting the salmon, walnut, fall/wintry salad. It was very tasty and reasonably priced for the amount of greens/veggies/toppings and salmon you get. 

Service was great both times and it wasn't packed that made me feel uncomfortable like I wasn't safe during covid. 

You're welcome to also explore the grounds and farm which is a great feature. They have gorgeous areas outdoors where it seems that you can visit the little shop they have inside and take it outside and enjoy at a picnic area.

Speaking of the store, it's so nice and filled with lots of local products and vendors' products. You'll find canned beverages, cheeses and lots of dairy (of course), honey, charcuterie board materials, ice creams, local art, and so so much more.

if you are not going to have managers at the store when you open at 6am then you need to have employees that are actually there to help. i came in and was done shopping at 638am. i had a basket full of groceries and LONNIE aka Mr 47 years, at the self check out refused to ring me out on the regular register. he expected me to ring out a full basket of groceries at self checkout or wait over 20 minutes until 7am when he claimed someone could ring me up. i have been to plenty kroger's across nashville antioch franklin & donelson, shopping at 6am and getting done before 645am. i have NEVER had an issue with the self checkout worker jumping on the regular register to ring me out especially when using card payment. i told him this then he proceeded to throw up that he's worked there 47 years and has never seen me at this kroger before. regardless of the fact-- this was my first and last time ever shopping at this mt juliet kroger (401 s mt juliet rd) again!!! BUT if he has worked there 47 years how are you not able to multitask??? plus the fact there was literally no one else in self checkout. he just didn't want to help me. period. for someone that has been there 47 years i would think he would have way better customer service skills than what i witnessed on the morning of wednesday january 20th. he definitely needs further training or support. again, i will never step foot in this kroger again! beautiful store but horrible experience i never want to go through again. sad.",2021-01-20 20:48:14,319,1515,

AHN moved a couple months ago from Georgetown Plaza to Marsh Road off of I-465/W. 71st Street and Intech Blvd. They've been working to drop the  AHN name to Optum and the transition is finally complete. The permanent signage is up on the front of the building. 

The building is one story with ample parking. You'll find a convenient patient drop off area that leads directly into the waiting area. The new waiting area is larger than the old location and the chairs are much more comfortable here. Wheelchair patients will find more space and easier to get around. Due to the pandemic much of the seating has been removed though. The procedure during the pandemic is a mask is required at all time. You check in at the front desk, they take your temperature, ask the standard Covid-19 questions and you're given a pager. You then return to your car and wait till the buzzer goes off. Upon return to the front desk your nurse directs you to a patient room. This eliminates the waiting room overcrowding and maintains social distancing.

The lab is still onsite and located at the end of the waiting area for tests your physician orders.

The check-out area is much larger than the old location and is on the other side of the check-in desk on your way out. You can social distance easier than at the old location with a long hall leading to check-out.

The patient rooms appear to be larger but they feel sterile and minimalistic with very little on the walls or in the rooms. 

Dr. Mark Wyant transitioned with Optum and is still my PCP. He has been my physician for 20 plus years and I highly recommend him. He is thorough, patient with me, listen wells, follows my health closely and has a terrific bed-side-manner.",2021-01-03 19:35:50,346,1779,

Our server Charles informed us all their fried items were fried in peanut oil. That means no cracklins for me.

For drinks, I'd recommend the Red Ryder and Rum the Mules. The Red Ryder was a rye based cocktail with cranberry ginger shrub, pecan, and chichory while Rum the Mules was a rum based cocktail with lemon verbena, mint, and ginger beer. While we waited for our appetizers, Charles brought us a basket of parker house rolls with butter.

For appetizers, I'd recommend their cajun-style beef, wheatberry, and tomato soup (if they have it), Shrimp Cocktail (served with spicy cocktail sauce), Shaved Hearts of Palm with Lemon Vinaigrette, Cucumbers and Herbs in Vinegar, Blue Crab Salad (tossed in meyer lemon and tarragon mayonnaise), Wood-Fired Oysters with Chili Garlic Butter, 
Grilled Short Rib - parsley, pickled mustard seeds, shallots, and crushed herbs.

For dinner, we shared an order of Louisiana Cochon with Cabbage, Cracklins and Pickled Turnips and a side order of Smothered Greens (basically peppery collard greens) and Brussels Sprout Casserole. 

In my opinion, the desserts was the best course of the night. I'd recommend the Baba Au Rhum, Pineapple Upside Down Cake, and Chocolate Chip Cookie Doberge.  The Baba Au Rhum consisted of a rum cake soaked in rum sauce, served with banana pudding and whipped cream. The Pineapple Upside Down Cake was served with coconut lime sherbet and dulce de leche. The Chocolate Chip Cookie Doberge consisted of a cake slice with layers of vanilla buttercream and chocolate chip cookies crumbs.",2021-01-08 04:53:30,324,1687,

We got our pup in late February from the humane society, she had parvo when we first brought her home and then covid hits, so there goes all scheduled training, socialization, everything. My husband and I bought books, watched videos, tried so many techniques to help my pup with basic skills as well as socialization skills. We got to the point where we were at a loss because everything we were trying was unsuccessful. She wasn't fun to be around, we were getting overly frustrated with her and she with us, we had a witching hour every night where we couldn't control behaviors - it was awful. Not to mention, Charlie was horrible around strangers and other people. 

We started our search for dog training in the Nashville area and came across Sabra. My husband booked a consultation and we were connected with Jenna just a couple days later. The consultation was via phone and she listened to our (very long) list of wants/needs for our sweet girl. From there, we moved forward with their board and train option. We had a video conference first and again, went through some of our wants/needs/struggles etc and then off our girl went for 6 nights. Jenna was very realistic from the start on what she thought she could accomplish in that timeframe and made sure she understood our top wants and needs; how to get Charlie less nervous in situations outside of the home, how to deal with her behaviors in and out of the home, what was an ideal environment for her outside of the home to make her feel comfortable and still allow for her to be successful. When Charlie came home, we were amazed! She's a smart girl, which we knew, but she came home with so many important skills and even better, Jenna was able to provide us with the necessary skills to ensure she continued to be successful. We learned the importance of positive reinforcements, high value treats, and so much more. With our package, we also received 3 training sessions where we could continue to work on the skills we learned with Jenna and any other skills we might want help on. From her training, she learned ""touch"", leave it, drop, wait and we are able to wipe her paws without teeth marks  even those these are all great, the most important thing for us was how to deal with Charlie and her behavior while on walks, in public spaces, etc. it was a definite learning curve for us both, but with lots of work and training, Charlie has become a wonderful dog and so successful with dealing with high anxiety situations. She's also been described as being social and playful while at daycare, which makes my heart so happy for her. 

Last weekend, there was a cul-de-sac birthday party with about 20 people total (kids and adults). My husband wanted to take her out to see how she'd do - I was still a little nervous, but she did amazingly! She barked a couple times at people, but it was definitely a, come pet me and see my bark. She allowed all the kids to pet her (she's always great with kids) and had the absolute best time. She also allowed a couple of adults to pet her too - huge accomplishment. She listened to commands and was so so good the whole time. I couldn't be more proud. 

I know for a fact that this would've NEVER happened had we not gotten the help from Jenna. To be honest, I'm not sure what we would've done without her help. I know we would have a totally different dog, and one that I'm not sure my husband and I would've been able to handle for the long haul. With Jenna's help, we are able to work with Charlie in a way that's positive for her and for us. We know the tools and skills to help her be successful and a joy to be around. I can't thank Jenna and Sabra enough for their dedication to helping families like ours. We love our girl so much, and it was clear that Jenna did too. Thank you, thank you, thank you - a million times over",2021-01-26 03:20:58,829,3941,

I went today to look at sofas for my small apartment. I knew going in what I was looking for, as I had done previous research online. I was met at the door by Alex, who was friendly enough, and I explained that I was more interested in looking around myself. I do not like to shop around with salesmen because I know they work on commission and can be very pushy. I was firm in my greeting with him and told him I knew what I wanted. Alex told me to tell him if I had any questions. I started walking, and Alex met me once again, this time bringing bottled water as a tactic to speak to me. I politely declined his offer for help. He returned AGAIN and continued to hover until I allowed him to show me some models. After looking at the models he had, I said ""Thank you, I would like some time alone to mull them over."" Alex left, but soon returned to my side, this time with a survey for me to take, and more information about finance plans and a protection plan that I clearly wasn't interested in, and when I mentioned that I have a dog, Alex said ""TECHNICALLY the protection plan doesn't cover pets, but I mean, you never know!"" 
He berated me about furniture I had mentioned that I already had, and continued to push about how good the company was. 
The most frustrating thing about this entire ordeal was that Alex KNEW how bothered I was by his pushy presence. He kept apologizing for bothering me before qualifying it with ""but if I could just show you one more thing...""

I have worked in sales all of my life, and I know how hard the job can be; however, I did not appreciate the confrontational, ""stalking"" nature of this salesperson. I tried to be as nice as possible, while continuing to tell him to leave me alone in as many ways that I could think of. 

This is not the first experience I have had in your store, but it will certainly be the last.
I will be taking my business to another furniture store, probably IKEA (Yes, Alex, I know: ""ouch."")",2021-01-10 21:53:26,461,2099,

I love the food, love the concept, I love the classes, and I love the people behind the potstickers! I have been to Crispy Edge numerous times, not only for restaurant service but for not one, but 2 of their potsticker classes. I haven't attended one of their online potsticker classes, but I am confident they are just as fabulous! 

The people behind the potstickers, co-owners Dave and Jesse, have such a passion for potstickers it is infectious! Every one of their potstickers I have tried are phenomenal, from the traditional pork, to their ""should be famous"" vegan lemongrass chicken, to their dessert potstickers like cherry and apple pie.  If you have not had potstickers from Crispy Edge you are missing out in a really treat! 

This concept is going to take over the nation soon and I am just glad I had an opportunity to know them when they were just a small local restaurant here in St. Louis churning out outstanding potstickers. If you can't go to the restaurant, they have partnerships with various places throughout he St. Louis area, most notably in the freezer section at your local Schnucks. Their frozen potstickers are perfect for entertaining with friends, an intimate dinner at home and for a quick snack. I love them! They plan to expand outside of Missouri in 2021, making their little pockets of deliciousness available to the masses flash frozen and easy to heat and eat! 
I am definitely one of their super fans and can't wait to see what new flavors they come up with next!

You should know, this best-biscuits-and-gravy-in-Indy statement is coming from my husband, a Midwestern boy who has grown up on b&g, has eaten many permutations of b&g, and had not found a satisfactory b&g since the kind he used to eat when he was a boy. Had not found one ... until Love Handle. According to him, everything tasted homemade, especially the gravy. He says that so many restaurants try to cut corners and use packaged gravy, but you can always tell, and it's a shame. A shame because when ""gravy"" is in the name of the dish, it needs to stand out just as much as the biscuits, not deemed an afterthought. Love Handle's biscuits and gravy are made with lots of thoughtfulness and care. And, as my husband said, whoever made the biscuits and gravy ""knows how to cook.""

I'm really glad my husband found great biscuits and gravy. This makes me happy. Me? I think I've eaten biscuits and gravy once in my life, and that was more than enough. 

Instead, I chose one of Love Handle's sandwiches: the house cured lox, sambal cream cheese and slaw. I love when restaurants do special things like cure their own meats, so I had to try this. It was excellent: the lox was tender and salty, and the bread they used for the sandwich was amazing. It was more like a roll -- a soft and chewy yet crunchy roll that was warm and fresh. I made a great choice! The sandwich was really big, and I couldn't finish all of it, but it was one of those things where you keep eating because the tastes and textures demand that you do, even though your stomach is saying to stop. (And in this case, you must ignore your stomach!)

I've learned that Love Handle's menu changes weekly. I think they update it each Monday. They don't seem to have a website, but you can find their menu and other info on their Facebook page. They seem to mostly be doing carry out, and it was easy for us to just call them, place an order over the phone, and then you can pick up your bagged food at the table by the door reserved for carry-out orders.

None of the cooks, none of the bartenders, none of the servers, no one. You would've thought there was no pandemic at all if you didn't know any better. It actually made me really nervous because I saw the cook packing my food with no mask on which means that he could've easily just been breathing covid all over my food. I honestly almost just said nevermind before I paid and walked out the restaurant. I understand that this is a bar and that some of the covid precautions such as plexiglass can be really expensive, but masks are simply a must have and they barely cost anything. I just don't understand why they can't just do that and give everyone a little more peace of mind. Some of the servers actually did have masks, they just weren't wearing them. I remember seeing one server with it around her neck like you know you have to put it over your mouth and nose for it to work right?

We made 2 separate reservations for party's of 6. From the time our parties showed up it was uncomfortable, as if we were not welcomed.

Now we're seated. They decided to split us up & seat us on two opposite ends of the restaurant. This doesn't work for me so I ask for a manager(Todd). I explained to him the situation and let him know that there was a table open directly next to our other party and can we be moved? ""Due to COVID-19 we aren't utilizing every table. So unfortunately we wouldn't be able to use that table & I know for a fact you booked two separate reservations so we weren't aware that you needed to be near another table.""

So now you're offending me because I didn't ask for the extra ""I know for a fact"". I explained to him what he was talking about was irrelevant. I go back to the other table to explain what they said to see if we were going to stay. (Mind you he arrived with me and his Mom was at the other table and I'm at one. How do you split his parents up!?) I looked over and they have sat a WHITE family in the table he just said they had blocked off due to COVID.

So while I'm talking to the other table, my mom decides to try to reason with him. She comes back to the table and our server comes up apologizing to her for how the manager spoke to her. I said ""WHAT YOU MEAN HOW HE TALKED TO HER!?"" It was explained to me that management should never speak to a guest as he(TODD) just did. I requested that be be sent over to my table. 

He arrives and I asked to repeat what he said to my mom in the same tone and demeanor to make sure that I wasn't misconstruing anything. He did and the wording just wasn't right for me, basically categorized black people(we can't be walking around mingling, taking pictures, ""we don't do that"")

At this point it's time to go. When I say I've never experienced that there. We've been so many times and this was our first encounter with him and something like this. I will never allow you to look down on me, nor my family. It was so hard for me not to ruin my kid birthday. We had to leave before things went left and the police were called.

It's my favorite spiral ham of all the places that sell them. I remember making sandwiches for days off of one of these hams. But, I never actually ordered a sandwich at the store. I was pleasantly surprised. 

First of all, the service was great. I was in and out within 5 or 10 minutes. There was no one there at the time so I'm sure it would take longer if there was a line. The menu is simple. They have ham, turkey, chicken salad, and ham salad. They have various types of sandwiches and breads to choose from as well. I got the half sandwich and half salad combo. I chose the classic ham sandwich on multigrain bread. The bread was soft and fresh. It had their famous thickly sliced spiral ham with the sugar coating along with lettuce, tomato, Duke's mayo, and their honey mustard. It was really good. The mayo and sweet mustard combination was perfect. Okay, I guess anyone could make a ham sandwich at home but this was a quality sandwich. Hey, I'm easily impressed I guess. The side salad was also very fresh and included your choice of Ken's Steakhouse dressing. It was a very healthy lunch. How did I not know that they serve lunch? Maybe because I've been to other locations that don't serve lunch. Who the heck knows?

Well, I will definitely return whenever I'm in the area for one of these freshly made sandwiches. It's not very often because I really hate that mall traffic, but I will go whenever I'm craving Honey Baked ham.

First, let me acknowledge that the staff are acknowledging social distancing and doing what they can to keep you safe (masks, social distanced seating, sanitizer pumps along the bar, clean pens etc.). I sat indoors with my partner and we weren't near the next table. I also noticed that when a 6th person came to eat, he was offered outdoor dining, so they're adhering to capacity rules. 

I ordered the special burger for the day, the Rage'in Cajun, a beef patty topped with caramelized onions, andouille sausage, a slightly spicy remoulade, and I believe cheddar cheese (I opted out because of dietary issues). You can order burgers in standard (two patties) or junior (one patty); I ordered mine in junior. The burger was FLAVORFUL, juicy, and just the right size. My only concern was there might be too much sausage (and not practical to eat), but it was sliced thin (discs)--smart! I ordered a side of plain tater tots (they don't come with) that were perfectly crisp, light, and salted...if you have tots, I'm sold! I had a side of habanero Mayo with them--YUM. My partner ordered the bacon cheese burger that comes with onion strings. He devoured it before I could get details. Whoops.

He apologized perfusily for the service I received on my first visit attempt and explained what had gone on. His level of professionalism was incredible! I felt he went above and beyond for me to agree to give Mahana Fresh another try. Customer service in my opinion is the most important aspect of any establishment. He knocked it out of the park! I gave it a shot..I created my own bowl with Cauliflower rice, Spicy Ahi Tuna, Sesame Ginger Broccoli, Honey Sriracha Brussel Sprouts and the Citrus Ginger sauce. OMG!

.....................................................................                          I was super excited to eat here because I try to eat as healthy as possible and this place looked like it was going to be a real winner! First attempt at this place and was very disappointed in the customer service. I placed an online order to pay at pick up. After waiting more than 10 minutes to be addressed at the designated pick up area, I was told that they were only taking cash at this time, their system was down. You would think that when an online, pay at pick up order comes in, the restaurant would call their customer to advise that they can only take cash. This would allow me make the decision to either stop at an ATM or cancel the order. I told the girl that I do not have cash and she went to speak with her manager. She came back and said ""I'm sorry, we are only taking cash at this time"". I was fully prepared to give my full name & contact info to RETURN and pay for my lunch. By no means was I looking for anything free here! It would have been BETTER BUSINESS for the manager to allow me to take my order being that nowhere on their website did it say that their system was down. Curious as to what was done with my order? Because I did not touch it, most likely was placed back to serve again. Plus being that this place is BRAND NEW, you want people to come back and tell others about it. I am not trying to be a Karen or a negative Nancy. I just believe in good business and this was not it. Customer service is everything in a business environment. This sucks because I do Keto and always looking for a healthy place to eat! Do better Mahana Fresh!",2021-01-07 19:33:33,542,2617,

The park covers 14 acres and has a playground, a field, a pool, a covered pavilion with picnic tables, a nice paved walking trail, and is highlighted by the ""Landmark of Peace"" a wonderful statue of MLK reaching out is hand to RFK, who is doing the same.  There is also a large stone inscribed with a quote from RFK further North from the statue and a large mural of MLK and Coretta Scott King along with a huge collage of MLK and RFK on a nearby building. It also has one of the best outdoor basketball courts that I have seen.  It looks well maintained, as was the playground. The court's floor is not cement, but some type of plastic tiles.  It is very impressive. The pool, however, seems to have fell behind a bit and it and its building is starting to look a little run down. COVID may hav played a part in that. The building has tons of graffiti on it too.

The park has a relatively small parking lot and there is free street parking available as well.

He hears us talking saying do you see the stop...when do we push the bell. There are 2 others behind us on the bus. We all just assumed he would stop by Junkees. He blew right past it. Immediately the people behind us pushed the button for us. I said to the driver "" you knew we needed to stop there"". He says Hey, you did not push the bell. I am livid and so are the people behibd us telling him he should have stopped. The next stop at Statewide lighting is 3 blocks farther down. My foot is in agony. As We are getting off the bus I say You are a n asshole and I will be talking to your supervisor"" . He says "" Go right ahead"".  I am crying as I hobble 3 blocks now to the clinic. This is the worst treatment I have EVER had by anyone in customer service. I am 54 and have been in Reno 25 years. Please someone give this Creep the boot. He should NOT be working during these trying times. He should not be representing RTC.",2021-01-29 15:49:29,467,2002,

I ordered a reuben and it was extremely greasy. I was not please at all. A neighbor stated the quality of their food had diminished. But I gave them a 2nd chance on Jan 14, 2021. I ordered pizza shop staples in the Philadelphia region - wings, a  Italian hoagie and a gyro, yes a gyro is a staple here. The wings were pre-seasoned with pepper. Why? I always order wings dry with sauce on side so they stay crispy. Worse was that I got 3 wings that looked like they had ABC. Yuck. The pepper is subjective but when paying for food it should look like food.  The hoagie wasn't bad, however, it was more of a ham hoagie and not Italian. I had to look for the salami and capicola and it wasn't the spicy capicola so that was disappointing. Otherwise, not bad, but not great. Finally, the gyro was the most disgusting item. I bit into it and it had fries on it. Not one that happened to end up there for some unbeknownst reason, but a whole lot as if it's part of the sandwich. The tzatziki was just yogurt, not even greek yogurt and it was very little of it and the lamb, if it was actually lamb, looked like it was deep fried. Oh, and I got 1 tomato, sliced in half. So disgusting. Advice from a born and raised in Philly neighbor, your menu should state whats on the food. If you want to pre-pepper wings state it, so I don't order it. Italians celebrate quality food and genoa salami and capicola should be celebrated on an italian hoagie. Finally, take the gyro off the menu. If you can't make something half decent, don't make it at all.",2021-01-15 23:47:20,367,1655,

I'd seen them advertised for a couple months on Facebook before I decided to look into where they were located. Turns out they set up camp just a couple minutes from my front door and that got my taste buds excited immediately! I'd been hearing great things about them thus far so I had to go see what the buzz was about. I was initially excited about them being the newest contender in the arena of the Quesabirria trend that has finally made its way into the Reno food scene.

I had to try the quesabirria first and foremost because I've become addicted to it. I have to say I think flavor profile wise they have the most punch in terms of the overall flavor and their tacos are packed with meat! I got a little too eager and ordered five not knowing how big they were. I think I made it through three of them and was pleasantly sated. The consommé takes these bad boys to a whole new level. I found myself a little handheld slice of heaven with these!

I've been back a handful of times and have gotten to talk to the proprietors of this fine establishment and I love their personality and genuine love for what they're doing. I've walked through almost the entirety of their menu at this point. I have to say my  favorite item is their al pastor. I've had several reno renditions of this and they're probably in the top couple for sure. 

I think my favorite actual item is their rendition of a Mexican pizza which is essentially a cheese quesadilla topped with whatever your choice of meat may be. I've got a full on birria pizza which is not for the faint of heart. You could easily feed three people with it. I also got a 1/2 birria and 1/2 al pastor which was my own personal showstopper for me!

Ive completely loved everything I've had thus far, the only thing that didn't nail it for me was the short rib tacos and that's purely because they were still bone in. The meat was flavorful but I had to do a little deconstruction to make eating it possible. 

All in all I will definitely be back many times especially since they're just down the street from me. If your looking for your new favorite taco spot look no further! Also follow them on social media to find out if they're making any extra stops in their week and you can order ahead!

P.S. if you like spice ask and see if they have their special salsa..... it's",2021-01-21 11:04:59,490,2374,

It's been such a long time since we've walked away from a restaurant feeling totally satisfied and happy with every aspect of the experience, but Alma did it. 

The wait was longer than we thought so def join the waitlist ahead of possible. But I think that's just Covid and capacity issues. Plenty of outdoor seating though! 

The service was incredible - very sweet, personable and attentive. Our waiter was incredible and Melissa, the owner, came out to check on us and chat which we appreciated. I love that the restaurant is woman owned and Melissa also told me the kitchen is all women which makes me so happy. 

My boyfriend and I couldn't decide what to eat, so we both got entrees to share and two small plates - and it was a very happy mistake, haha! The portions were HUGE and we could barely finish. Which I'm shocked by because they were SO well priced given the amount and quality. We were totally expecting traditional small plates. I was told they're still trying to right size the portions, but honestly I thought the sizes were great. 

The pastelitos de carne was AMAZING - probably my favorite dish. The pastry dough was delicious and the sauce was to die for. We also got the Arco Iris pancakes which were everything you expect out of fancy pancakes - def a winner. The huevos rancheros was different than I'm use to but delicious and flavorful! It was a little soup like - but I enjoyed it! We also got the plátano Maduro which was the most unique thing we ate there - it was huge and a delicious combo of flavors! Crispy potatoes were also delicious. Overall, every single thing we ate was absolutely incredible and full of flavor. I can't imagine you'd order anything bad here. 

Also the drinks were AMAZING. the fresh orange juice tasted exactly how fresh juice should and the PB horchata was so sweet and nice.

The first thing I noticed is that the parking is very tight. A little hard to find a spot. When we got into the lobby, we were greeted and then did not see the hostess for quite a while, so people started to congregate. 
We asked for a table outside and were seated in a very nice location on the large deck overlooking the water. Service was pretty slow as mentioned in other reviews, but it appeared as if the team was short staffed. It took quite a while to just put in a drink order. But waters were brought over right away. The dirty martinis were large and tasty which took our mind off the slower service. Our server was very polite, knowledgeable, and personable. He apologized for the delays and even gave us two martinis on the house. I felt bad for him as he seemed in the weeds, but he was patient and took his time with us, great guy!
We ordered the grilled octopus, which is delicious with the pesto puree. The caprese bruschetta, which is also great. And the chilled seafood sampler, which is interesting. I loved the Island mint salsa and the crab and cucumber salad. 
Overall, lunch was great. The service was definitely a little slow, but they were obviously short staffed and the crew held it together well. But you don't come here for an in and out experience anyway, you come to sit down, relax, and enjoy the waterfront. 
The one thing I will note is that the location is in a very busy part of the island. It will take quite a while to get both in and out due to the traffic patterns here. Just a note. Plan to take your time when visiting.",2021-01-25 21:51:58,359,1683,

You'd think that for $11k they'd make sure that their customer had a solid, correct and complete understanding of all maintenance procedures required, that they would THOROUGHLY explain EVERYTHING that needs to be done to PROPERLY set the thing up, that they would provide full disclosure, and that they would make sure that their customer was supported with access to all replacement parts, filters and chemicals going forward. Nope. They hide the ball. The delivery guys didn't set it up right, and did not leave any instructions for what needed to be done next. The sales guy did not follow up at all to see how things were going. When we got frustrated because no matter what we did the water was still cloudy and dirty, and called, they sent some kid out who knew very little, had to keep calling the mothership to get instructions and then STILL left with one of the most important pieces of equipment STILL not installed. (He also didn't have any replacement filters on his truck, though one working theory was that the OEM filters were defective. I'm sorry, but you'd think that a repair guy for a hot tub company would have a truck well stocked with the most common replacement parts, filters and devices needed for regular maintenance. He also failed to notice that an important piece of equipment that the delivery guys SHOULD have specifically told us about but didn't was never installed at the time of delivery.)  So it took a trip to Reno with a water sample to FINALLY be told that the ""mineral stick"" needed to be installed. which no one ever mentioned anywhere.  They also didn't tell us that the ""shock"" chemical needs to be added regularly, nor did anyone notice that their printed instructions say this is ""optional.""  ""Optional?"" said the repair guy? Nope. Gotta use it all the time. ""Optional?"" said the sales guy. Who said that? Don't have to use it all the time, like the repair guy said, but it's not in any way ""optional.""  So which is it guys? YOUR printout says it's optional. YOUR repair guy says it's not. YOUR sales guy doesn't seem to know which is right. 

In practical reality, I'm not sure you're likely to find anyone better, because I seriously I doubt that hot tub dealers in Reno Nevada are anywhere near the top of the BBB customer service food chain. But if you're thinking of buying a Hotspring spa from these people make sure you get a solid commitment that they will support you through the purchase and delivery process. That they follow up within a week or two of delivery to make sure that you're set up right. That you know ALL of the various maintenance routines and tools you'll need going forward, and that you know where to buy them. (These people seem to be out of stock of everything most of the time.)  Then even if you get all that, make sure you read the manufacturer's manual, THOROUGHLY because your sales people haven't read it, and seem unaware of--or just wrong about--a lot of what is in there. Then, finally make sure you identify sources for obtaining all of the replacement filters, devices, chemicals and stuff you will need going forward. The OEM stuff is stupid expensive, but some of it is proprietary and you'll be stuck with having to buy it. (Pro-tip: Filters vary widely in price, but can be found online for pretty cheap. Like $25/each instead of the manufacture's $95/each price. But the salt cartridge is OEM only and pricey.)

Room had no wash rags, 2 hand towels and 3 bath towels.  Coffee and tea were just tossed on the counter next to coffee maker.  The wall behind the nightstand was very dusty as we went to plug in our charges, which should be available on the lamp.  They still have not installed any hooks in the bathrooms but there is an over the door ad on which was on the bathroom door.  They no longer have room service but will charge you $4 to pick up your food at the cafe.  In addition to their nearly $30 resort for for which many of the amenities were not open, they add a $2 per night maid service gratuity on your bill at the end with no prior notice.  Overall not very clean in the casino, but no worse.  On the casino floor there are lots of high roller rooms and VIP rooms, but not much for the average bear.  At the cafe, my soup was served cold and without a spoon.  The greeter had so much perfume on I kept my mask on nearly the entire time.  The steakhouse was horrible but that will be its own review.  The tile they installed around the pool entrance is horribly slipper.  Finally there were used needles on the ground in the parking lot for two days that were never picked up.  The lady cleaning those exit doors was working on them for at least two hours as we loaded up to leave.  Clearly milking that job.  Casino was very tights on winnings.

My only excuse is that every single time I want to write a review, I've already devoured my entire meal and have no pictures to show, but this time I made the effort to take a photo before engorging. 

My absolute favorite thing on the menu is their chicken tacos, as simple as that sounds (for the record chicken is the only protein I eat on their menu, so I can't judge their others). The chicken is always well seasoned and flavorful, the meat is not dry.  The tacos are loaded and not shy with the amount of chicken per taco. They are served with limes, radishes and cucumbers and 2 salsas (one mild green salsa and a red smokey spicy salsa). The salsas are both perfection, incredibly flavorful and add such a nice touch to the tacos. 

Their nachos are also delicious. I used to love the nachos at Loco Pez, and don't get me wrong they're still a great option especially on happy hour. But Don Barrigas I find more flavorful, and very generous portions just like Loco Pez. There was a time that my husband and I were starving, so we both ordered an entree and nachos for an appetizer. Once the delivery arrived, we both literally laughed out loud because the nachos were huge - neither of us even got to dig in to our entrees.  My hubby also said he loves their chicken enchiladas.
Highly recommend Don Barrigas for your Mexican food cravings. Their service is always friendly too! Can't wait to go back and eat more and try more items... if I can resist their tacos.",2021-01-28 22:56:41,323,1533,

I dined here with a party of 5 on a Saturday evening and we had made a reservation about a week prior (they were booked for later dinner hours so make sure you call if you're planning in advance). 

Our waiter, Angel, was absolutely phenomenal and offered great suggestions overall. Despite being a busy night, he checked on our table regularly and did not make us feel rushed at all. We ordered a few bottles of wine and he was genuine in giving his opinions of each up front. 

Our table shared a charcuterie board with 3 cheeses and 2 meats. The pate was delicious and the accompaniments were perfect. It was a nice appetizer for 5 people to share, though these boards can get pricey easily. For my meal I had the risotto ($18) and while it was a nice sized serving, I don't think I would order it again. I could definitely taste the truffle essence, but I honestly  didn't taste many other flavors in it. Could've used salt but that's my palate and others might not agree. Everything that the table ordered looked very nice and no one had complaints. We ended the meal by trying all 3 of their desserts on the current menu. The Olive Oil Cake was my favorite. It tasted like a rainbow cookie and was awesome texture!

A few things to keep in mind if you haven't been here before - parking can be tricky if you don't valet. There's a garage a few blocks down the street that has hourly parking. Spots on the street are a 2 hour limit and I did see the parking enforcement rolling around several times. The outdoor area is a decent size, but is shared space with the restaurant next door and is right in the middle of a busy sidewalk. The indoor seating area is on the smaller side, so be prepared to wait if you don't have a reservation. This restaurant is on the pricier side and has a rather small menu - keep this in mind if you are dining with picky eaters.

You can how FRESH the pasta is. (They make it everyday!) 

The flavors of their dishes pair perfectly together. 

My boyfriend and I had the scallops and pork belly as our appetizer. 

The scallops were topped with balsamic pearls that literally burst in your mouth when your teeth break the seal. It adds an unexpected delightful flavor in your mouth as you eat the scallops. 

The pork belly was PHENOMENAL. It was not overly done. (Some places over cook the pork belly making the actual meat very chewy, but that is not the case here). It was plated with sauces that were spicy and sweet. The flavors in this dish were an asian inspired. 

For our entrees, we got the gigantica meatball and the sachetti. 

They were UTTERLY DIVINE! 
The meatball ball that was twice as big as a baseball was placed on a bed of creamy polenta smother in tomato sauce. The sauce was everything I want and expect in a dish like that. Very savory, very reminiscent of old, northern Italy. 

I had the Sachetti which were ""purses"". They were covered in a truffle cream sauce which I loved because it was a strong flavor. There were shitake mushrooms in it which were perfect and the filling was some sort of pear filling. It was the perfect balance between sweet and savory. My waistress told me to add the panchetta, so I did. 
It was definitely a good suggestion. However, I think next time I will enjoy it as prepared.

However, I did receive a special invitation to an exclusive, members-only release party at Rincon Mountain Winery's property. The remote vineyard resides amongst the countless avocado and lemon orchards on top of Rincon Mountain. The property overlooks the coastal towns of Carpinteria and Santa Barbara, with unexpected summer heat similar to that of Ojai. I had the pleasure to meet the winemaker, Edward Darren, who studied Enology at Cal Poly and his in-laws. The parents-in-laws spoiled us by tossing homemade, deliciously fresh pizzas in a mobile stone pizza oven.

My group purchased several bottles that included their Dusty Vinyl (GSM) and Ranch Rules (40% Barbera, 40% Grenache, 20% Mourvedre), while tasting a few other wines offered. If you couldn't tell already by our selection, I like big red wines! All of the wines we enjoyed immensely with plenty of body, medium tannins and acidity, and gorgeous color. Not to mention, the property has the perfect angle to take in a winter sunset like nowhere else I've seen on the Central Coast. Everyone was extremely hospitable, knowledgeable and made it a pleasure to visit. What more could I ask for?! Fabulous wine, company, food, AND views!!

Pre-Covid Rincon Mountain Winery used to host local bands and other public events at their vineyard, however, these have since been suspended. For the time being, they offer small private group tours of their small production. Almost all of their wine is sourced from California's Paso Robles/Creston wine regions, however, they soon plan to offer estate wines *fingers crossed*. I truly believe they have found a 'needle in a haystack' with the perfect terrain and microclimate to grow and produce their own Bordeaux varietals.

After my visit to the vineyard, I can't wait to check out their tasting room in Carpinteria and take a few bottles home for my collection. Cheers!",2021-01-03 16:26:33,390,2022,

Let's start by saying the the menu is a little different from Pin Wok & Bowl but there are some similarities between the two!  
I started with the Grilled Squid, and it was so dang good, especially with the hot seafood sauce they came with it! For the spicy lovers, that's the way to go! The ponzu sauce was a bit sweet for my taste, but it definitely balanced it out! Perfectly grilled to taste!  Second dish was the sushi stack , which was the Unagi Volcano Bomb and the Orange House. The presentation was beautifully done, and the portions was plentiful! The mixture of the tuna and salmon was fresh , light , and flavorful! I wanted more! I topped off everything with one of their dessert,  which was the coconut waffle with chocolate ice cream!! And OMG! That waffle was light and crunchy and add the chocolate ice cream to it brought everything together!!!

This review has been a long time in the making - I took my perfectly healthy 8 month old bunny to this office for his third or fourth nail trim. The tech took him into a room, left me in the waiting room. I could hear a HORRIBLE scream and within minutes I was being called into the room, being told my bunny's back was broken, and he seemed to be paralyzed. They said I had to leave so they could do what they could. He was okay 1 day later, but when I visited him the second day, his food hadn't been changed, there were gnats in his cage, and they gave him a water bottle when all he's ever used was a bowl. He was paralyzed and couldn't move but for some reason they kept his food and water at the front of his cage, where he could reach it. The fourth day came and his health severely declined, they sent me home with him and within one hour of being home he passed away. They didn't bill me because they recognized it was their fault,  but when I asked for his chart, they wouldn't give it to me claiming ""they weren't keeping notes since they weren't billing me"" - aka they were hiding something and covering their asses. The male dr - the father - is incredibly rude and rough handles small animals with no delicate care whatsoever.  Rule #1 of handling bunnies is to NEVER use one hand to pick them up by their back, and NEVER let their legs dangle but guess what - that is EXACTLY how he grabbed my bunny to show me my fur baby no longer felt anything in his legs. I reached out to the NJ vet board and they reviewed the case and asked the practice for the chart as well. It's been a year and I haven't heard anything so I'm taking it upon myself to inform small animal owners ... DO NOT bring your fur babies here. Is it worth their life?? And no I was not a ""one time visit"" - my bunny had at least 4 visits to this center. I regret taking him there every day. Rude, poorly managed, untrained staff. I don't know how they've been in business this long. At least the female dr was nice ... she clearly learned how to be a good vet by doing the opposite of what her father does.",2021-01-24 17:48:32,477,2151,

Somehow a family of New England types found their way down here to delight us expats with all kinds of good seafood. So Ms Brittany is our dear server, working a double and quite cheerful.

First up was alligator bites for the table.  Three of us demolished the caput crunchy crocodilian with alarming ease. Lightly breaded and tender; likely the best gator I ever ate. Squeeze O' lemon and two sauces to choose from...honey mustard and a light remoulade type sauce. I prefer the latter by a long shot.

Daughter Unit decided on crab legs with a side of slaw and sweet tater fries. Queen Bee, aka Momma Unit, opted for whole belly clam basket. She has slaw and fries on the side; I opted for a 2-item basket. That means I got half order of whole bellies and half order of calamari along with my two sides...slaw and an upgrade to onion rings (.99 to do so).

Service was a wee bit slow, or at least leisurely. We were only the second ones in here, so it's a bit hard to figure out why the kitchen is as slow as it is. At any rate, once it did...wow! Clams and calamari both tender, crisp and perfectly made. This being Hooterville, FL I was way pleasantly shocked by how good it was! 

Daughter Unit demolished those colossal crab legs too. Ate all the big mess of 'em including the knuckle meat too! She tried a whole belly clam and enjoyed it too. First time she ever had one, for that matter; poor girl!

Fries for the queen bee are standard frozen ""coated"" fries from the old Sysco truck. Glad I didn't bother with 'em; for .99  I'll eat them onion rings every time! Homemade for sure with a lovely beer batter; lastly I'll say a bit about the slaw.

I could definitely tell that it's house made. Standard Napa cabbage and carrot in there. Then I tasted raw onion too; odd and slightly off putting note but not horrible. I wouldn't be surprised if the buttermilk were made from scratch too. 

Finally, I have to give kudos to Ms Brittany. She knows her job well, knows the menu and has just enough sass to keep it interesting. All the ladies in there seemed pleasantly friendly, welcoming and polite as any good waitress should be. Brittany certainly seems like an asset to the place, and that is difficult to find in someone as young as her.

I decided that I need to kick off 2021's reviews with one for Vision Graphics. Though Covid is still very much a real and serious thing, I am really hopeful that I will be able to travel this year! While cleaning through some old stuff, I also noticed that my passport expires in a few days so decided to get that taken care of. I wasn't sure about where to get a photo taken so naturally came on to Yelp for help. Found this place and decided to give them a call. 

Due to the amended protocols businesses have taken to accommodate Covid, I thought it wise to give them a call before heading over. The man on the phone was very nice and asked me to call a few minutes before I'd get there on the day-of. When I got there, there weren't any other customers in the shop but the man was very responsibly wearing a mask. We walked over to the photo area, he stayed 6 ft away, and was very patient with me - I didn't like the first few pics but then realized it wasn't him or the camera, it was just my face haha

Anyways the pics came out nice, the shop was very clean and the man (who I assume is the owner) made friendly talk which I appreciated. $15 for the pics and the whole process took about 10 minutes.

However, I am glad I went out of my comfort zone and gave them a try. When I use to commute to my work in Alton from St. Louis, I always passed Doc's and they always seemed to have a good crowd. Now that I have moved to Godfrey to make my work commute shorter, I thought it time to give them a try. 

When I entered the main entrance, I was surprised to see that there were two separate businesses. To the left, was a dinning room and to the right a bar. Due to the current pandemic, I entered the bar and took a stool at the end of the bar. 

I immediately was greeted by the bartender (not wearing mask). I ordered a beer and she offered me a menu. WOW, I could not believe how extensive it was. To my surprise, there was no wings and that is what I was craving. When I went to order the onion rings, I mentioned I really wanted wings. The bartender, apologized and gave me a menu exclusively for wings. How cool is that, a menu just for wings. 

I am a wing junkie. I love going to a bar and just having a cold beer or two and an order of wings. I prefer my wings not to be breaded and that is how Doc's serves them up. Better yet, I get to choose how many I want (10,15, 20 or 25) and 15 different flavors. This is something that you typically do not find at a sports bar. 

My usual go to flavors for wings are Lemon Pepper or Garlic Parmesan. However, today I was thrown a curve ball. As I read down the list of flavors, the last one took my breath away. It was, Pineapple Jalapeño. If you've read my reviews, you know I love jalapeños, so I had to give these a try. They were even tagged, a House Favorite. 

The wings were good sized and meaty. They are served them up with equal portions of flats and drums. I liked the flavor, but personally would have liked more jalapeño kick to it. It was a nice touch that they gave me a empty pizza pan to stack my bones. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying the Garlic Parmesan and the Medium and the Blackened. 

Service was good, I just wish the staff were wearing mask.

I arrived about 20 minutes early and when I pulled up there two men setting in chairs outside the service entrance who asked that I leave the keys on the dash and I could go inside when the service personnel came out of the service managers office.  They came out within a couple of minutes and I went inside where one of the two people asked if they could help me.  I told him I had a appointment for a oil change and provided my name.  He looked me up and told me that the other person would help me.  The other person was now on the phone however he said that if he did not get off the phone within a minute he would check me in.  I stood there for over five minutes without the other person even acknowledging  my presence.  After about 6 minutes he stood up and said he would be with me shortly and he walked away.  When he returned he told me that he would help once he got of the phone.  I stood there for five minutes more when he finally asked how he could help.  I told him what I was there for and he told that it would take two hours for a oil change.  I asked why two hours and told him that I made the appointment  to prevent a long wait.  He told me that it takes that long because they would do a complete inspection of the car.  I told him that the car had been brought there for every oil change since it was new (2007) and it never took two hours.  He told me that he could not get to it in right now.  All the while the Service Manager is setting in his office behind a glass wall watching what is going on and he did not make any effort to find out why I was dissatisfied.  After I was told that if I did not like the two hour wait I could go to a 15 minute oil change location if I liked.  At that point I made the decision that I no longer wanted to do business with Brandon VW. I feel that for something as simple as a oil change that they should be able to make a appointment and complete the service in less than a hour and anything beyond that is a attempt to try and find something wrong with the vehicle so that they can make another dollar off of the consumer.  This is not my first bad experience with the service department but it will be my last because I refuse to return to this dealer for any kind of service or sales.,2021-01-27 18:41:38,499,2363,

Plate lunches are your choice of beef or chicken teriyaki skewers with rice, macaroni salad, shrimp tempura, and salad. There are three different sizes, Small (Grommet/young surfer), Medium (Wahine/female surfer), or Large. (Kahuna/Big Guy). Beef is slightly more expensive than chicken.

I ordered the medium size plate lunch with beef ($13), but asked if I could switch out one of the 3 beef skewers for chicken. Owner/Operator Eric Inaba was happy to accommodate my request. In fact, he threw in an extra beef skewer, which means the chicken skewer was on the house. When I returned to my office, I was surprised to see Eric had also added some Kahlúa pork to my plate.

Teriyaki isn't something I order often because I don't like ""sweet meet"" and most teriyaki sauces are too sweet for my taste. Eric's teriyaki is the best I've ever had. It wasn't just the perfectly flavored teriyaki sauce itself, which must be homemade, but the combination of the teriyaki sauce and the perfectly grilled meat. Both the beef and chicken had a nice char but were still moist and flavorful. The Kalua pork was excellent as well, as were all of the sides. The portion size was so generous that I ended up with enough leftovers for a second meal. I liked that the plate lunch included perfectly cooked shrimp tempura and a fresh salad. The customer service was excellent as well. I can't wait to return!

To find Chowobunga, like and follow their Facebook page and Instagram, as well as the free app StreetFoodFinder. Per Instagram, Chowobunga is at Central Valley Baptist Church (600 N Ten Mile) every Tuesday and Thursday from 11 AM to 2 PM, and at the Idaho Youth Ranch Thrift Store (231 N Main St.) every Wednesday and Friday from 11 AM to 2 PM. Both locations are in Meridian.

Upon a quick google search, my sister and I stumbled across this place several months ago. Both of us being avid Thai cuisine lovers, we are always interested in exploring and trying new Thai spots... that was until we found the heaven on earth that is Thai Town Cuisine. I will NEVER go anywhere else for Thai food... unless I go to Thailand itself. Who knew such an amazing Thai restaurant could even exist in the mediocre state that is Indiana. 

I have only ever gotten takeout (my sister and I prefer takeout, even pre-COVID, because we are couch potatoes and like stuffing our faces whilst binging the latest awful reality television show). That said, every meal I have ever ordered and picked up from Thai Town Cuisine has been cooked to perfection and then handed off to me with such kindness, every trip has truly been memorable. On days that I watch too much news or look through too social media and am reminded of the ugliest parts of humanity, slowly sinking into an abyss of hopelessness - I stop myself. I shut my eyes. I imagine myself picking up delicious Thai food from the kindest people who have ever walked this earth. It's in that moment that my hope is restored and I am reminded of the most life-giving things and people this world has to offer. Thai Town Cuisine has the power to cure depression and anxiety, terminal illness, mass-starvation, human division, that abnormal feeling you get from hitting your funny bone, and everything under that sun that needs  healing. Thai Town Cuisine is the answer... it is everything you have been searching for. 

If it's not already blatantly obvious, I can't recommend this place enough. Jokes aside, this place and the people who run it are outstanding. These are the kindest food service people I have ever met and the yummiest Thai food I have ever eaten. Not to mention, they have pretty stellar pricing for the quantity of food they give you. Go to this extraordinary establishment and treat yourself to some spectacular customer service, delightful pad Thai, and the best Thai tea you will ever sip on. You won't regret it.",2021-01-21 23:09:28,429,2198,

Creamy veal and spinach filling, lots of Alfredo baked in with a touch of mozzarella, fresh grated parm, fresh cracked pepper. My girl had the lamb which is ok but the lamb was very under seasoned but the Brabant potatoes and green beans were soooooo delicious. Amazing actually. Green beans cooked perfectly. Our server was excellent, attentive, quick with a joke, gave good advice and recommendations. We got the crispy duck roll for appetizer. First one came out Cold but they quickly scooped it up and brought me one that was blazing hot within minutes. Service was excellent, silverware polished, glasses clean, men's bathroom was spotless. The manager was nice but I asked for advice on a good steak house in town to which he replied something short and brief with no real response which I thought odd as it wasn't slammed busy and I just wanted his thoughts. I'm coming back for all the dishes. Despite the appetizer being cold which was replaced right away, despite the manager maybe not being interested in my question; I will return. Again and again and again for the cannelloni and service. The only reason I did not give them 5 stars was due to some sanitation concerns I had. Several of the table tenders/back waiters were touching the tops of the glasses of coke as they brought them to guests. Same with other drinks passing me. My drinks however were handled with care. Also, I viewed many cooks coming in and out of the kitchen without hair nets or hats. Several of the cooks aprons were heavily soiled. As a long time executive chef when I see this from an employee I see think they aren't washing their hands and it's a big food safety and sanitation. At least for me. I now run one of the busiest snd best butcher shops in the city and I'm just saying that if my guys got blood and food on their aprons I'm making them change them, wash their hands but lastly they all gotta have a hat and hair net. Outside of some small things; well done Vincent's. I'll be back for more.",2021-01-26 00:02:25,432,2101,

The problem then? His wife. If you scroll through the bad reviews, at least one other person mentions her, and not in a flattering light.

First, let me say, I've had TWO windshield replaced here. Both times, it was the owner who helped me. Also a young, curly-haired office worker. Wife was not there. First it was my suv. Everything went as planned and I was a happy customer. The next month, our sedan. This is when things turn questionable. After the windshield replacement, I'm driving and sensing something peculiar about the glass. I realize the bottom 1/2- 3/4"" of the glass across the dashboard has a warping effect. It's not enough to complain about, but annoying enough that I prefer not driving the car when possible (my husband is tall and doesn't notice it as much). I rack this up to ""you get what you pay for.""

Sometime shortly after, I'm driving the suv and the rain sensor falls off. I swing by Broad Glass to have them reattach it. Boom, there's the wife. Granted, she's never seen me before -- but the long, curly-haired assistant behind her has seen me twice! My jaw drops when the wife becomes quickly agitated that I don't have my original paperwork. She literally ignores me and paces around the back pretending to be busy. The assistant is dead silent and ignoring me, too. How crazy is that? I'm literally like ""Yoo-hoo"" I'm still standing here...?? Owner's wife returns, ""We'll do it for $20."" Oh. My. God. Are you really serious?

I leave on principle and contemplate my options...well I could probably buy the glue at Auto Zone...when my husband suggests to just try and see if SAFELITE will do it. If Safelite charges $20, totally understandable -- why should they help me when it's not their problem? Safelite people NO QUESTIONS ASKED did it for free. It's so easy and professional at Safelite. Literally 5 minutes in and out. No hassles! 

Lastly, I don't know for sure, but since Safelite centers are franchises, the owner could very well be local. 

***Edit in response to owner:
Thank you for your kind reply. It hadn't occurred to me that the receipts might be under my husband's business name, which both registrations (at that time) would have been . I don't recall whether I was asked this by your wife. It's unfortunate that I was met with such suspicion over a relatively minor thing, and that the experience was bad enough to undo the good of the past two encounters with you and the young female clerk (tallish, curly long hair). I'll leave it at that. I should amend 2 stars to 3. since I've not had any trouble with the work performed (outside of the rain sensor), and you were most pleasant and professional, and obviously work very hard to maintain your business. Lastly, I appreciate your taking the time to reply.",2021-01-09 15:31:25,645,2937,

I believe there were 2 servers working the floor sharing tables but the one who kept checking up on us, Cindy, is incredible. When she served us our popcorn chicken she asked us would we like a sauce she makes to accompany with, which was BOMB. She also asked if we'd like to go cups as we were getting prepared to leave. Just all around nice I can't possibly stop saying great things about her. After we've received our check and tipped a very decent amount because we know she deserved it, we both felt the need to tip her more! I hope when you experience this nice little dim sum place, you get Cindy. I specifically ask her for her name to put her in this review. I don't write them as much, but I truly felt I should just for her.

As for the food, I thoroughly enjoyed the crabmeat and crawfish bao. I think it used to have just crawfish by itself before but it tastes even better now. I came here because I was craving basil popcorn chicken and I think Dian Xin is the only place in Nola that has it. The fried basil is amazing!!!! For the fried short ribs, it was evenly cook and just as bomb as everything I've named so far. I've never had it fried before either. As much as I'd love to give this place 5 stars, my partner and I both felt that the salted fish chicken fried rice lacked the salty fish we were looking for, however, that's honestly my only critical opinion about this place. 

I felt the host (maybe manager or owner?)  was organized and extremely nice. We had to wait 20 minutes but she asked for my name and number to hold my spot. I was sent a link through Yelp to tell me what's my place in line and also the estimated time I should come back for when my table is ready.

I plugged the address into the nav because I'd never been there.  I'd never even ordered from there.  I was disappointed when I realized it was in the mall.  I have been avoiding crowds and I never would've made the order of I knew this in advance.  It was too late though.  

When I arrived, I gave the two staff members in the front my full name.  There was a bag to their right sitting there.   They confirmed that I ordered from the particular delivery service.  Then one of them insisted on seeing some confirmation on my phone.   This was unnecessary.  What if I didn't have my phone with me?What if I sent my daughter to pick it up for us while I waited in the car?  And why prolong this interaction when it was very apparent that the order was mine?  I think I know why they insisted, but you can't exactly get inside someone's head. 

I opened the app but did not immediately see anything similar to what the staff member asked for.  I then just opened up a text message I'd received and showed it to her.  I was then given my food.  

The interaction with the staff was a dealbreaker for me.  I'll never patronize them again. 

As for the food, it was okay.   The portion size was small, particularly for Italian food.  The preparation and presentation could've been better also.  And it was slightly bland. 

With the discount, it represented a decent value, I guess.  But not a great value.  

This was a lesson learned for me.",2021-01-24 21:13:36,340,1634,

I got the Jueban sandwhich platter with Russian sauerkraut as my side and my wife got The Real Cuban sandwhich platter with Greek potato salad as her side. We also tried their empananda (the Cubanada).

Oh vey! - my Jueban was really bad. What seems like a good idea with a cute play-on-words, was executed horribly. The grilled pastrami was beyond dry, chewy and sinewy. And they really skimped on the pastrami too; which now looking back on how lacking of flavor it had was probably a good thing. Also the Russian dressing  was severely lacking on the sandwich and tasted bland. Same too with the Russian saurkraut - more on that later as my side dish. The Cuban bread itself seemed not fresh and was not toasted. This sandwich was very dry, not fresh, tasted awful and was a grande problemo.

My wife's Real Cuban was ehhh - decent. Definitely not the best Cuban in the area not even in the Ybor area. And if you have to have a dipping sauce for it, that tells you what your're dealing with here - dry and lacking taste and/or don't know how to press it correctly and use the correct and right amount of condiments / fixins.  

The Cubanada empanda was pretty lame and not good. $4 for that - big fail.

My side of Russian sauerkraut was a complete joke. It's basically regular sauerkraut out of the can and The Stone Soup Company just sprinkles caraway seeds on it. It should not be served or eaten as a side item.

My wife's side of the Greek potato was actually pretty good and different. Had a little too much garlic but overall it was tasty. Never had a version like SSC makes theirs.

Stone Soup was also missing a few of their items that they have listed on their menu. No Mac and Cheese, no kimchi.

For the high prices and sub-par food quality I give The Stone Soup Company 2.5 stars.",2021-01-04 16:16:06,404,1959,

I've really struggled to write this review. I am very much a support-local type of person, and while I don't think I should leave only good reviews, I do want to make sure I'm not necessarily the squeaky wheel on one bad experience for a great business. This is not the case here. I've traveled a lot, so I'm not usually expecting much when it comes to hotels, but this place really has a LOT of work to do from atmosphere to service. I won't give 1 star because the bill was correct, we felt safe, and the security guard was awesome. 2 stars seemed adequate. 

I would compare this place to a hostel. I've stayed at hostels so I'm not being disrespectful, that's just the feel I get from it - rooms without windows, rude staff, people coming in and out and staying for one night on their road trips. That would all be fine IF the hotel wasn't so overpriced, and IF the rooms were clean, which they aren't. They're not even up to code standards from what I saw - and I don't mean old building, I mean incorrectly constructed or crumbling areas of the building like flooring and windows. The bathrooms are so disgusting I don't think they can ever truly be cleaned, and there is no sound barrier ANYWHERE - we heard every person, car, conversation, etc. from the back alley to the hallway. Forget getting a good night sleep, or even a good nap in the middle of the day.

The nicest person in the whole place was the security guard. He gets 5 stars. Went above and beyond constantly: holding the door, making recommendations on lunch and dinner, offering advice, and even delivering us towels (see below). 

The front desk staff was obnoxious, and not very New Orleans hospitality type of people. It's like, they want you to be thankful you've been invited to stay at their pretend-swanky hotel instead of being thankful they have paying customers. You're barely greeted, and if you have an issue they either don't know how to help or don't want to help. We were missing towels in the room, called and no one answered; went down to the front desk and didn't really get a good response (they had no clue who was there to bring up towels!), soooo the SECURITY GUARD overheard the conversation and decided to deliver us towels because they couldn't get anyone else to do it. Thankfully we didn't have too many issues after that, but we witnessed others arguing with the front desk on multiple occasions (room issue at check in, a room not cleaned, overcharges on a checkout) - which is the last thing I'd like to see when I'm walking in and out of a hotel on vacation. It's just not relaxing and creates a negative vibe overall. After seeing others deal with the same nonsense I made sure not to request anything from the front desk again, and didn't touch anything in the room to make sure we weren't charged.

On a final weird note: the food, water, vodka in the rooms is the most overpriced yet cheapest way to get money from people that I've ever seen. They just put a tray out with stuff on it, and don't tell you it's not free - and the prices are outrageous for ""local"" things like a bag of chips that you can get at every corner store in New Orleans.",2021-01-06 16:30:40,713,3306,

I'm always on the lookout for a new taco place. Tacos El Borracho looked promising as previous Yelpers indicated that they have lamb barbacoa tacos. 

I ordered a barbacoa taco, a lengua taco, and a carnitas taco. I also ordered a small horchata. The food was ready within 8 minutes, which was very fast for a food truck. They take cash, but they also take credit card now.

Alas, the barbacoa was definitely beef (my takeout container was marked ""res""). It was pretty good, but (and I can't believe I'm saying this) there was too much meat. The ratio was off, and with so much meat, there were bites that didn't have enough cilantro or onion or salsa. The lengua was pretty good (maybe a little underseasoned), but lengua almost always is good. The carnitas was fine, but again, I feel that there was too much meat.

Tacos are served on store-bought tortillas. They are pretty good tortillas (they don't need to double tortilla here), but they still aren't homemade. For $3 a taco, that's not very impressive. Tacos come with lime, cilantro and onion as default, and they have the typical red and green salsitas. I liked the red more than the green, which is usual for me, but in this case, the green was too watery and bland.

The horchata was pretty generic. Maybe it came from a mix?

All in all, this is not a destination taco place for me. It's still better than 90% of the taco places in Tampa, but I think there are much better places to get a taco, often for less money and with homemade tortillas.",2021-01-21 17:38:12,347,1565,

Wings were charred just right and we're still juicy and delicious. We also really enjoyed the queso fries-we got our order to go and the queso came in small to go containers on the side so the fries were still crispy when we got home.

The first time I stayed at another military installation near Bell chase was compared to this hotel it is a five-star and it truly is a five-star to me. After checking into this hotel. I was given room And I was taken back by what I've seen the shower enamel or whatever the coating it was peeling upon the tub gross. They had of lack of basic recommend hotel supplies such as toilet paper tissue box. I went back to the young lady at the desk they accommodated me with another room and apologized. but the second room I went in once again this was unhappy. the telephone has a residue of some sort of goo rested on it. The air conditioning had what appears that some food fell on the vent from the previous guess. it wasn't cleaned off I have to go buy Clorox wipes and wipe down the entire area that I knew I was gonna be resting my items on. The plumbing in the showers did not drain properly so I had to cut the water off during my shower so I don't have to stand in dirty water as I clean myself. It just was a bad situation I am very unhappy. I can only guess that no one is walking behind and checking the cleaning staff's work. I never thought that I would have to continue to use my shower shoes in a hotel shower in my room. that's bad I'm not deployed and I'm not at war so why I'm using my shower shoes to take a shower. I hope that the management of this establishment step up and get more involved with the workers and caretakers of this property. without any SOP's or checks and balances customers will always get below standard quality living conditions and with this pandemic is going on you want to feel comfortable in a hotel room and know that it is cleaned.

When i wrote my original review on google they had just filled two of my teeth.  fast track to about a year later, they had to fill the same teeth again!  i don't keep such close track of my dental records - that's some thing i would NORMALLY rely on my dentist to do.  But when the claim was denied by my insurance because they require any work done to last at least 24 months and anything re-done in less than that time should be on the dentist who's work has FAILED.  I talked to my insurance and they explained all of this to me.

I then spent, I'm not kidding, almost 5 months going back and forth with the office - leaving voicemails, talking to the occasional live body when they made the mistake of actually answering the phone and then NOT getting a call back.  Finally today someone answered and I went over all of this again with whomever I was speaking to.  She started going down the path of ""oh well, since insurance won't pay, it's up to the patient!""  I communicated my stance being that why am I responsible for shoddy work that barely held up for a year and had to be re-done?  She started getting frustrated, I was getting frustrated because she kept talking over me and then she HUNG UP ON ME!

I called back.  After leaving one voicemail and calling back three more times, someone else picked up and AGAIN I HAD TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING THAT WAS GOING ON.  And again, I could see the brick wall I was going to be ramming my head into once more.  I stated my ultimatum - do you want to lose a client of 23 years or do you want me to pay a bill for lousy work that lasted barely a year?  She said she would need to talk to Dr. whatshisface (new guy who took over the practice a year ago after Dr. Hill retired) and put me on hold.  Came back a  few minutes later and said Dr. whateverthehellhisnameis that I have to pay.  Just like that they're willing to flush a 23 year relationship down the drain.  If this is the level of service that the rest of YOU can expect - cuz I'm definitely moving on - I don't anticipate them being in business for very long.

I've only had a celiac diagnosis for a few years so I fondly and at times, longingly, remember the delicious taste of wheat. GF baking is not for the faint of heart. It is finicky, particular and at times, feels near impossible. 

I had the quiche today and it was fantastic. Broccoli, bacon and cheese all layered on a delicious crust that was reminiscent of its gluten filled counterpart. 

The Apple fritters are really good and one of our favorites. The churros are a generous size and delicious. 

We tried the sugar cookies at Christmas and I was thrilled- they were very good. 

The main challenge I've found with GF stuff is that it's either dry/dense like a hockey puck, or gritty/sandy from too much rice flour. You won't find any of that here. I'm always hesitant to try new GF places. It feels like in many instances you have to trade safe food for flavor. You're so happy to find a place where you can safely eat, that you're willing to let things slide like taste, texture and flavor. Again, definitely not the case at Zeal. Not only can celiacs safely enjoy the food here, it's delicious food. 

I'm so thankful to have a delicious east side GF option. My kids are thrilled to have a safe new place for treats. I'm really grateful to have a new place that tastes like the treats I remember.",2021-01-23 17:54:18,302,1429,

1. I am allergic to pork and I cannot find a meatball actual ingredients list anywhere for you guys (Yes there is a health guide thing but it has no basic ingredients)  I have tried writing corp for one but they are slower at responding than my wish for a meatball. I love the meatball and I risked it today because of this lol. I will either try to peel my skin off in an hour or not  :(

2: If I order online: And I think the guy had real intent to serve me better by waiting till I am in the building to throw it together to not get soggy...I know it will be that way and I order online to save time...Just a point of note. The sandwich will be fine soggy :) I was in a hurry and was there an extra 10 minutes which made me miss an appointment. It is a small thing but if we do not communicate then we see things from different angles. I still thank you for considering the soggy though.

Now that being said...The customer service intent was on point and if this is the worst of it...I will soon know if the meatballs have pork in them and the staff wants to please and for that I am pleased. 

The owner and coporate actually care and try to keep a staff that does as well. That keeps me coming back as you all handle my food. I would like to thank you for this as I've had run ins with Jack in the Box and Burger King...I try not to eat their food anyway (because nobody cares). When I reach out, I like to know I am heard (Not because I need power in my life...I have plenty...But because I want good food and a resonable trade experience. And with you I get that. With them I got the finger pretty much and ignored. The reason you get my $ and they do not. In fact I am writing this more as a letter because I know you actually review these and make small changes. I will also try to keep giving high scores for a job well done and nudge those stars as you guys are worth it and have my loyalty.

I received what I thought was fair for the car and was shown the car I was interested in purchasing by the salesman. He was super personable and helpful and I decided to move forward with the deal there on the spot. However, that was the end of my good experience. Upon moving into financing, my husband and I felt pressured to purchase further warranties and service packages. We expressed our wants and the employee only hounded us about other choices that would cost us more initially, stressing our potential savings. I understand he's a salesman, but we almost had to raise our voice for him to drop the other options and move forward with our desires. From there, everything went downhill. The salesman left the dealership during financials so when we went out to transfer any last personal items from car to car, he was no where to be found. He had apparently left for the gas station. I felt rushed since the other employee had his briefcase as we walked out. I was told the safety inspection paperwork would be emailed the next day. After multiple days and many phone calls, they finally emailed it but it was a scan that was not legible. My husband a few days later was called in to sign paperwork that wasn't signed upon purchase. He received a printed inspection that was legible for dmv submission. However, there was discrepancy between the title app and the paperwork on sale price, so another document had to be made up and faxed to the dmv. Delay after delay and mistake after mistake made by the dealership. I was very frustrated and unhappy with the overall service. I wouldn't suggest this dealership at all to anyone I know.

I really dig the vibes and nostalgia that in envoked by all of the wonderful items that are placed throughout the place, with my favorite of course being the cute, small piano that is at the entrance.

One of the best things about The Vintage being a prime chill out coffee spot & great alternative to other coffee shops is that they offer FREE WI-FI!!! Come one, come all and plans to spend endless hours on your devices while you indulge in their various food and drink options.

Social distancing is enforced and they require patrons to wear masks upon entrance. It is great that they have various seating options such as an small outdoor patio in the back and also tables to sit outside on the sidewalk in the front so you can take in the whole vibe of Magazine St as you never know what to expect. In my case while there, 3 large horses with riders galloping down the sidewalk which was an absolute sight to see.

I ordered the Fancy Flight which comes with 3 fabulous beignets. You can actually mix & match your selection. I opted for the King Cake, Matcha, & Raspberry beignets. I loved them all but I am currently obsessed with the King Cake version due to the glaze on top. Also I ordered a batch of beignet small bites which were tasty with plenty of sugar. I do feel that they should be offered with some type of sweet sauce or something as I feel it would push them to the next level of taste because  if you don't eat them quickly while fresh & hot you will not have the same experience as when they are 1st delivered to you. 

Whether you are looking for a cute date spot or quick bite to eat while you are out and about, I highly suggest this establishment.

Before I opened the door I see a white employee ready at the cashier post seeming as I'm intruding and overall doesn't seem like I should be given services. So with masks on and all I respectfully ask him to repeat some things he was saying so I understood being as the volume in the shop was higher than what it should really be. I'm looking at the menu to see what I was and I peeped in the corner of my eye this white cashier (he stated he was new) pacing, rolling his eyes overall appeared to be annoyed I was there. Even when asked a question he rudely responded to me. I decided to still place an order in spite of this attitude I was receiving when I probably should've left. However, after I placed the order I brought up a birthday coupon and he got a manager in which the manager rudely and aggressively and carelessly disregarded my question. So I looked around me and realized that I was the only black man in the store with these white employees being rude to me for no reason. I told them to cancel my order and I left because they have just disrespected me to a point I was not about to complete my order or return back to this store.

We checked in yesterday,  the place was packed with people, which is whatever. We get to the room, I had to go pee and there was no toilet paper!!! No offense but WTH? I get there's a pandemic but it's inexcusable. Luckily,  housekeeping was in the hallway and they were cleaning that I asked for toilet paper.

I didn't realize until at night,  that we didn't have face towels, by then I was over it. That's when I saw that a room next to us had asked for tp too. Shaking my head. 

Considering everything going on,  the place was packed. So packed, that to get to your room, you have to stand in a line for the elevator because they are only allowing 4 people per elevator. I appreciate the social distancing but the line was past Starbucks.  I feel maybe they overbooked?

In any case,  we stayed here because my aunt said the place is so clean blah blah blah. We played slots this morning and there were ashes all over 2 machines.  The lady cleaning,  didn't bother wiping it down. She just keep sweeping around us. I guess good thing they have hand sanitiers around?

I guess,  I always thought of this being a newer hotel,  it has new machines,  but I feel like with everything going on they're slacking off a bit? I appreciate the dividers set up,  just not as clean as they advertise to be. I never thought I'd say this but I think I like staying at Silver Legacy better.

Sadly,  I'm updating my review to a 1. I am playing slots right now, the game glitched. I knew that was a bad sign, I pressed the button to cash out and the game froze. It says call attendant, there is no one to be found. I spot someone in a suit, he tells me we will get to you when we can. Apparently,  a whole bunch of slot machines froze. All the people in suits are just walking around with papers not doing anything.  It looks like only one person is cashing people out and clearing the machines.  A little old lady that looks like she can be my auntie. It has been over an hour now.  I still haven't been helped.  Definitely,  the worst stay here ever.

I'm updating review, today is January 17th 2021. I'm not sure why but I use to think of this place that was modern and classy. This afternoon while in our rooms, on the intercom someone says the incident has been resolved. I was half awake and all I can think is what incident? What kind of incident? Is it safe to leave your room? 
Why was it last night at all the entrances, there was security guards with metal detectors you have to walk through? There was no event going on.  I hate to say if but I feel it's become ghetto.

I wanted to purchase my fiancé a 3 wheel 7 speed bike. We have an extremely steep driveway and she would need the 7 speeds when carrying stuff in the basket.  i dealt with Adam. Nice guy but not a man of his word. 

IN SHORT:
1.  My first bike ordered was entered as a completed purchase.  I checked in with Adam to see what was taking so long and he said he thought I had picked it up.  This was the exact bike she wanted.  When I showed up to reorder he said the bike was no longer available. 

2.  We went back and picked out a second similar bike but now it was no longer a surprise for her birthday. He pushed the bike he tried to originally sell to me. It was Gold 7 speed not mint green like the original order.  

3.  When the bike came in 3 weeks later. It was a one speed.  It's now been almost 8 weeks since my original order.   Adam told me he was going to order a seven speed kit and contact me when it's in. I can bring the bike back and they will install it. I DID PAY FOR A SEVEN SPEED.

4.  I left for my bone marrow transplant on August  13, 2020.  Spent 45 days in the hospital and four months away from home.   I returned home on January 2021 and I still have a one speed bike. 

NO FOLLOWUP AT ALL by ADAM

I'll be working with another bicycle shop soon to correct Adam's mistake once I can get my immune system back.   He lost a great customer.

Kennedy make a campaign speech but instead were informed that Martin Luther King had been assassinated. 

Kennedy's speech has long been acclaimed and credited as a key factor as to why Indy remained peaceful in the hours and days after King's assassination while other large cities nationwide experienced riots. 

The park is home to the Landmark for Peace Memorial, a tribute to both King and Kennedy that was funded by the Indiana Pacers Foundation with a design concept by Indianapolis writer Greg R. Perry and sculpting cast by Indianapolis sculptor Daniel Edwards. The memorial is in my estimation one of Indy's finest examples of both memorial and public art, a meaningful gathering space in a 14-acre park that also, as it did for me this morning, serves as a place for reflection and gratitude. 

There is such tremendous power in walking, or in my case wheeling, between these figures of Kennedy and King outstretched toward one another sitting on nearly the exact spot where their lives became so irrevocably intertwined in Indiana history. 

This park is part of Indy Parks. The park itself does also have a pool, though it has been closed during 2020 due to the pandemic. I think the weaving together of practical and aspirational help to make this such an extraordinary park and one of the true gems of Indy Parks. 

There are, of course, other places you can visit in Indy in observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, including my own alma mater Martin University (which was actually named after both King and St. Martin de Porres). 

However, a visit to this park and the Landmark for Peace Memorial is essential and I'm glad I was able to start my day here.",2021-01-18 15:03:20,351,1859,

I found this place and it looked like it was worth a try. We arrived around 2:00pm on a Sunday and it was super busy and with the restrictions I knew I would have to wait a little bit. I was told it was a 45 minute wait and I figured I had nothing else to do so I waited out in my car. But by the time I got seated with my boyfriend it was almost a 90 minute wait which was kinda crazy but again it's Sunday prime time so I was just happy to have been seated. The interior is very bright and airy in a newly built building and decorated tastefully. We then start looking at the menu and realize it's going to be really hard to choose just one thing. So we first decided on our drink orders which was a campfire latte and peanut butter hot chocolate, both were delicious. Then we decided to split the entree of O.M.G. French Toast as an appetizer and we destroyed it in less then 5 minutes because it was so good. Then my boyfriend got the Low Country Shrimp Hash bowl and I got the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict. My boyfriend loved his dish and said the flavors were awesome and he could eat the chorizo gravy everyday. My eggs Benedict was such a weird combination with the pickled onions but together it was amazing. Both of our dishes did come out kind of cold which was a little off putting but we were so hungry at that point we didn't care and the food still tasted great. Our waitress was very attentive and personable and didn't miss anything.

This niche little bakery/beer haven caters to those looking to try unique donut flavors. We stopped by early on a Saturday morning and they had 13 different options, most of which I would never expect in donut form -- pumpkin spice latte, cinnamon chai, harvest peach and banana bread just to name a few. Of course, they also had the typical favorites including glazed, chocolate frosting with sprinkles and cinnamon sugar. 

Being that it was early in the morning, we opted for coffee over beer. But, they did have 30+ draft choices available. The coffee was from Indie Coffee Roasters and did not disappoint. 

I ordered a banana bread donut and my girlfriend got the cookies and cream. Both were full of flavor, and very rich. Good thing calories don't count on the weekend right?!

They have plenty of tables, and the inside is so spacious that all of the tables were at least 6 feet apart. They offer a large variety of board games that you can sign out, however due to COVID, they only allow the games to be signed out if you rented a room ahead of time. So, you may be better off bringing your own. In addition, they had some light music playing throughout, set to a John Mayer radio station that was setting some good vibes. 

Overall, this is a great place to enjoy a donut, coffee or beer and get some light work, studying or reading done. It would also be a good place to hangout and play a card or board game with some friends.

It was a little awkward doing the take-out order for a few reasons.  You had to walk up a ramp to place your order, and the ramp is long enough for 2 people/parties to stand on it at the same time, but it's not wide enough to walk past the person behind you after you've ordered without getting really close to them.  NOT easy to maintain good social distancing.  

The staff was friendly but overall it felt like the place was really understaffed.  It took a long time for someone to just come and take our order.  They had a dessert menu but it wasn't posted anywhere (though the regular menu was visible in 4+ locations).  So it took time for someone to come help us, it didn't take long for them to find the dessert menu but it would have been faster for me to order if I'd been able to see it before I got to the order point.  Anyway finally did get my order placed, finally paid for and signed for and it did arrive.  

Overall process took too long to get a slice of pie, but the pie was very good.  SUPER tart so be aware of that.  Default comes with chopped almonds on top and some strawberry(?) sauce drizzled under it.  Also some whipped cream.  Hubby liked how tart it was (and he's very picky about this) but he doesn't like almonds or the strawberry sauce so he was bummed by the unexpected fanciness.

As the pandemic gets worse I'm finding self care to keep one grounded is so important. I also feel that now many businesses have put into place proper sanitation and safety measures whereas in the beginning many were lost on what to do. At Fuchsia they really meet the mark on safety and cleanliness. They require guests wear a mask in all treatment areas of course unless the service you are receiving requires mask removal- ie. Facials/Laser I enjoyed a one hour massage and one hour facial for the first time guest special of an amazing $125 that was gifted to me for my birthday. Upon arrival they greet you and very welcoming and friendly. I got a little lost since it was my first time going in. They helped me find my way and were very accommodating to me being maybe 5 mins late. Once they bring you in they offer you hot tea or fruit infused water. They have a ""quiet room"" where the lights are dimmed- chandelier, couch area and a comfy chair, a table with magazines and a beautiful and relaxing faux fireplace with the relaxing spa music going as well. They also let you graze on as many peanut m&ms as you can eat while you're there. Which is cool since you can literally be in there for hours! All of their tables are heated which feels so good! My appointment started at 1 pm and I didn't get out until about 5:30. Nicole gave me my massage which was very nice and relaxing- they ask you keep your mask on during the massage. As you move throughout treatment areas they give you a wrap, robe and slippers along with a basket to put your personal belongings that they move for you wherever you ho. You may remove your mask during a massage  for a short portion of time when you are laying on your face in the rest if you'd like. Every staff member remains masked in the building and they ask that you do too. The spa is kept very clean and they are constantly sanitizing. Tracy gave me an amazing facial and scalp massage that literally almost put me to sleep- I HIGHLY recommend Tracy! After my massage I decided to just make a day of it- they quickly sent in someone from the front desk to go over options to add on a mani-pedi. Never did I feel pushed or pressured to purchase products or extras which was really nice. I opted for their seasonal pedicure that includes the usual spa pedi plus an awesome paraffin wax and a seasonal mocktail- cranberry. Which was very yummy! I got the pink mani and then upgraded to shellac. Dina is an absolute sweetheart. I enjoyed my spa day from start to finish and highly recommend them.

She looks for these mainly to appease my addiction to new places and writing reviews. I love reviewing places and searching for the best places to go in the TV.

The Broken Yoke is yet another chain. I'm not really a fan of chains as their food tends to reflect mass production and they more often than not lack originality. With Covid going on though, If I were thinking on opening a restaurant, going with an established chain if the safest way to go.

I am from Texas, so anytime I see a Chicken Fried Steak (CFS) on a menu, this is what I have to order. Its a compulsion. Unlike the rest of the country, in Texas, there is a bit of a variation from the 4 major food groups. They are;

Fried Food
CFS
Mexican food
and Potatoes

I saw a CFS on the menu and I was hooked. I was not capable at the moment of ordering anything else. My wife had an omelette and hash browns, which is her go to breakfast food.

The 1st thing of note is the menu. Its in the shape of an egg. More places would do well to take note of little things like this to make them different. It made me want to read through the menu!

The next thing I noticed was something called the BYC challenge. Its a 32 egg (I think but I was not able to find this on their web site) potatoes and more. If you can finish it, you get it for free. A nice hook, but if you eat this many eggs in 1 sitting, my guess is your next stop may well be the local hospital. 

Can you say Cholesterol clogged arteries?

When rating a CFS, I have to go with a Texas scale and an Idaho scale due to the fact that its an Idaho dish that is attempting to replicate a staple of Texas.

The steak was tender, but it just had a breading. This is the norm is Idaho, but not Texas at all. The steak was not real steak. It was just ground beef which no Texan would dare make their CFS out of. It had no flavor except for the gravy which was more of a darker gravy that white with pieces of sausage in it.

On my Idaho scale, I give it a 2. On a Texas scale, I give it a -4

I ordered my eggs scrambled, but as expected, they were not scrambled at all. They were cut up pieces of omelet. This is typical though of breakfast places in Idaho. I have yet to find a restaurant that knows how to cook real scrambled eggs. Scrambled eggs should be fluffy, and light so when you put them into your mouth they melt and give you a good egg flavor. 

I give them a 1

What they do know how to do here is hash browns. They are crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside like they should be. Also of note was the toast which instead of just plain slices of bread was more akin to Texas Toast.

The star here by a landslide was the waitress. She was very friendly, funny and a pleasure to be served by. Jamie made the meal. 

I would say that overall, the food was a little better than a Dennie's.",2021-01-04 18:59:22,653,2904,

The way they take their safety measures is very thorough, no one sat next to each other and the way the restaurant seating was arranged was so that no one is directly behind another party. They utilized QR scanning for the virtual menu.

As for my dining experience, I was excited to see that the place was BYOB-  noted for next time! I went with a friend and I ordered the Lemon Pancakes with a side of sausage(4). She ended up getting the Huevos Rancheros(HR)  with a side of fruit (one cut banana, bluerberries, and strawberry).  We ended up sharing our dishes and here is my take:

The Huevos Rancheros tortilla on the bottom was nice and CRISPY!! which added an element of texture to the dish which I thought was awesome! The HR held up and was not soggy even after 15 minutes of switching back and forth from fruit to sausage. The HR came with a side of their home made spicy sauce which was predominantly pepper and honey which tasted great with their home fries as part of the HR dish.

The lemon pancakes were nice and fluffy! It comes with 3 pancakes, powdered sugar, cut strawberry for garnish, home made whip cream and honey. Personally, I thought the  honey took away from the lemon flavor. The strawberry, piece of lemon pancake and whip cream was *chefs kiss*. 

The portion sizes are perfect for one person. I would've easily crushed the three pancakes though I went ham on the sausages (4). 

Would go here again :)",2021-01-25 21:59:18,312,1503,

Yesterday I came in to get some work done with a friend visiting from out of town, and right from the get go we were taken care of. 
COVID protocols were in place, and we had our temperature checked at the door, and everyone was wearing a mask (and properly, too!). The staff made sure to find us seats with an outlet, as we were there to work, and pointed out a couple of other options for us as well. 
Then Jade came by and introduced himself as our server. It felt like we had known him for years. He took our coffee orders and lunch orders soon after, and had a great understanding of a menu that had apparently just changed to include a few new items. 
It didn't take long for our food to arrive --the shrimp po-boy and the grilled cheese-- and it was amazing. The grilled cheese was made to perfection, and flawless despite being new to the menu, as was the po-boy. Maybe it's just me, but the po-boy was a challenging sandwich to eat as is, so I ate it deconstructed, layer by layer, but either way I'll be ordering it again next time. 
Jade was careful to check in on us at the best times, and never did catch us off guard with a question when our mouths were full --a tiny detail, but always appreciated. He made sure to check in regularly, but not too much, as he recognized we were trying to get work done, which didn't go unnoticed. Refills came promptly, and here and there he offered us drinks --""you're working hard, you deserve it"". 
We stayed there so long, Jade's shift ended, so he graciously passed us off to Madison who took over for us into the evening, and as he left, he made sure to stop by for a quick parting chat, and he couldn't have been nicer if he tried. His service is outstanding, and we'll be asking for him when we come back! 
Madison was equally as lovely, handling our desert and drinks when we finally finished working for the day. My friend ordered an Old Fashioned and the banana creme pie, and I had the Gravel Bar Cab and the coconut rice pudding --absolutely delicious. 
We had such a lovely afternoon at Pinewood and I can't wait to come back again with more of my friends!

PS: Give Jade a raise! He's a stellar employee.",2021-01-27 12:12:09,507,2302,

There may be long lines to check in, but remember COVID is among us. 6 ft spaces and disinfectant after every check in. Check in was only prob 15 mins for me and I arrived around 12 am. It was about 7 people in front of me checking in and the clerks got through us quick. Bell hop was extremely pleasant; they gave us time after the incident to get settled into our room before they brought our luggage up. I seriously can't nor will I stop raving about the hotel. 


Came to Reno for my nephews 8th birthday. We all decided to stay here at the GSR. My first time staying here and I will always recommend you guys. I'm so grateful to all the women in the ladies room next to the cafe that helped me with my toddler. My toddler got a hold of some pepper spray and accidentally sprayed himself while we were checking in. I was breaking down in the 2nd street cafe lookin for whole milk to flush my baby face. They had no milk, but it was younger guy (I'm not sure if he is Asian or not) but he has black hair and he works there. He found me some milk... honestly, Idk where but he came back with it in less than 30 secs. I left all my things in the cafe, and he took them to security and also notified the manager. Manager (I can't remember her name) but she was definitely heaven sent. She got the ambulance there and walked me to security and took care of us. I'm overly thankful for EVERYONE in the hotel, because during the chaos I lost my mask while I was crying, shaking, and she literally stood there and rubbed my shoulder the whole time. I know COVID is among us, but in that time I'm extremely blessed and thankful that all those caring humans were there. I was far away from home, my mom couldn't help because she wasn't there. I felt so helpless and everyone from the women in the restroom to the manager made me feel like my village was right there with me.


Thank you guys so much. I attached pictures of the cafe that I recommend and my son smiling 20 mins after getting his eyes flushed.",2021-01-26 00:22:00,460,2113,

We were the first customers in the restaurant. Our server was Michael and he was training May. Although later there would be discussionon who the trainee was. The food was fine, the chicken Trio being far better than the quality of the sirloin. The real issue was the service. Michael, our server, was very abrupt. As soon as he came, he was gone leaving me with questions and orders to be taken. Every time he came to check on us or take an order, I could barely get the words out of my mouth before he had turned away and was walking the other direction. Twice when he brought me back one item, I had to ask for another item, that he had not previously waited to hear me request the first time he was there. The epitomy of the meal was when we ordered dessert. We ordered the cannoli for us and a brownie to take home to the children. The cannoli was quite clearly freezer burned. The shell tasted much like the shell of an egg roll and had that odd refrigerated flavor. The brownie was dry and also had that odd refrigerated flavor. While we discussed whether we should just accept our losses and leave, I decided that $20 in desert was not worse our silence. We had already paid at this point, so it took some doing to bring Michael back to our table. He was having another conversation, but I managed to catch the eye of the other server and she motioned him to come over. When he came back to us, I politely explained the issue and apologized for our dissatisfaction. Without saying one or any regard to our experience, he whisked the deserts and our check away. He came back, again with no apology, and gave us our new bill. That was the last we saw of Michael. I'm just sad that this is the experience we had at Carrabba's on Oracle Road and Ina. I have been to the location at the Superstition Springs Mall in Mesa Arizona, and not only has the food been delicious, but the service has been excellent. Today was truly a disappointment, a very expensive disappointment. And considering that the manager did not even come over to apologize, we will go to Olive Garden next time. I have been a server in the past, and my manager always came to amend any misgivings during a customer's visit.

My husband loves the avocado eggs Benedict (can't remember the exact name on the menu) but we have been there three time. Background I have a gluten allergy I just developed recently so still learning. First time we went there I ordered a Cuban on UDI gluten free bread. It came out on a roll.  I took a couple bites and there was no way it was gluten free but knowing the waitress was celiac I didn't think about it at first. But questioned after a few bites and sure enough the kitchen didn't prep it with gluten free bread. Waitress and management were very apologetic and comped the meal and gave us a gift certificate. A few months passed decided to try again. I got the chop chop salad and turkey chili guaranteed gluten free. All good. Then my husband was craving the avacado eggs Benedict he ordered so we went back. I ordered the same on gluten free bread. Got two bites and realized again it wasn't gluten free. Saw it was one piece of bread vs 2 so actually flagged down someone who wasnt waiting on us to ask if gluten free and the manager came over immediate apologized and again same routine as the first time but 2 of 3 for the order wrong. I am still learning and have gotten gluten free rolls from the grocery store so wasn't sure. Thank goodness I am not celiac but was def uncomfortable later that day. The kitchen did make it right but the waiter grabbed the wrong dish. Just think more education is needed. Very very nervous to go back.  I honestly hate being 'that person' but realize I have to notify of my allergy but even though I did the waiter wasn't paying attention. I understand new staff but if I am letting them know please pay attention.,2021-01-01 00:44:55,350,1701,

I couldn't smile for 3 months. My brows and especially my cheeks were obviously unsymmetrical.I received filler 1ml under the eyes and I have lumps that have never smoothed out and are placed lower than the hollow portions I was wanting addressed. She injected too low. I followed up about my concerns and I was told it would subside in a month. It never did and I wake up with swelling every morning. I have a lumpy face and look a lot older than before. The lumps are blue and resemble bruising and I look like I have black eyes. Weeks before I realized things would not get any better and I was indeed botched I purchased a special over the phone for botox for the future. Wanting another professional opinion I went to The Vein center and was informed the placement of the filler was poorly done and needed to be dissolved to correct.  I then called Golden Glow to ask for a refund because I was unhappy with the service and the young front desk girl said they couldn't. I explained I do not trust the physician's skills to preform anymore procedures on me and asked to speak to the office manager or Doctor herself. She then proceeded to tell my neither were in and ""No matter what she will not refund you""! Her exact words!!! I was blown away with the disrespect. I the. Asked to speak to a supervisor and she said she will be in tomorrow and she will have her call me back and said again ""she is not going to refund you""! Speaking for her!!! This is the most unprofessional treatment I have ever received in a clinic. I was polite the entire time even up until the end.

I disputed the charge to my credit card right after the call. I never received a call back from Golden Glow. I just received a charge back of the money because Golden Glow disputed it saying I received merchandise in exchange for the service I prepaid for that I never received. I haven't set foot in that office since my initial visit. I was adamant about not wanting anything from them and just needing my money back.  I am blown away they lied and essentially stole from me. I have to get a lawyer and further disputed the claim because of all this. How can an office ethically do this!?

My friend an I both went to her ""our first time"". She received lips and botox and also got botched. Her lips are noticeably unsymmetrical and her botox was way over done. Her review is posted in google. She expressed concerns and was treated similarly.

In the spring you can purchase beautiful baskets of annual flowers and usually some perennials. In the fall you'll find pumpkins, unique gords, bales of straw, cornstalks and beautiful mums. Try their scrumptious Carmel Apples with or without nuts and candies. I love the Carmel Apples!!  Keep Famous Tomato in mind when you begin planting spring flowers or decorating for fall.

Fresh fruit and produce, lettuce, zucchini, squash, onions, cucumbers, celery, potatoes and more are in the coolers just as you enter. Famous Tomato is known for their old-fashioned candies, sodas and hot sauces. They have walls of each with numerous flavors of Taffy and candies. The salsas and hot sauces are impressive and fun to sample your way through. I have to be honest, I have purchased  several just because of the names. Some are quite funny.

One of us got the black pearl drink, and while it was tasty, she did not appreciate seeing the word ""plantation"" used as an adjective to describe the pineapple rum. It's officially 2021 and your restaurant is in New Orleans: have some goddam respect and get rid of that stupid and offensive word. The cherry gose was good. For apps, we started with the fried alligator (because NOLA YOLO!) and the gumbo. The gator was way too chewy and ""exotic"" for one of us but the other one happily ate it. The gumbo was perfection: salty, smoky, rich, spicy. We couldn't get enough of it and it was probably our favorite dish of the night. For dinner we split the rabbit and dumplings, and we have to say that it was kind of lame. The rabbit got lost in the rich roux and the whole thing just ended up tasting like your average chicken-and dumplings dish--not bad, per se, but we expected better. Kiddo was happy with her side of mac-n-cheese. The strawberry mousse pie was also unimpressive since the crust was way too thick and hard towards the back and thereby impossible to eat, and the mousse was too airy so the whole thing didn't really work well as a unit.

My $14 glass of wine had turned, also. I didn't mention it to the server because I felt awkward but for that price, I really should have.

I'm guessing that the server used the last of a bottle that had been open for a few days. The reason I said that the atmosphere was bad is that there was very loud shitty pop music playing. And a group of young intoxicated people sat down next to me and were talking and borderline-arguing loudly too, which did not help. The type of music & its volume did not fit with the otherwise bohemian and romantic vibe of the place. Other than the obnoxious group, it was myself and a couple of other people there, who were each sitting alone at a table, too. I had wanted to read a book and enjoy a glass of wine (that had not turned bad) but the music was so loud and grating that I just left as soon as possible.

I have a primary dentist. They are not open on weekends and I understood this office to offer Emergency and Urgent services. When one of my crowns started causing me blinding pain and difficulty sleeping and eating as well as intense headaches, I attempted to come here on a Saturday as a walk-in. Everything was great at first! Checkin and communication around it were very smooth with almost no wait time.

Then someone came back and took Xrays. They took quite a few and asked me questions about my crowns and when I had them done etc... all run of the mill. There seemed to be little to no interest in what my experience was/actual history of the reason for my visit. They did not even look in my mouth which I thought was odd. The doctor told me that they would not want to actually do anything and my primary dentist should handle anything further because they would know what my pre-crown Xrays would look like and that I should just go back to them. I was frustrated and annoyed by this because I didn't pay money and drive 30 minutes to be told to call my other dentist when they opened again in 2 days. 

A saving grace was an offer to get me an antibiotic and something to manage the pain until I could get in to see them. I advised them verbally (as I already had on the paperwork at checkin) that I was currently being prescribed an antibiotic from a doctor for a sinus infection. They said that was fine and they would just send me for the pain medication. Some type of prescription strength tylenol... They took my pharmacy information down and I clarified questions about how long it would take, etc... They said it would probably be ready in about an hour pending my pharmacy speed.

2.5 hours later having heard nothing from my pharmacy I called. No prescription had been sent. I called this office again and they said they would send the antibiotic right over. I repeated again that I didn't need it and ran them through that conversation. The receptionist then spoke to the doctor and expressed confusion over why I was calling. I reminded them about the pain medication. She said that their doctor had told me to get that through my primary physician. That had NEVER been spoken of. I don't even have a primary care doctor this was supposed to be temporary pain management until I could get an other appointment. She said their doctor would not give me any prescription unless I was planning on coming back for further treatment at this office. That was NEVER told to me. In fact I had been told to go ELSEWHERE for treatment as they didn't want to do anything.",2021-01-23 23:15:42,610,3080,

That is how much I dig this place. Alma is a great addition to bywater neighborhood. Small yet exquisite honduran restaurant located at the corner of two streets, Alma offers excellent breakfast, snack, and brunch options. They have both outside and inside sitting but if you don't want to wait, I would suggest you to wake up early and get there as it takes literally two seconds to fill this place up. During the weekend, avoid the prime time (noon) if you do not want to wait outside. If I am not mistaken, They don't take a reservation. 

Okay forget about the food for now. I know - it's a restaurant but their coffee... is from out of this world... I do not live nearby Alma yet I will get up on a freezing cold winter day just to get their cappuccino (get it with oat milk). 

Food wise, I really have nothing to complain about. I tried little bit of everything off of the menu and it has been fantastic. I have never tried Honduran cuisine before but Alma definitely made me a fan of it after just one visit. 

One of the highlights of this restaurant for me is the owner/chef, Melissa. She is pretty much what New Orleans stands for - Warm hospitality, fun and friendliness. She always comes say hello to her customers and makes sure we are all taken care of to her standard. 

Shout out to John who has been so lovely every time we stop by and honestly, everyone who works there has been so nice. I was told that Alma got the OK sign for alcohol sale from the city so I CANNOT wait to try some. See you this weekend probably haha.",2021-01-29 18:00:44,347,1643,

Hey, all you drinkers out there! Stones is in my opinion the best beer shop in all of Philadelphia!! 
====
Pros:
* Constantly rotating isle of amazing craft and hard to find beers
* Unbeatable pricing
* Always clean (like seriously cleaner than most restaurants!)
* Fastest credit card terminal checkouts in all of history. Literally, the time it takes to get your credit card out of the wallet takes longer than these lighting fast checkout machines. 
* Free parking right in front.
* Delivery options (if I did not live 1 block away I would take advantage).
* All staff are super helpful and knowledge and the owner employs lots of 
locals from the neighborhood.
* New signage is looking rad
* Open layout and labels galore makes it easy to find whatever you need.
* As a non-alcoholic drinker who still likes to enjoy the taste of craft beers but unfortunately has a ruined pancreas, I have to turn to the non-alcoholic beer section. Usually, most shops have one or two options and that's it. Stones make sure to keep the shelves stocked so we NA guys have some options to keep us happy. 
======
Cons: 
Does getting a beer belly count? I know it's not their fault but I needed a con.
===
When I said we live 1 block away, I was not kidding. Our street shares the same back alley as the building. Making turns at the end of our street proved to be difficult and very dangerous. The owner (Nick) knew our street's visibility issue and he generously offered to pay for one of those huge convex circle mirrors to help our street out. It fixed the issue perfectly!!! Stones and Nick are our heroes. Nick had zero obligation to do so but did so out of kindness. That's the kind of shop we are talking about here. Someone who cares deeply about the neighborhood and its community. 
 
All in all, this spot is a true gem and we are very lucky to have it. Keep it up!",2021-01-20 02:41:39,418,1980,

I ordered the crispy duck breast which was unbelievably good.  The crispy skin was fantastic, the sauce was so tasty, and the meat juicy and so tender.  I had started with the smoked salmon and horseradish-cream cheese spread and toasted bread, and I couldn't quit eating it even though I knew I'd be ordering an entree.  My husband's cold octopus salad, pasta with Italian sausage, and sour orange meringue pie were definite hits with him.
We had not been to a sit down restaurant with waitstaff since March.  He was especially leery.  We couldn't believe just how careful the staff were to keep us all safe from Covid. After a table of customers left, the table cloth, vase of fresh flowers, and pump bottle of hand sanitizer were removed.  The table, every chair at the table (whether used or not), the vase, and the sanitizer were all wiped down with sanitizer (which was liberally applied to table and chairs).  Then a fresh table cloth was placed on the table and the sanitized vase and pump bottle were returned.  Every server wore a mask and gloves. All other employee had on masks.
All customers were required to wear a mask unless seated at their table.  Tables were at least ten feet apart.  Though there was a chill in the air as we requested outdoor seating, the propane heaters kept us toasty (even down to my bare feet in flip-flops).

I've had a lot of cancellations and someone asked me to work that day so I did, even though it was a holiday.  It was a long week and that was a really long day of physical labor without a break, a deep houseclean, while family of five was out of town.   I was up on a ladder part of the time and down on the floor, the rest, often on my knees.  During the course of cleaning, I broke a bulb in the client's oven so after finishing the job, drove to Home Depot to get one.  First of all you guys were open until 8, which gave me time to get there...a twenty minute drive.  Then I had to drive back.  I was EXHAUSTED when I walked into the store.  I headed straight toward an associate coming my way.  I asked him where the appliance bulbs were.  Not only did he tell me where, he walked me over and made sure I got the exact kind I had broken.  It was hard to read because the bulb was pretty messed up. I'm a senior and didn't have reading glasses on me, so that meant a lot.  We found the exact bulb. Then I walked straight across to the service counter where the associate kindly checked me out.  I didn't get the cashier's name but the person who helped me find the bulb was Kyle G.  Super nice and professional Home Depot associates, both of them.  Kudos to the management in there!!!",2021-01-06 02:33:11,317,1406,

Have for years been wanting to sit on the front porch of the Columns hotel and watch the street car go by and enjoy a wonderful brunch. I know we can't have jazz but arrive and we were the only people there?? That is your first sign! Second the menu had no breakfast items for brunch! Not even a piece of bacon!! A main item on the menu was French fries for $10?!?! I can go to Macdonald and get $1 French fry that is the best fries in the world! What is going on here, hostess said there is new owners and they don't control the menu?? But does the Owner not eat there to check the quality and type of food that is being served in their restaurant. So after five minutes being so let down looking over the menu we decided to get up and leave. Went down the street to an amazing restaurant who got us in even though they had a full house with amazing food. Notice I said amazing food and brunch food at that and they were booked solid. So you have an iconic hotel with front porch and French fries and no brunch and empty and another restaurant down the street with a line out the door and serving $150-$250 tickets per table booked solid?! We can't say it's because of Covid because most restaurants we visit have a full menu and locals are still eating out.. let's hope Columns takes note and makes changes for the better.

We arrived at 7:40pm on a Thursday and the restaurant was pretty empty. We ordered drinks which got delivered. From there 20 minutes goes by and our waiter hasn't been back to attend to us. The manager Matt Pickett drops drinks off to the table next to us and i got his attention. I explained how the waiter had yet to come back and how unhappy i was with the wait since we were pretty hungry. He apologized and asked us what we wanted to order. I had to explain to him we're first time patrons and i heard about them offering different salts from across the county, that's when he began to give his introduction (as a new customer i shouldn't have to inquire for you to introduce your restaurant). He explained the salts comes with the bread which was never brought out originally. Shortly thereafter, they brought out the bread. Honestly i don't think the bread and salts would of been delivered if i didn't mentioned it to begin with. Furthermore, We were able to place our orders which was the Yellow Tail Snapper (whole fish) and the Branzino (whole fish). Matt Pickett came back roughly 5 minutes later and explained that someone just ordered the last Snapper. At this point I'm pretty upset given the facts we were seated for 25-30 minutes without the opportunity to order. I feel if we were handled appropriately, we would of been the ones to order that last Snapper which was the whole reason we went in the first place. Reluctantly i had to order the Branzino instead. Our original waiter came back to our table and i explained how he dropped the ball and his response was ""well sorry"" and walks off. I couldn't take anymore. We walked to the hostess station to pay for our drinks and proceeded to patronize Ruth Chris instead since it was across the street. I explained to the Matt Pickett again how i felt and how i thought the situation should have been handled and he says ""i apologize you feel that way"" and that was it. He was very dismissive and nonchalant about the whole situation and no i don't think he genuinely cared whatsoever. I felt judged from the minute we sat down. This was a VERY poor experience and after sharing my experience with others, this is not an isolated situation!

We walked to Ruth Chris which was very close. They sat us immediately. Our waiter came within 3-4 minutes, introduced herself, asked us if we had been there before and went into her introduction. We briefly explained the experience we had with Sea Salt, they apologized on their behalf and assured us they'll do everything in their power to make sure our experience was enjoyable. After we enjoyed our food (which was AMAZING by the way), our waiter brought over the check. Shortly thereafter, the manager came over and explained how he heard about our lackluster experience with Sea Salt and proceeded to give us four $25 gift certificates to make up for a terrible dining experience that had nothing at all to do with them. We certainly weren't expecting this but it was greatly appreciated! I'm a big proponent of customer service and Sea Salt failed miserably! Luckily Ruth Chris was there to save our evening.

You must sign their legal release that states ""All sales are final, no refund on parts or labor""! Your credit card company will not accept a dispute under any circumstances.  I purchased a tire from them and after road testing, there was a noticeable vibration in the tire. Calvert's was too busy to examine their tire until the next day. So I took the car to CarX to make sure my other tires were in balance and not contributing to the problem. They told me the new tire Calvert's supplied would not balance and was in their opinion defective.  I brought the car back to Calvert's and they made all kinds of excuses and would not replace the tire. They claimed they would have to submit the tire for warranty replacement even though the tire was only 3 days old! I don't why they just couldn't have called their wholesale supplier and bring in a new tire. I was leaving on a 1200 mile road trip the next day and was unwilling to drive  the car with an obviously defective tire. I took the car to  Firestone had them check the tire, they also determined it was defective and subsequently purchased a new tire from them. Highly recommend Firestone by the way. I took the original defective tire back to Calvert's and I received a receipt from the staff for the return of the tire. They said they could not give refund on the spot but would submit the tire for warranty or credit my credit card. They did neither. Over a 2 month period, and after 5 phone calls to their corporate offices each time they promised to call me back and NEVER did so. Zero communication. After 2 months, I took the matter to the BBB and do you remember the legal release I signed at time of purchase? Well that document was used in their response that I had no recourse ""all sales are final"" but offered a partial refund.  However in order to get the refund they required me to sign a 5 page ""Confidential Release and Settlement Agreement"" that basically asked me to attest that I had engaged an attorney to review the document and threatened a $25,000 penalty if I disclose any details of the settlement or my service experience even with friends or family. For obvious reasons I refused to sign it and subsequently I'm out $220. Ok, they can keep my money if they need it so desperately.

It is in the old Johnny Rockets at castleton square. All of the employees were wearing masks and masks were required to enter. They did have a sanitizing station as soon as you walked in the door. There was only one other table of guests there when we arrived and it was seat yourself so social distancing was not an issue. 
We were immediately greeted by a server / waitress that wiped down the table for us. She took our drink orders and left us with the menus. They have a very large menu and a very wide variety of things to choose from. 
We had the beef filled Sambosek for an appetizer. Goodness, it was so fresh, hot, flaky and wonderful.  
I chose the Pastitsio. The portion size was huge. It had a lot of cheese in it and it was very tasty although it was a tad on the dry side, like a sauce was missing. But aside from that the flavor was wonderful! It was served with the tiny little salad on the same plate that was minimal but it was very tasty. 
My husband had the lamb Souvlaki meal. The lamb was seasoned well, the rice was a little spicy, but was very good. It came with pita bread and tzatziki sauce. Very tasty.  Our friend had the chicken version of the same meal.
For dessert I had GALAKTOBOUREKO a very flaky crust filled with custard and dusted with powdered sugar and I think caramel..... It was the flakiest and lightest and tastiest thing I've had in a long time. There's really nothing to even compare it to. But it was delicious. Our friend had Baklava and said it was great. My husband had OUM ALI....puff pastry, milk, nuts....he said like bread pudding, only wetter. 
The staff was super friendly, very attentive, helpful with the menu suggestions. The only negative think I can say is they serve their soft drinks in cans. No ice or glass offering. But, very inexpensive, VERY good and we will certainly visit again.",2021-01-17 03:46:48,410,1941,

BUT, and it's a big but and I cannot lie, the three others in my party all had screw-ups with their order to the point that they would have been returned if we weren't all starving and lacked the desire to spend gas and time to return to the restaurant. COVID SUCKS!! If it wasn't for COVID, this expensive order would have been returned.  

Given this experience, I probably won't order again from TAP until indoor dining returns and I can return food.

I would comment that it's over priced, but I recently moved back from 20 years in LA, so I was spoiled (the competition for Thai in LA wouldn't support these prices). But really, the price is based on what the market will bear, and I haven't had any better or any worse Thai food in Santa Barbara.

TO TAP: I would suggest having a ""heat"" scale based on 1-10. A ""1"" you could serve a baby. A ""5"" is average Thai spicy (not American spicy), and 10 is the hottest you can serve without violating laws or being required to acquire additional insurance. Add a sentence ""we really don't suggest going above a 4 unless you're familiar with really authentic Thai"" or something similar

I had a 7 one time based on a similar scale (in Vegas). I ended up having to see a Urologist the next day because what goes in must come out, but I felt blissfully enlightened (if also on fire) while I ate it.",2021-01-13 02:08:41,316,1420,

The outside of the building is a beautiful limestone with brick sidewalks that lead you to the Garage, the soon to be shopping center full of local businesses. There is also an old fashioned movie theater that just opened next to it, Living Room Theaters.

While the fun surroundings make for a perfect location, the inside of the hotel has its own gems. The lobby is stunning. As you walk in, the hotel bellhops greet you and hold open the heavy bronze doors. The first thing you'll notice might be the colorful array of tiled walls or the red velvet couch. But the thing that surprised me most was the smell of the building. It was this musky pine cologne smell that made me want to cozy up in bed and read a good book. 

The rest of the hotel was just as stunning. I took a tour before booking my stay. The girl who gave us a tour showed us the grand stair case. A spectacular spiral stair case made of marble steps and steel railings. She then showed us the restored offices of the two brothers who owned the plant, which will be used as conference rooms. Something that was quite unique was the bottling room, a floor to ceiling teal tiled room used for capping the bottles. I just loved that they restored these rooms to their former glory making them special to this hotel's history. 

Other highlights of the tour included the second floor corridors that had beautiful black and white photos of people from the past and present. In fact some of the people on the walls were construction workers from when the hotel was being renovated. Photography seemed to be a continued theme of this floor as there is an old school photo booth at the end of the second floor with a wall decorated with old and new cameras. 

After taking the tour, I booked my stay in a double Queen room for NYE. The room felt more like a luxury apartment than a hotel room. Everything was so finely selected from the cute little red velvet pillows to the mini bar stocked with local spirits. And don't get me started about the amazing bathroom! The double shower head along with marble and hold fixtures made you feel like you were showering like royalty. All of these details really made the stay that more special.

To sum it up, this stay was pretty amazing. But it wouldn't have been a 5 star stay if it weren't for the staff. I cannot believe how well run this hotel is for just opening. Everyone who worked there from the bellhops to the front desk management were professionals who treated every guest with respect and kindness. I have to give a special recognition to Kayla who gave us the tour. If it wasn't for her taking the time to show us the hotel and sharing so much about the history and future of the hotel, we would have never known how truly special Bottleworks is.

There were some others that came close but they seem to have dropped in quality while Kanno has consistently been excellent.  When I first heard about this place many years ago I was extremely skeptical as it used to be in a bit of a shady strip mall in Fat City and it didn't look that good outside or inside but once I tasted the food none of that mattered and now they have been in a very upgraded location for several years and just keep getting better.  They have a fantastic selection of so many unique and creative rolls that are fantastically delicious along with an amazing soft shell crab spicy miso soup!  

Elvis and his wife are the owners and work the sushi bar (and maybe you would guess there is a lot of Elvis artwork).  They have reserved seating for their VIP customers that eat there like twice a day as it is that GOOD!!!  You have to earn your spot in the reserved section so don't even try to sit in that area.  Everything I've had here has been outstanding and if you're really good they give you a tasty little frozen chocolate treat for dessert.  There hours have been more limited during the pandemic situation and during normal times they usually take a long holiday back to Japan once a year so you might want to call to make sure they are open and what the current hours are but they usually are and it is definitely worth a visit multiple times a week!!!  This is a smaller restaurant and with the pandemic lower capacity requirements you need to make a reservation to dine inside the restaurant.

My husband went for the buffalo burger again, but it had way too much of the garlic cheese spread, he didn't even finish it this time.  I ordered the hurt locker and ended up with the ring of fire, which had a super hard bun.  And one of my kids ordered the steakhouse burger which came without the bacon ().  To top it off the food came out at varying times, and one person was left in that awkward moment of being the only person at the table without food.  Needless to say, the disappointment was high.

The ambiance inside (and outside) is cute- lots of Mexican paintings on the walls with lights strung all around the restaurant (including lanterns/chandeliers). Very eclectic vibe. The patio looked really neat as well, was just too cold to sit out there.

For an appetizer I ordered the nachos and white queso- the chips were fresh and salty, the queso was filled with green chiles and was really tasty. For my main meal I ordered street corn and a few tacos- the chicken tinga, cilantro-lime steak, crispy potato, and the campaña (beef). The potato taco was SPICY, I wasn't able to finish it (the aioli must have been spicy), the beef taco was average, but the chicken and the steak tacos were out of this world!! Really, really delicious!!  Several different ingredients in each taco, all blend together perfectly. All tacos are on the small side, so they're made to order a few; I feel the point reflects that. You are also able to order corn or flour tortillas (flour may not be ""authentic"", but it's all I eat, so I was thrilled to have the option.)

The street corn comes on OR off the cob (just ask), and was some of the best street corn I have had- the right amount of spices and cojita cheese. The margaritas aren't strong or overpowering, but the flavors are there!! (Try the spicy one!)

I allow my clients to break contracts if they come to me and tell me they have been affected by finacial hardships.  The reason I do that-I care about everyone who I am able to help and want them to think positive of the company and me.",2021-01-06 15:58:35,369,1810,

I'm a simple girl, I like long, black nails on my hands and black toes too. But it's still hard for the perfectionist in me to find a place that does it, well, perfectly. This is that place. My girl Vicky has a keen eye for detail and went back several times to make sure all my claws were even. She also asked me on multiple occasions if I liked what I saw. Y'all, if you don't like it, PLEASE please please say something because they ask! They want you to feel like the goddess that you are. And we all know that sometimes people come here to vent when they could have just spoken up. 

I also got a pedicure and honestly for $25 it was pretty great! You get hot stones, a warm towel, you get a nice leg/foot scrub and a massage. It wasn't too long but I still walked out feeling really good. 

As for how they're handling things during COVID because I am sure everybody wants to know, they wear masks (over the nose, too. Bonus points!), you wear a mask, you get your temp checked and there is lots of soap and hand sani around. They do not wipe down seats which some people may not vibe with, but overall the salon is pretty immaculate. There is also plexiglass between you and your tech at all times, yes even during a pedi. 

I will say the pricing is relatively straightforward, however I kind of got the jist that the price of your nails will depend on a lot of factors like length, design, shape, blah blah blah so if that's something you're very worried about, I would give them a call and talk it out. 

I would suggest this place if you want fast, friendly, AMAZING, clean service. Enjoy!",2021-01-02 23:17:42,372,1670,
B5LsMJArZTLuiP9n3T56hA,z3QGpRty1h63nmcyTGxwcg,noRT1heGkIflS0_S2ciF2Q,5,1,0,0,"I started a new job back in September and started searching on Yelp local restaurants. I came across Ming Ming and have been wanting to check it out. I was intrigued by the extensive specialty sushi menu and the low prices. I drive past the restaurant everyday on my way home and was weary about the establishment being in a very small strip mall. I also tried to find a website with a full and clear menu and was not able to do so. 

To start with the negatives... the location is the perfect area but the strip mall itself sucks! The parking was a nightmare as it was almost completely filled up. I had to park with a power pole right behind me and the truck next to me was so long that it took a lot to maneuver out when leaving. There is another restaurant in the strip that I'm assuming is what took up most of the parking. I did research on them as well and maybe might check them out but the menu didn't excite me like Ming Ming's. I asked for a to-go menu when picking up my order and was disappointed that there were two items not viewable on the pics on Yelp that I probably would've chosen first. I wish they would've had their menu posted clearly somewhere online for those of us who are still having to be extremely cautious during the pandemic. 

The store front is very small and quaint. I'm assuming they do a lot of to-go meals as someone was leaving with a bag of food upon my arrival. There was a table of two quietly dining in the restaurant when I walked in. The second you walk in, the aroma was nothing like a sushi restaurant. I'm a sushi fanatic but have never smelled sushi. Lol I don't eat meat but love the smell of the grill and fried food. The scent is an aroma to make your mouth water regardless of what is cooking... that's what I was engulfed with entering the restaurant and had to drive home filling my car with and trying not to tear open the bag and start stuffing my face while driving. I read a fellow Yelpers review about the amount of seafood in the roll. I agree, the portions were a bit lacking but it didn't take away from the taste. That might be why they are able to keep their prices a bit lower but I will take it. Cause of that, I would probably take .5 stars away but within 30 seconds of walking in the restaurant I already knew it would be a 5 star review. I'm going to assume after research trying to find a full valid menu that I was greeted by one of the owners?? I immediately thought he was a customer as he was dressed in normal casual street wear. He was extremely pleasant and very welcoming when he greeted me at the counter. We exchanged a small conversation and after telling him I was a new customer he was very confident that I would be happy with my meal. A bit of arrogance but none the less, he obviously knows the quality. 

I do wish I was a tea drinker. The next time my mom comes in town, I'll have to bring her in and maybe be able to do some tea tasting and buy her some favorites. The only menu online to really find is the tea menu that is extensive like a regular food menu!!! I would like to try some of their boba as well as the items not viewable online. I'm posting their full menu with handwritten price changes they made on it. I will 100% be back and want to know what the vegetarian zen Inari pouches are made of and what makes them sweet. Rice filled pockets.... I didn't know what I was ordering. They are so basic but so worth it! 

In all.... yes, the fillings of seafood is less. You are also paying less for the food. The taste isn't compromised and you still feel full and satisfied afterwards. The prices and satisfaction will keep me coming back especially with them being directly in the route home from work.",2021-01-17 04:14:04,783,3705,

It's easy to find if you go to the Coca Cola Bottleworks and see the signs for the Hotel, this store is just north of the hotel on the same side of the street.  Metered parking is available on Mass Ave or there are pay lots across the street and behind the ""Garage"".  I am not aware of any validating of your parking stub for this store.  You would have to ask.

Once you find it, the store feels fresh and new, is well lit, and seems to mirror the title ""Good Neighbor"" with quality items and friendly staff.  Since it was a cold weekday just before lunch, there weren't any other customers, but the young lady who was working didn't hover over us but engaged us in conversation offering to help find anything we were looking for.  Basically, women's clothing is to the left as you enter and men's to the right.  They did have quite a bit of denim clothing, and lots of warm wear for getting us through the winter.  You can shop and then head over to the Garage Food Hall (located north of 9th street only) across Edison.  Or if you are curious, look into the lobby of the new Bottleworks Hotel which preserved much of the art deco facade.  It is a beautiful area to shop with everything clean and new, but paying homage to the past.  Check out Good Neighbor while in the area!

I walked in and ordered at 5:42pm I was told it would be 15 mins. I choose to wait in the car as the lobby was over crowded with there being a 50 minute wait for a table. I was told I would get a phone call when my order was ready. 

After 20 minutes I decided to walk in to check on my order. I was told it's not up yet. This time I decided to wait inside to save a walk. After another 20 minutes my patience is done! The server checked and my order had been ready and sitting for who knows how long under the wrong name. 

Mistakes happen I get it my name is Brittany they put it under Tiffany! 

I took the order because I was hungry and ready to go! I checked my order in the car and both orders are missing the chicken!

The manager was brought up and she simply reordered my order. After 20 more minutes of waiting I asked for the manager again to at least take something off my order. I'm normally to embarrassed to ask for anything off my order out of fear my food would be tampered with  

She advised me it would be a few more minutes. Finally after over an hour of my initial order I received my correct order.  

The manager was sympathetic and offered half off my order and gave me a gift certificate.

Even from the get-go driving in is beautiful with the long driveway, canvassed with wonderful, old trees, and near the end you are greeted with a barn on one side and a dignified inn/restaurant on the right.

We ate outside due to COVID-19, but that made the experience even more special, as we were able to observe the beautiful grounds, great landscaping, and enjoy the night air. 

The wait staff was pleasant and agreeable. It is more refined than your usual restaurant in this area, for instance, they have a bottle service, proper linens, two servers per tables, etc. I The attention to detail was top notch and my few minor requests for this or that were always observed.

Prior to being seated we were led through the inn, which looked architecturally interesting and I enjoyed the idea of observing the open-air kitchen in a post-pandemic world.

The wine list was very good with beautiful glasses and a heady range of flavors and regions.

On to the dinner menu!

For the first course, I had the Charred English Cucumber Salad which was beautifully presented and contained a bevy of textures while retaining the lightness appropriate for an appetizer. My DP enjoyed the chilled English pea soup, and probably more so the bread that accompanied the meal. ;)

For the second course, I opted for one of the specials that evening, which was the grilled octopus. The octopus was so tender and well plated. I have not had such well prepared octopi since Morimoto in Philadelphia. My DP had the smoked salmon which was again expertly plated and offered a few contrasts of textures and flavors without overdoing it.

For entrees, I opted for another special, which was the pheasant, and my DP the halibut. The pheasant was certainly interesting and enjoyable to me, as somewhat outside my usual alimentary regimen, however, it's lightness and perfect pairing of accompaniments were an excellent way to round out the meal. My DP enjoyed the halibut which was well paired too with sweet onions et al. Mixed mushrooms made a hearty side for this course and were well prepared sans an overbearing use of oils or butter.

We did not partake of dessert at this juncture, as we were both nicely sated, however, the petit fours to wrap up the meal were a pleasant and smile-provoking way to end the culinary journey.",2021-01-11 16:37:19,460,2391,

I just purchased a home and after the sellers moved out and patched every little nail hole in the place, it needed painting, the entire 1350 square feet.  My sister previously had some paint work done and she is relentless on getting a lot of quotes before choosing the best one. Well, it was Buck's Professional Painting.  I contacted them without calling any other companies for an estimate.  They were professional, friendly, honest and down to earth.  Buck and Dave came to give my estimate. Took time to go throughout the entire house.  My husband was flipping out in his mind thinking it was going to cost $7000.00. (Mind you we have never hired someone to paint our home-we have always done it ourselves). So this was a first. We were not going to take on the challenge of painting because of the vaulted ceilings and my husband was just down right retired from painting so many homes we have owned.  When we got the quote I was floored at how inexpensive it was! I thought he made a mistake ;) But because it was so reasonable, we had him also do all the trim, doors, everything!! Then I thought, let's throw in painting our garage!! I just cannot rave more about the price. Buck's Painting sends in a crew of 8 painters and it should take them entire day to do it.

I've been craving prime rib, which apparently is not a popular meat for higher end restaurants to cook. I've wrote this on an Instagram story (and multiple Yelp reviews), that I like my meat like I like my men. A friend responded ""pink?"". Yes, my husband is quite pale, but what I meant was fat. (It is a total joke, I do love my meat fatty, but I'm often trying to get my husband to get on the peloton, which he is adamantly against). 

Anyways, I found it difficult to find prime rib on many menus that offer steak. Flamestone was actually the only one near me. I went with the classic cut with campfire mixed vegetables and mashed potatoes. My husband got a filet with campfire vegetables and mashed sweet potatoes (I chose the sweet potatoes side for him to get so I could try it) and my son got the kids chicken tenders with fries. 

The prime rib was perfect. I got it medium since I'm pregnant (I hate getting meat that is cooked more than rare, but I gotta do what I gotta do for this fetus). The meat was still tender and juicy with huge chunks of fat. I loved it. I also devoured the mashed potatoes and both my husband and I agreed that the vegetables were superb. I probably wouldn't get the mashed sweet potatoes again, but honestly I'm not a huge fan of sweet potatoes so it takes a lot to wow me. (Time and time again I think maybe I like sweet potatoes more than I think.)

The kids chicken tenders were solid. My son didn't touch any of it, but that's just him.

Frankly, it isn't much to look at.  Kind of a cross between  a dive bar and a sports bar.  Very dark inside, a long bar, a number of long tables for groups to share, and some tables for smaller groups to sit at.  They have 1 or 2 outside tables, but no patio or deck to speak of - just sidewalk seating.  However, you don't come here for the atmosphere - at least I don't - you come here for the menu.

Unfortunately, i am unable to recall everything I have gotten here.  Can't seem to find all of my photos.  That said, I know I got a chicken sandwich thingy once and according to the picture's caption, I really liked it.  Also think I got the St Pete wrap and steak tip brunch.  Again, according to the captions I wrote, I loved those too.  This time around, I got the JB Bene with pulled pork and a wake up call - cold brew coffee and bourbon.

Regardless of the lack of descriptions I can provide for everything I had previously, I love this menu.  Everything I have ordered, including the JB Bene, has been delicious and their cocktails are well made, balanced, and delicious as well.  Pretty sure they do a bottomless mimosa for brunch, too.

One warning though - they are not taking covid safety precautions seriously.  When I arrived, there was room at the bar and a number of tables, but by the end, I had someone shoulder to shoulder next to me at the bar and every table was occupied.  There was no spacing, no enforcement of mask rules, nothing.  Staff, thankfully, wore masks but otherwise, this isn't a safe environment if you're worried about this pandemic.  Had it been as full when I arrived, I never would have stayed.

Still, if you've had your vaccine or simply don't care or perhaps when this is all behind us, this is definitely a must-stop for any meal, but especially brunch.",2021-01-05 20:57:06,419,1920,

We love the $85 seafood tower as it has 2x lobster tails, 12 raw oysters, 12  Very large shrimp (shrimp cocktail) 3/4 pound king crab legs and 1 pound Dungeness crab. It's served with drawn butter and cocktail sauce. 

The evening started out nice. Ordered a Cadillac Margarita on the rocks and it was perfect. Along with the Chilled seafood tower, we ordered fried calamari and a bowl of clam chowder. Hot bread was served immediately. 

The server was great, he has waited on us before and he is friendly and professional. He attends to all of our requests immediately. 

The issue started toward to end of dinner. We were the last table and the workers were gathered near the entrance to the bar with the bar tender. They were being loud and really inappropriate in conversation. There was lots of swearing and foul language. We heard one of the females talk about mustache rides and my 13 year old daughter asked what that was. I was horrified. I quickly and loudly called to the waiter (who was not part of the 'group') and told him we could hear the conversation. He went over and asked them to hold it down. This could have been the end of it, however the bar tender started calling back the the waiter loudly what was the problem. The waiter just asked him to not worry and made a motion to just pipe down. The bar tender very loudly let me know that it was Christmas and we should be happy people were here and we need to back off. 

At this point I had had enough. I yelled to the group that I had a right to eat and not listen to swearing and have my children hear nasty inappropriate comments. 

I do hope the management reads this and teaches the workers that this type of behavior is unacceptable. That bringing their personal desires or lifestyle and subjecting loyal customers to inappropriate conversation, sexually explicit comments and swearing is not acceptable.

The airport is sparsely occupied, everyone is wearing masks, double masks, and/or face shields. The seats have 6' reminders on them and I found plenty of room far away from others.

Louisiana's Soul Bayou is inside the Chow Market Place in the back corner. I came here after looking through Yelp to see what was near my hotel that I could walk to. This place popped up and by looking at the pictures, I chose it!

The food that I've tried were:
1. Catfish Po'Boy with Cajun Fries
2. Hush Puppies
3. Jambalaya: only available Friday-Sunday
4. Banana Pudding

Now for the reviews of the food:

1. Catfish Po'Boy with Cajun Fries
     I've tried a lot of catfish po'boys in California and I can honestly say that, this particular one is so light and airy. I don't know what they did with the catfish, but it's not heavy at all. Combined with the topping, the dipping sauce and the bread, it was absolutely a hit! They don't hold back on the catfish either. My po'boy was filled with the catfish, yummy! You will not regret eating the catfish po'boy at all- I can promise you that.

2. Hush Puppies
     These are deep fried cornbread puppies. Be sure to eat these when they're warm as when it gets colder, it's not as tasty.

3. Jambalaya
    As you've all read above, these are only available Friday-Sunday. This is absolutely so good!!! If these were available every single day, I'd probably buy it every single day, haha. The jambalaya was so flavorful that once I took a spoonful of it, I was hooked right away. My only regret? Not being able to order 2 orders. You will not regret this one either!

4. Banana Pudding
    The best banana pudding I've ever tasted. It had the right sweetness- not too much, not too little. My regret? Not ordering another one of this too, haha. Remember to save room for dessert for this!

Overall, this local place was amazing. Boise, you got a good one here and I'm so grateful to be able to try this spot out. There's plenty of parking and plenty of tables to eat at.

Some advice/tips I could give are to not go during rush hours for lunch. You could wait awhile if there's a huge group ordering ahead of you. However, they're pretty quick with providing quality food regardless. Also, as always, don't forget to leave tip if you're able to.

I heard the gumbo (only available Friday-Sunday) was really good. Let me know if you all had their gumbo and tell me how it was please.

Huge shout out to Jody and his crew for providing bomb food. I'll definitely be back!",2021-01-23 23:51:46,512,2333,
WQgANQpH4Bhj3Oe-ysCFNw,ZzGFXBun_hal0Gz3eYsX-A,2Mg2DziYfmUd5BKYfDQPGQ,5,4,0,4,"Cherry Bomb was an amazing company to work with, when planning my wedding. 

A couple of years ago, my wife (girlfriend at the time), asked me to come with her to an event at the Stylish Scribe. The shop is really nice and all, but as a man who was not planning a wedding at the moment, it was only able to hold my attention for so long. What did keep my attention however, were the amazing apps being passed around the room. As the only man in the shop at the time, the servers noticed I was devouring the apps that all of the other patrons were too modest to eat, and started bringing me an endless parade of snacks. Those apps were provided by Cherry Bomb and I never forgot how good they were. 

About one year ago, when my wife (fiancée at the time), and I began planning our wedding we discussed one and only one caterer; Cherry Bomb. Our experience was great right from the start. Very early on we had a call with the owner Dawn. We went over expectations and options, it was a great conversation that left my wife and I feeling very confident in our decision. Cherry Bomb offered us a variety of menus and also made sure we knew that we were not bound by only predetermined menus, and that she and her head chef Kelsi would be happy to help us curate any menu we wanted. 

About five months ago, my wife (fortunately still fiancée at the time), and I were knee deep in pandemic wedding planning. For those who haven't experienced it, a pandemic will wreak havoc on wedding plans (all plans really). At this point we had endured a sea of changing regulations and rising cases. We had considered a dozen different plans for our reimagined wedding. One thing we never had to worry about however, was our partnership with Cherry Bomb. Dawn stayed in touch with us throughout the process and kept us up to date with all of their COVID compliance policies and made sure we knew whenever a change was made. This is the way business should be done in times of uncertainty and I can't express how comforting that was to us. Even after we broke up with our original venue, Cherry Bomb didn't waver. All Dawn needed to know was where and when she would be needed.

About four months ago, my wife (yeah, still fiancée at the time), and I invited our parents to join us for a very safe and very fun tasting. We were the first to enjoy their new facility on Longley. This was my second experience with Cherry Bombs amazing hospitality and they made everyone in our party feel extremely welcome. 

About three and a half months ago, my wife (finally), and I were sitting down to enjoy our wedding meal with fifteen guests. Since we were never pressured into selecting our menu early, and we had about 75 less guests than planned, we were able to upgraded our menu to a five course meal with filet mignon and lobster as the main course. The food was delicious and the servers were very attentive. Every one of our guests received special attention. My wife and I were treated like royalty. I have no doubt that we made the right decision by hiring Cherry Bomb .",2021-01-09 07:02:15,635,3053,

The patio would be fine except for it's always smoky. They have a TV out there so, if you don't mind that smoke, and you care about being safe, it's a good place to watch a game.
For whatever reason, the food is awesome. The menu is really interesting: kimchi fried rice, arroz con pollo, a pork belly sonoran dog... And their wings are really good, with lots of different flavors. Their food is interesting enough that it is worth going in just for take out, even if you don't want to hang out. So it's like a sports bar but with good and interesting food. They have some good beers on tap too.
The staff is really nice. They've always been really nice to me when I've gone in and seem to really want to work hard to keep you coming back. It's close enough to us, and my wife is in love with that kimchi fried rice, that we do keep coming back.
The nachos is one of those polarizing items. Instead of beans, they use a bean paste on items, and use Que Bueno for the cheese. Some people may love this, but not for me. Lots of other options though, including sone entrees, wings, burgers, and different interesting sandwiches. Plus they have good kids meals. They are like $7 for chicken strips with fries, and the strips are their regular, really good, strips.
Once Covid dissipates and we all feel comfortable sitting in a room with unrelated dudes milling around at a bar, they do have a nice indoor seating area that would allow you to watch games and eat their delicious food.",2021-01-24 05:00:31,355,1595,

There was a gal who used to do such a wonderful job, she no longer works there since she became pregnant, and stayed home to care for her kids. Ever since she left I haven't had good experiences since. It's not that often that I've gone to this salon. The last experience wasn't good at all. I scheduled an appointment with Jim. He seemed pushy and rude even with setting up the appointment. I ended up missing this appointment which was my fault. It was an honest mistake. I called back in to reschedule and apologize for missing it. Jim took my call and gave me the 3rd degree for missing the appointment. He made me feel really bad for his hair stylist who apparently waited around ""all day"" for an appointment which was scheduled for the afternoon at 6pm as matter of fact. I wasn't impressed. He claimed to not have my phone number which I did give to him when scheduling the first appointment. It's on them to update that since it has changed since then. He reluctantly rescheduled for the same day, which was for 615pm. I showed to this appointment at 530pm the gal named Maria was with a customer, understandably. When 615pm came around she said she was running behind, I am pretty understanding, she said it would be another 15 minutes, I ended up waiting an additional 30 minutes. She didn't communicate after that 30 minutes has passed. She didn't look anywhere near done with her customer. I was didn't want to leave, I didn't have much of a choice, I have a life as well. The experience wasn't pleasant, and I don't have time for nonsense. I understand things happen. You'd think these people would at least communicate a little better. Not much of a loss other than my time and gas. I drive from Sierra Vista in search of good service and people. I am generous when it comes to tips. Hopefully it serves as a learning experience, no one is exempt from learning. Jim, you need to watch how you talk to people, especially you being the owner of this establishment. You'd think you'd know better. Customer service doesn't tolerate that kind of approach, not even from a manager. You want people to come back, that's not how you approach them.


Jim called back and apologized and corrected it right away. I set up another appointment the following day. It was a nice experience. Will update my follow up after the appointment.

Follow up, appointment went very well. I actually showed up an hour early, and they were able to take me in. Alyssa was wonderful, and did a great job on my hair. I'm pretty happy with my overall experience. A negative can always be turned into a positive. Thanks again.",2021-01-28 03:17:59,564,2666,

You sit around their ""open kitchen"" & you can take items off the conveyor belt. I have been twice now. It is owned/run by a mother & her daughter. Everything we tried was delicious. They use compostable utensils & they have gluten free & vegan items on the menu! I took a star off for service. Detailed review below:

*Food: I ordered the Cremé Brûlée Brie which was extremely tasty. It was served w/sweet butter & bread sticks. My friend ordered the vegan cheese which tasted so much like real cheese & it was served w/the rosemary popcorn. The wine selection is unique as well. 

*Ambiance: Casual setting as it is located in the food court area of the L&L Market. Bar stool seating around a conveyor belt. 

*Dress: Casual. 

*Prices: Most cheeses were $8 & are small portions but they're gourmet so I felt it was reasonably priced. The wines run $10-14. 

*Parking: There is a free lot out back. 

*Service: This is where I removed a star. The place is amazing & has a lot of potential, but they need more staff on the weekends. The mother & daughter are taking the orders & then running back to make them. I admire their hard work, but it took a long time to get our wine, food & bill. I know they're trying as hard as they can, but I truly think it would benefit them to hire a couple people who have a background in the service industry. 

I will return b/c I do love the place.",2021-01-13 05:01:02,326,1463,
FNHNiNo8Iry8i4Ra7F_wug,J2pUihnpf8iaW1fhpWar6w,eAShb5FJSTdx4wsGHT_6SQ,4,2,2,3,"Edited:: the restaurant has since clarified a specific takeout menu on their website that includes all that we received for our meal. We look forward to sampling the rest of the menu when we can dine in again, or perhaps on the cute porch in front!

As a huge fan of the former Porch & Proper, I was very excited to learn that a Lebanese restaurant had taken over the space once held by such a glorious byo. The cultural influences here would offer some flavor profiles not found anywhere else in town. Friday we decided to check it out. 

Let me begin by saying that the food here IS flavorful and is quite delicious. I look forward to the day when I can dine here and sample the menu in the space it is meant to be savored in. The meat was all cooked to perfection (I liked the chicken, my partner enjoyed the lamb), the potatoes were flavorful, the pita was fresh, and the dessert was delish. I have zero complaints  about the quality of the food we tried.  

I'm not sure if my less than ideal experience comes from a communication issue on my part or a lack of transparency on the website. I am not yet comfortable with indoor dining and was excited to see that they offer their Taste of Lebanon ($40 pp) menu for takeout. I love ALL the mezze, so the tasting menu seemed perfect. My best friend told me earlier in the day that he had tried the tasting menu as takeout and said it was delightful. I was pumped to try it. When I called to place my order the young man that took my call had me immediately give him my credit card info which kind of rubbed me the wrong way. I've never had that experience when placing an order over the phone; don't you want to know what my order is before you take my card info?  Luckily it sounded kind of like a restaurant in the background, so I wasn't completely freaked, but it was uncomfortable. I told him that we wanted the taste of Lebanon for two guests and he just told me that it would be ready in 30 minutes. This also confused me because I hadn't told him which specialties we wanted for our entrees. When asked, he said that it was the chef's choice and they were offering the mixed grill entree for the day. I don't necessarily have a problem with this, but I didn't see anywhere on the website where it said that you don't get to choose which specialty you get with the tasting menu (I don't like red meat and was hoping for some chicken shawarma, but the grilled chicken from the mixed grill was moist and yummy). Still, this wasn't my biggest concern. As noted, I came for the mezze that was offered by the tasting menu. Sadly, we only received potatoes and hummus. No labneh, no baba ganoush, nothing else. Just hummus and potatoes, perhaps the only two mezze I could have made somewhat decent for myself. I had been looking forward to this all week, so I'm disappointed with what I received. Again, I can understand if the tasting menu for takeout is different, or if not all the cold mezze is included with it, but I think it should be noted more clearly on the website.

Our experience was a little disappointing, but it was not the food that disappointed us. Both my partner and I said that we would certainly go here for a date night once date nights are a thing again.",2021-01-24 04:06:20,684,3231,

When I got there, I spoke with the groomer and showed her a picture of what I wanted my puppy to look like. I wanted a half of inch off of his coat. I showed her a picture to make sure she understood. The owner told me I t usually takes 3-4 hours. I left to run errands. After about 4 and a half hours, I called to check on my pup. The owner told me they were finishing up and I could head that way. He told me they send pictures to the owners and he would send one shortly. Since I was on the other side of town, I asked my mom to go get him for me. I received the picture of my pup about 5 minutes after speaking with the owner. I was mortified! He looked nothing like the picture I showed the groomer. I immediately called back to the salon and told them I was very unhappy with the cut. He told me to wait until I see my pup in person as pictures sometimes don't do justice. My mom FaceTime me once she got there and she was herself was mortified. She said he was extremely uneven. He had patch spots of hair all over. They didn't trim around his ears at all. The went extremely low on his body. I spoke with the owner over FaceTime as my mom was there and explained that I wasn't satisfied and that's not the cut I asked for. The groomer said she was going to  leave a half of inch of hair. But I specifically asked for a half of inch off. That's also why I showed her the picture of what I wanted so there wouldn't be any confusion. I truly believe the owner did not handle the situation well. He was only focused on me paying for the service. He didn't care that I was unhappy and that his groomer didn't do what I asked. He literally argued with me about my puppy's haircut and what I wanted. I would never recommend this place. Look up professional, reputable companies.

It's Saturday night and we're celebrating my brothers birthday and we decided to go to finally check out this spot. 

Sidenote: when they opened up a while back i was so excited and happy to hear there's a black owned restaurant/club in Ybor city right on the strip! So I've been wanting to come here for a minute to support my people and see how nice the place was because I've heard nothing but great things about it.

Okay after a 30 minute drive from Clearwater we get to 7th avenue and it's Poppin  we approach the door and they have a two man system going. One checking ID and the other searching which is cool. The guy who is doing the searching was by far the rudest and disrespectful doorman I've ever encountered that says a lot coming from me who has been to clubs across the country. He was barking demands at a group of beautiful young women who were in front of us in line. The ladies stood up for themselves as they should've and his reply "" I'm just doing my job"" no mu**-+%#$a being rude and obnoxious isn't in your job description. Now let's pause here, 100% of any nightclub want and need beautiful women in their spot why you ask?? If the place is filled with good looking women there will and should be plenty of men there trying impress those women by buying bottles and drinks for them. When i saw those women being disrespected i knew this place has a problem 
 We get to the young man who was holding the line and we began to express how we feel about the other doorman and he gives the most ignorant response I've heard in years!!!? We said "" damn your coworker over being rude to everyone that's not a good look"" he replies with "" well you know how they do us we're the only black owned business on the strip""  
What?!?!? The hell are you talking about?! Being black owned has absolutely nothing to do with rudeness and disrespect. We tell him we're here to support our people we drove 30mins to support not be pissed on. Then the other door man runs up on us and says ""is there a problem over here""  as if he was DeeBo or something smh at this point it's unbelievable and this is when you start to ask yourself ""do i want to give these folks my hard earned money?"" ""Why should i give them my money?"" The manger at the door walks up to my brother and she yells ""aye i heard him tell you to take off your hoodie,now take it off!!!"" I'm like naaw champ I'm not going in this raggedy muthafucka fuck that!! I eventually went in with my brother because it was his birthday,my other brother choose not to and just walked the strip. 

In closing i could give me opinion of what i thought about the vibe once inside but naw there's no praise going to be given today. Those three at the door was a terrible combo they all should be sent to do a 40hour customer service training to give them the tools needed to preform their job because that was piss poor. No one should be treated the way we were and that group of beautiful young ladies. Sad to say I'll never step inside this place again and that hurt me big tyme",2021-01-29 12:42:30,689,3169,

Some good,  some bad;  this location provided an unwelcome first,  however.  I had been there for 4-5 weeks,  renting by the week,  paying on time,  and generally going to work and minding my own business.  Yesterday,  Saturday the 2nd,  I wen to the office to roll over my room again,  only to be told I could not be extended.  I had been put on a do not rent list.  I asked why and was told the manager had seen ""multiple unregistered persons in and out"" of my room,  as if I was dealing drugs or something else undesirable.  This was completely false;  the only person in my room beside myself was another worker on this jobsite who was staying at the motel.   A registered guest.  I had no way to prove it and was forced to relocate abruptly.  The irony of it all is I had seen a couple of rooms of people who were clearly up to something (when you've been there you always know what to look for).  More than once I saw them up and about when I left early for work,  though they obviously weren't heading to any job of their own.  The only conclusion I can draw from this is the Virginia/Plumb Motel 6 would rather rent to drug dealers or at the least addicts,  with all the sideshow bs they bring with them,  than a guy who goes to work every day and doesn't cause ANY problems.

So this time while driving through Nashville I was bound and determined to get some Hot Chicken, but on a road trip you never want to waste too much time getting too far from the highway... que BJ Hot Chicken. Tucked in right at the crossways of I-40, I-24, and I-440 it allowed us to get off the highway eat and get right back on in minimal time.  The surrounding area seems a little rough and the parking lot is steep and a little awkward, but it couldn't be easier getting on and off the highway with multiple highways I could connect to.   
Now for the chicken... the selection is somewhat limited.  Of course they have chicken, chicken strips, and wings.  Their chicken sandwich is just a couple strips on a bun.   I had the winglets and picked medium heat... I thought the texture was great.  They were fried really well.  And the he sauce/paste (what should I call it) had great flavor and I like how you know it is there but it isn't too greasy or too saucy.  I dipped some of my winglets in Ranch, but they were great plain too. Also note, even when I was on my last wing and finishing up my wife's chicken strip sandwich there was still steam coming from the chicken after biting into it.  That's impressive!  Coleslaw had almost a sweet flavor.  Was somewhere in between a creamy coleslaw like KFC and a thinner vinegar coleslaw. TIP: the sandwich has coleslaw on the sandwich, so try another side as your side, we didn't know that prior to ordering.

3 chicken marooshes
2 beef cheesesteaks
1 order of fries
1 order of wings (5 wings)

What did we get:
2 chicken marooshes
3 beef cheesesteaks
2 order of fries

So you see the problem, right? So to rectify that mistake, I ordered again. This time, I ordered 2 chicken marooshes and 1 order of wings (5 wings). But I called a couple of minutes later to cancel the marooshes. I waited an hour to receive the order. I went to go pick it up. I gave Salaam and said my name and order (wings). The owner asked, ""Are you sure it was just wings? Because we have 2 marooshes as well."" I told them that I cancelled and he asked me why didn't the lady have it marked as cancelled. I don't know why, ask the lady. Instead of taking accountability, he told me with an attitude, ""Please don't do that, okay? We're really busy!!!"" Whoa! Still keeping my cool, I said, ""Yeah, the first order was messed up too. That's why I'm here again. Is that my fault?"" Then he says, ""Yeah, well we're busy...."" As I'm leaving, I turned to leave the way I entered . Other customers kindly pointed out the exit, so I turned to exit. Then he fires back with a snarky attitude, ""Learn to read the signs!!"" Seriously? First we waited two and a half hours for both orders,  you mess up, then instead of taking accountability for both mistakes, you blame shift, and now this abrasive comment??? I understand the busy part. This isn't my first time ordering from a ""busy"" place. But was the callous attitude necessary? This attitude has nothing to do with busy. I've worked in customer service and I've had people who were rude to me. But I never retorted back. If circumstances determine your attitude, then maybe you're not a nice person to begin with.

Also, I went with two other people. They were planning to stay outside but then the lady guarding the door let them in. Then she told them to wait outside. What was even the point?

All in all, the food is mediocre and overpriced. Not to mention, they're taking advantage of the pandemic. For example, the cheesesteak was $8.50 and during the pandemic, they hiked it up to $11. I felt bad for my uncle who spent over $90+ on bland food and bad customer service when all he wanted to do was treat me after not seeing me for almost a year because of the pandemic!

The green and white glazed terra cotta is stunning. They did a great job keeping the Coca-Coca signs and what you would think it might've looked like many years ago! The lights strung across to the Bottleworks Hotel to The Garage makes it even more magical looking!

There seemed to be a couple different entrances and a parking lot along with metered parking. It was fairly easy to find a spot and the walk was close and lit up well. Lots of people coming and going. If you see the big HOTEL sign for the Bottleworks Hotel then The Garage is to your left. Walk down the brick street lit up with string lights - Carrollton Avenue and it's about halfway down the street you will see entrances to The Garage.

we were excited to add this restaurant to our list of favs, but unfortunately, it was scratched off of that list after our experience tonight. 
i can get into how wonderful the food was, all the courses we enjoyed; the breaded oysters & calamari with coconut cream, the arugula salad or the beet salad with burrata....the duck breast with canaloni & mushrooms, the snaper with cabbage....not to mention the wonderful cocktails. that ALL was sidestepped by the mediocrity of the service......
i mentioned to my dining partner, upon being sat, that the waiter almost seems like he doesn't want to be here...i guess that was a foreshadowing of what was to come. 
HE NEVER TOLD US ABOUT ANY SPECIALS, NEVER OFFERED US THE AMUSE-BOUCHE, NEVER ASKED US HOW EACH COURSE WAS, beyond stating upon clearing the plates, OH LOOKS LIKE YOU LIKED THAT. i needed new silverware as mine were all sticky for some reason, had to poach them off of a nearby table......
the ONLY reason i found out about the specials was because the waiter/bartender that was taking care of the table next to us brought out a tomato soup amuse-bouche to his customers (the woman wanted to order a bowl of it and their waiter stated that it was just to tease them a bit before dinner), proceeded to tell them about the specials, 2 appetizers and i think 2 entrees....we had already ordered at this point and i would have ordered the veal special.
it seemed like out server was more content in hanging out at the front desk, MAYBE strolling through, but not interested enough to care about our progress or if we needed anything until after we finished dinner.....
it's a shame that this restaurant will not get our business again but for a lack luster server......in the current climate of the world, can a restaurant really afford to lose patrons? this place was NOT busy at all.....
too many other restaurants, nearby, that also have great food, but ALSO have great service to boot.  
i love to reward great service, but not when it's blatanly undeserving....
WE CAN NOT, IN GOOD CONSCIENCE RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT.....",2021-01-15 02:16:53,435,2191,

We were able to sit right away and the staff were all really friendly. We told them it was our first visit. An older man, whom I suspected was the owner, came out of the kitchen and explained the menu to us. All staff wore masks, but he got super close to me, which I wasn't comfortable with, but I didn't have the heart to ask him to give me some distance because he was just so nice. He sent us egg rolls and crab puffs on the house, which was a really nice gesture. (Especially because my hubby wanted some egg rolls, which aren't included with AYCE.)

It is nice that almost all of their specialty rolls are included in the AYCE. I ordered spicy tuna, Kaun, and Nan Madol rolls. They were okay-tasting, but the fish didn't seem as fresh as I might have liked. Many of their rolls have a sweet sauce on them, which I thought might be like eel sauce, but was more of a sugary-honey flavor that I didn't like. We got a lot of food for the price, but it seems the quality is not quite there, which is important when you're eating raw fish. My hubby also got a Vegas roll that was cold. That is tempura-fried so it should have been hot, which leads me to believe it was premade, or some elements of it were.

I'm sad to give them two stars, as the staff and owner were really so nice, but the sushi is not great, so we wouldn't come back. The prices are pretty decent for AYCE, but sushi should probably be quality over quantity. Not to mention, I get the impression the establishment isn't the cleanest.",2021-01-17 18:30:42,377,1680,

I had originally planned to buy the materials elsewhere & just have Chris Grant do the installation. However, they offer a discount if you also purchase the floor from them, so I went in to see what they have. Since they only stock high-quality floors that they stand by, I chose one with a little help & they installed it without problem. Impeccable customer service throughout. Amazingly nice crew. However, as soon as they left, my family and I noticed that the floor we'd chosen was popping and crackling. Chris came over to look at it, and he immediately said, ""I wouldn't want to live with this floor, so I wouldn't expect you to, either."" PEOPLE, they replaced the floor ON THEIR OWN DIME. If I had purchased the floor elsewhere, I would've been stuck in an endless loop of ""it was installed wrong"" from the manufacturer and ""no, the floor is faulty"" from the installer. But when The Floor Store & More says they stand by their products, THEY MEAN IT.

But wait, I'm not done. When they came back to install floor #2 (one that I chose and like even better than the first), they went OUT OF THEIR WAY to make sure the baseboards remained pristine and that we still had a livable space each evening when they left. (We could still cook and eat in the kitchen each night & even sit and watch TV on the couch.) It took them longer than it would have if they'd just ripped it all out in a single day, but they truly treat each home as if it's their own and took the time and care to do it as perfectly as they could. (We have a largish family--six people--so this kind of courtesy made going through the installation a second time so much easier on us.)

The quote I got from The Floor Store & More was not the lowest, but in the long run I saved thousands (not to mention my sanity) by going with them. BTW, they're also the only business I came across that will install, caulk, and paint your baseboards if you want them to. 

Please check out this company; it's rare to find such amazing customer service. Even more amazing to find a company that 100% stands by their products & services, even if it means they lose money on a job.",2021-01-14 00:25:29,501,2293,

Customer service was top notch and the restaurant is nice inside with plenty of seating and good music playing. 

Sadly, I wish we had better things to say about our food. I have to agree with other reviewers of recent - the biggest miss to the whole ordeal HAS to be that pretty much everything is missing SEASONING. To be fair, this was our first time in. We've wanted to go for a while and just haven't been able to make it by since they are primarily and lunch spot and both of us have jobs in downtown Nashville during the day. COVID and work-from-home provided us an opportunity to go, so we ran by for lunch.

We ordered a daily special goat cheese and bacon sandwich and a Reuben since so many people were recommending it, along with a bowl of their cheesy ham and potato soup. Let me start with what was good - the bacon on my wife's sandwich and the bread itself. The bread has a super tasty, buttery crunch and delicious flavor. The bacon was crisped up nice and had a great bite to it.

Everything else was a superb let-down. Honestly, I have to ask - what is everyone's fascination with their house-made chips? Those dudes were awful! It was literally just a plain, sliced potato with NO SEASONING. They had a nice crisp to them, so it wasn't the cooking method, they just had no FLAVOR at all. Not even a dash of salt or pepper. Secondly, my Reuben was a travesty. Barely any flakes of meat, hardly any 1000 island, and 90% sauerkraut. If it wasn't for how good the bread was, I wouldn't have eaten as much of it as I did. Afterwards, I regretted it. Honestly, it was just awful. My wife's sandwich, despite the good bread and bacon, was equally disappointing. Too much cream cheese overpowered the sandwich and again, despite the bacon, had little to no flavor. The soup was also just as bad. It was packed with HUGE chunks of potato and ham - I get that some people like their soups, salsas and other various dishes served in bowls to be exxxxtra chunky, but these weren't good at all. Sadly, the huge chunks of potato had not cooked thoroughly and most had that kind of undercooked hard texture like when you don't leave baked potatoes in the oven long enough to bake all the way through. The soup itself was supremely watery and not like what I was expecting - a thick, cheesy, soft potato-y bowl of goodness. It wasn't even hot.

Too many strikes and too much lack of flavor brings this to a spot we will likely not go to again. Sadly, there aren't many other options locally for a good sandwich shop. They are trying, I'll give them that - and they have a great work ethic and attitude, but the food taste just isn't there.",2021-01-12 18:47:29,587,2756,
ZXUrIn9WiuMDCxsTvm35Dw,ipsUqDOegEQyU1R5oNJMTQ,dBOVfp8Ub8uO9qUPtw92_w,5,2,0,1,"Lilette is my favorite French restaurant in New Orleans. We first came for my birthday, and my boyfriend loved it so much that we went again for his birthday! 

I want to start off by complimenting the Aviation I had. Many places I go to don't make Aviations because they may not have Creme de Violette or Maraschino Liqueur on hand, or sometimes I order it and it leaves me disappointed. However, at Lilette I had the best Aviation EVER. It was perfect and didn't leave a strong after taste after drinking it. I always treat myself to an Aviation at Lilette because I know it will always be made right. 

The appetizers we tried the first time was the escargot and the potato gnocchi. The gnocchi was delightfully creamy and decadent. The escargot was amazing as well with a nice texture served on toasted bread. The second time we had a tuna ceviche and oysters from California. Both appetizers were super fresh and tasty. 

For my birthday I ordered the NY Strip with a bacon, butter, and sage rub with duck fat fries on the side. This was one of the best steaks I've ever had. It was a very large steak, and I didn't expect to finish it. It was truly outstanding. Notice how I don't have a picture of it on this review...after the first bite I couldn't bother to stop and take a picture. My boyfriend ordered the lamb shoulder which was also delicious. However, I thought my strip was better :) 

For dessert we shared the limoncello cheesecake - it was amazing.

If you are craving great cocktails, an outstanding steak, authentic French food, Lilette will have you covered.",2021-01-03 20:28:25,323,1579,

The service is friendly and proper. The ambiance is sophisticated yet approachable. This place is a must for visitors and locals alike!

Where to start? The booze of course! I ended up having a fun morning with three different drinks. First I started out with their Wedding Beer. This was served in a chilled mug that was fit for toasting with others. The beer was fresh with a well-balanced profile that had a welcoming character. 

Next, I got the Fresh from Florida Mojito. Beautifully presented with mashed mint and oranges that screamed vacation. It made me more than ready for Florida sun and good times to come.

My appetizer came next. I went with the Native Chili based on the unique selection of Florida meats such as alligator, duck, venison, and boar. Let me tell you, all this game and it was not overwhelming or too wild. Everything melded together beautifully with a slight sweetness from the cranberries beans. The crunch from the chips was perfect too.

Then the main course! I was tempted to go with seafood, but I was really feeling steak and went with the 8 oz Flank Steak. I was more than pleased! It was skillfully cooked with the right portions of mashed potatoes and crunchy green beans. The chimmichurri sauce was phenomenal as well! Avocado and citrus brightness made each bite of the steak mesmerizing. The random addition of popcorn was playful and I enjoyed it. Don't take everything so seriously--just like Florida.

I had to finish off with my last drink and dessert. I went with their Ulele Spring Hard Seltzer and Coconut Ice Cream. Perfect combo because the seltzer was almost like a palatte cleanser and complemented the Coconut Ice Cream as well by bringing a bubbly clean take between the creaminess of the ice cream. The Coconut Ice Cream was gorgeous and velvety. It was also served in a coconut shell. Presentation on point! 

Overall, one of the best meals I have ever had! Ulele is a sparkling gem amongst Florida cuisine and is worth eating at. High regards to this place for sure!!",2021-01-24 16:12:26,420,2133,

We had a reservation for an early evening, Saturday dinner; party of six. We waited at the entrance without a greeting while watching the two, maybe three employees run around.

We were sat without anything on the table, had to flag down the waitress to show us the QC code on the table without giving direction as to how to pull up the menus from that point (we had two aged members and a youngling with us, but still had complications pulling it up on everyone's phone without proper directions). The descriptions of the different food selections were mostly accurate with a few ingredients left out and after over an hour of waiting for our food, did we see the extra ingredients added on top that could have been easily requested to be left out due to allergies.

Everything had to be flagged down and asked for...no placesettings were at the table when 2 of the 4 appetizers were brought out maybe 30ish minutes later...and the rest of the appetizers came with the entrees. It took us the whole meal to get ice for 2 drinks because the water brought out to the table were in self serving glasses that you had to pour into your own iceless cup. The waitress kept skipping me when taking drink and food orders.

The only reason why one star  was awarded was because you can't go lower...the taste of the food was amazing, but not enough to top the scales in their favor. Waiting over an hour for Ramen and some sliders is completely ridiculous esp when the restaurant was less than half full. 

We came with great expectations as it was a surprise to one of our guests because he loves watching Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives with Guy; I am curious how he would rate this if he were to show up, again...",2021-01-13 17:52:36,373,1856,

It pains me to write a bad review about a local business but I simply must as the service was absolutely terrible.

I first tried Goodness in October and had a rather neutral experience - while the patio was not shaded and it was rather hot, the food was overall good (although I would agree with other reviews that the açaí bowl was too runny). 

I then went back this past week with my family and left rather in shock as to how our experience unfolded. I will summarize with this statement: be prepared to work for yourself. 

1- Do not expect the tables to be clean. And when they are not, you may surprised at the response when you ask for them to be wiped down. We started at a table with jelly and crumbs all over it and moved. The new table had such a dirty film on it, it was clear they hadn't been wiped in awhile. The employee said they cleaned them each morning and they're just stained and not dirty.  IRONICALLY he stated this as he lifted the white rag and it was black from where he wiped it. Yeah, don't try to back out of being caught in a job not done; clearly the tables where not cleaned that morning as we showed up 10 minutes after it opened. Just own it, apologize and move on. It's your job at ANY time in history to wipe tables. And especially during COVID. 

2- Don't expect to get cream, sugar, utensils or anything of that sort with your food. Instead, be prepared to go in not once, not twice, but 3-5 times to ask for these things as you discover you need them. And then be prepared to have the employee get clearly annoyed at... wait for it... having to do his job.
We went back in and asked for cream and sugar, painfully he got it. We went back in and asked for a stir stick, he grabbed with bare hand in the middle of it (a napkin is what is commonly used to grab those; even in non COVID times).
We went back in and asked for a booster seat- nope, don't have them- sorry. ""We used to but got rid of them.""
We needed a bit more cream- he was clearly annoyed. 

To feel GUILTY as a customer for then needing a fork for my child to eat his food and not wanting to go in and ask, well, that's bad. 

3- The REDEMPTION is that the food is great. Reasonably priced, good quality. Good stuff. 

In summary- so much focus is put on the customer supporting small businesses during this time. And I agree we should; as is proven by how we spend our money. But know that when you are an EMPLOYEE of a small business, you represent that business. Do it well. You're paid for more than a transaction. Say hello when a customer enters (oh that didn't happen either). Anticipate what a customer will need and if you don't know, ask them at the table. Smile. If you make a mistake (like failing to wipe tables before opening), own it and do it with no excuses (because when you lie and say it was done as you heap black grime on your cloth where our child is eating it looks lame). And for heavens sake, don't look annoyed when the customer NICELY comes in for the 4th time to ask for something needed and basically is doing your job.

I give it two stars because the food is food.

4 stars for food. 
No stars for service. 
2 stars is the median.",2021-01-02 20:32:44,738,3336,

I've been about 10 times now with my friend and it never disappoints! I've never had the regular sushi or ramen from here, so this review is only for the sushi burrito.

First of all, I know a lot of people complain about how confusing this place is. Since I've never eaten in the back, I always know how to do the line. You go in line and kind of like Chipotle, you customize your burrito! I always get a burrito with white rice, spicy tuna/salmon, sesame seeds, eel sauce, cucumber, seaweed salad, avocado, and tempura crunch! It's basic but I don't like it over veggied. I believe the seaweed salad and the avocado are extra money, but to me it's always worth it!

Two small complaints about this place I could think of. 1, last time my boyfriend and I came he wanted to get tempura chicken as his protein and they had none! We didn't see it on the counter and the labeled tray was empty. Unfortunately, he doesn't like seafood too much so he didn't enjoy his burrito. But, we're definitely going to try again because I am not letting him dislike this place!! 2, sometimes the staff seems very confused. I've gotten great staff that are super quick with it and know what they are doing. However, sometimes you get someone and it seems like it's their first day. They take their time with it, which can be agonizing when you're hungry!! Either way, these are not reasons to turn down awesome food!!

Now, among the many options they have in the food hall this restaurant caught my attention since they not only filled the spot for a pizza place but added a twist with it's Peruvian cuisine.

Why am I giving them the first review and not to other restaurants next to them? Well, when I was browsing the hall I saw many delicious things to pick from and I almost went to try another thing but since I was not starving I decided to go through the place first and this restaurant is located at the very end of the south wing and I know a lot of people maybe just on a short time to grab a bite so lookout for this place before making a quick choice.

Now, for the traditional customers they offer regular pizza choices like pepperoni, meat lovers, bbq chicken, deluxe or blanca; but aside from these options they had meat stuffed pizza or a create your own pizza where you can pick from these other ingredients: bacon, olives, pineapple, banana pepper, feta, mushrooms, steak, shrimp, arugula, spinach, burrata, pesto, etc.

A slice of a normal one was 3.75, the gourmet ones 4.50 and meat stuffed 6.00.

They also have breadsticks with cheese or pepperoni where you can pick a full order of 4 or go for half order.

I hope this doesn't discourage people but they only sell soft drinks.

So far it seems like a regular place and anyone can go to the regular pizza place on mass but they also have calzones for 8.50 the regular ones (veggie, panzerotti or stromboli) but the taste of the house comes with the TWIST ones which are: Lomo Saltado (Steak cooked with red onions tomato and soy sauce). Ají de Gallina (Peruvian Chicken stew, cooked with yellow ají pepper, garlic, onion and shredded chicken) and Empanadazo (Mixed greens, fresh mozzarella, cherry tomato and pesto sauce) these TWIST options are 10.00.

I tried the Lomo Saltado which was really tasty and I picked ají for my sauce to the side but since they were still making them I had a slice of meat lovers pizza which I really enjoyed.

Based on what friends and neighbors told us several of the units (in that brand new complex where we used to live) had a/c issues as well as other issues. 
We also love how quiet & peaceful it is here at Camden Preserve.  No tankers or trains going by here. 
We also love how well maintained the grounds of the complex are kept. The pond, fountain and the kayak launch on the bay are lovely. There are several benches located throughout the complex so you can sit in the sun and relax on a beautiful day.

I've visited this Starbucks several, many, beaucoup times before and I'm not sure how I didn't write a review, but here goes nothing...

Just to save time, I ordered ahead, using the app, I love this order ahead feature... I love, love, love this feature. I was using it before Covid-19. I love it, I  really, really do; do you think I love it? You're right, I do. 

I ordered a Venti green tea Matcha Frappuccino with coconut milk please, because your girl is lactose intolerant, but I still wanna get my matcha on, so there you have it coconut milk it is. I don't like that they up charge you $.60 for coconut milk, I mean don't charge me because I have a genetic in-deficiency, hello. At any rate...

I entered the facility and per City of NOLA Covid regulations, I had my mask on. I walked to the counter to pick up my drink, they verified me, I picked up my drink & I proceeded to leave. 

The barista's hold the drinks behind the counter because I believe there's been some issues with folks doing a 'snatch & grab' of drinks they didn't order or pay for. It's all good for me, no hassle that just reassures me that my drink is super fresh and hasn't been tampered with; DON'T SLIP ME NO MICKIE'S. 

I tipped them on the app on my way out the door. I was happy, I received super fast service, the baristas were polite, they greeted me as I entered & asked if I wanted a straw: CLASSIC STARBUCKS BEHAVIOR. 

Annnnnndddddd my drink tasted exactly as it should, coconut milk and all... I was very pleased about this because I ordered a Venti so there was lots of DRINK to be DRUNK.

I had read the menu last year at this time and really wanted to go try it and never got to it. They have been in that location for 10 years. When I got there I was a little unsure of where to park so I asked when I got in the building and they said yes anywhere there around the restaurant it's fine there's no restricted parking. 
The hostess took me back to the ""sip"" booth and I was nice and cosy back there and I could see everything that was going on in the restaurant. I called in advance and they did recommend reservations.

My mom was supposed to come with me but she woke up with a migraine that morning so it kind of blew our plans to try the Nosh and the Savor value menu and just split them so I opted for the Savor and added the two items that I really really wanted to try off of Nosh. I added the corn creme brulee and did deviled eggs to my Savor option. I also decided to start my dinner with a Pear Rita with a red sea salt rim on the glass. It was a pretty good cocktail.

The waitress brought out my deviled eggs and corn creme brulee with my appetizer portion of Savor which was the blue tortilla chips and the avocado verde. The corn creme brulee was surprisingly very good adding that crispy sugary topping to a creamed corn I would have never thought of that! The deviled eggs with the Wasabi on top really packed a punch and we're quite good. The avocado verde was okay but didn't have a lot of flavor. Then next came the main portions which they said was served on a slate board but it was actually a plastic board that was black to resemble slate.

I liked everything but what I loved were the brussel sprouts with the pine nuts and roasted-garlic, the bruleed Brie with the black Mission fig Jam, apples, agave and a pretzel crostini. Those two items alone are worth coming back for.

On to dessert. I ordered a spiked coffee that had chocolate cups with white chocolate Godiva liqueur on the side. So many times I have got coffee in a restaurant where the coffee was just lukewarm and this was not. My coffee was hot so that when I dropped that the Godiva filled chocolate in it it dissolved and made for an awesome cup of coffee. The dessert was a vanilla bean creme brulee with strawberries on the side and a dark chocolate truffle with peanut butter glaze and Godiva liqueur. The crust on the creme brulee was perfect and as I cracked through it I could see this was going to be a good dessert.

I was able to leave enough bits of things for the hubby to try everything except for the creme brulee and the whipped feta because I ate them :) I took those items in a to go bag and he said he liked everything and his favorite was the bruleed brie.

After receiving my order and getting into my car. I took a bit of the Strawberry and Banana crepe and it was HORRIBLE, it was ice cold. It wasn't cold because of the fruit and cream, it was as if the crepes was sitting there for a while. It was hard, difficult to chew and just nasty. I ended up eating the fruit and cream on the inside and threw the crepe in the trash. So because I wasted almost $16 on two cold and hard crepes, I am giving this place 2 stars. 
Also, there was barely any fruit on the inside. The middle of the crepe was just cream and NOTHING else. $16 for a few slices of fruit and a cold hard crepe was not worth it. A WASTE of money!!!! 

I understand that during COVID you may not have many customers, but at this point the crepes should be made to order.
I could understand if your business is jam packed with costumes and someone is making a large batch of crepes to keep up with the customers, but in this case the crepes would most likely still be warm when served. 
But....I was the only one in the store. You at-least should be able to serve a quality product to ONE customer. 
So no, I do not recommend this place. It's plenty of better places in Chinatown to get pastries from. I will not be going back to this place ever again.",2021-01-26 01:57:27,404,1873,

Many years ago, I had been diagnosed with scoliosis and I suffer from persistent low back and neck pain. To make things worse, I am an operating room nurse who has to lift heavy objects and patients, while being on my feet for long hours at a time.

Thanks to Yelp and my massage therapist's recommendation, I came across Dr. Kori. I conveniently made a new patient appointment/assessment online on his website and visited his downtown office on the fifth floor of the Balboa building (one door south of Banana Republic off State Street). Dr. Kori listened attentively to my questions and concerns (though he's a soft spoken guy in general), went over how chiropractic care can improve one's life (including what subluxations are), and lastly his payment options WITHOUT an awkward sales pitch. Unlike other chiropractors I have visited in the past, Dr. Kori remains very reasonable and truly believes that everyone should have access to spinal care and prevention. For that reason, he offers various affordable payment options including: pay-per-visit, pre-pay 'X' number of visits a month, pre-paid two adjustments per month package, and prepaid unlimited monthly visits. Not to mention, there are discounts for students, seniors and families. He has walk-in hours for patients which are flexible and don't require an appointment for a brief adjustment. 

Keep in mind, Dr. Kori is closed on Fridays and weekends, but you can always call to book an appointment if you're in need. Wellness Wednesdays are also a great option for those not wanting to commit with $40 visits for non-membership patients.

I would highly recommend Dr. Kori for his demeanor, listening skills, and chiropractic skills. My headaches/migraines that lingered have gone away for the time being thanks to him!",2021-01-25 19:40:35,356,1892,

Rebecca did my hair and when she was done I had the worst nightmare of my life. Not only is my hair yellow and orange with white streaks, all of my foils bled and I have zigzags all over my head with black roots and yellow hair. She obviously knew she did a horrible job because she kept talking about what she would do different once she got to know my hair it wasn't until I got in the chair and she started to blow dry before I noticed the nightmare. I left the salon after paying $150 panicking . the next day I went to two salons to get a consultation. I also contacted my hairstylist from Connecticut that I went to when I lived there and she could not believe what she saw as well all of them saying this is the worst job they have ever seen in their careers. This is going to cost me hundreds to fix. I decided to go back to the salon to rectify this issue. The manager said to me that this is what I asked for and that if I would have gotten a root touchup this would've all been fixed. Not even acknowledging the horrible bleeds everywhere, the color of my hair and the fact that she didn't even grab one piece of my root with the foils. My other hairdresser never did a root touchup for me she did heavy foils in the front around the crown and I always achieved a beautiful blonde blend all the way to the root. Not only would they not refund my money Or knowledge the horrific nightmare that my hair looked like, they offered to fix it and charge me for it but only for low lights. This is by far the most incompetent disgusting and unprofessional establishment that I have ever encountered. Do not go there for anything. I should have read the reviews before I went which is my fault. Two of the salon hairstylist did not have a mask on and a couple of them had their mask down to their mouth with their nose out. Run as fast as you can go somewhere else. I am not one to ever leave reviews but I felt compelled to do this as you should not ever go through what I went through as now I will be paying a lot of money to fix what they screwed up shame on them",2021-01-02 22:50:52,446,2125,

This place was by far the best. The Sonoran hot dog is high quality and juicy and the toppings are varied and unique. It was one of the best hot dogs I've ever had! So much so that we went back a week later on our way back home to CA. This time we ordered the other hot dogs (Shanghai, Mexicana, Chile Relleno, and Elotero). The Shanghai was refreshing as the cole slaw and cucumbers were a nice balance to the meatiness of the hot dog. I thought there was a lily of Umami flavor in this dog, so it was one of my favorites! 
The Elotero uses fresh corn, and though I thought I'd like it the best, I found it too creamy for my taste. Besides the Sonoran dog, my favorite was the Chile Relleno. The hatch chiles are so well cooked and smoky, not hot at all. In fact, I thought the hatch chiles on the Chile Relleno dog were the best cooked out of all the New Mexican restaurants we tried. Definitely get the Sonoran dog, the Chile Relleno dog, and the Shanghai dog. I thought the Mexicana had about the same taste as a normal chili dog, so I'd pass on that one. 

To make a long story short, I will be returning here if I'm ever in the state of Arizona because their hot dogs  are just that good. The hot dog game is elevated at Black Top Grill!",2021-01-31 20:47:28,301,1368,

As Charlie Brown's sister Sally famously said when she skipped Halloween and accompanied Linus to the Pumpkin Patch on that ill-fated eve to meet the Great Pumpkin and be showered with gifts:

I was robbed! I spent the whole night waiting for the Great Pumpkin when I could have been out for tricks or treats!

So, too, did I feel today upon receiving my $26 chicken Pho from BT to GO!!!!! ($17 for the Pho, plus delivery, plus tip...).  Before I go into the details, let me assure you of 2 things:  I have had a LOT of Pho all over the world but specifically here in the Tampa Bay.

Let's start with the good: ordering via UberEats was super easy.  From the time I place the order to delivery was around 40 minutes - pretty impressive!   The quantity was large.

Ok, now let's get real, folks.  First, upon opening the bag, I was surprised to see that there was no bowl, per se (see photo).  Broth in a high-topped container (chicken in same broth).  Noddle packed into a smaller container- and I mean PACKED to the top.  I could not pour the broth and chicken over the noodles - no room - and adding the noodles to the high-topped container?  First, awkward to eat and second, really - no room.  A fairly thoughtless preparation.  Fortunately, I was at work and found a tupperware bowl in the breakroom...there it is.

Ok, now to the Pho.  It was BLAND!  Very few herbs.  2 leaves (yes 2!!!) of basil.  Chicken was tough - way overcooked.  It came with a small, 1 oz container of Hoisin - gratis.  Sriracha was $.55 - really???  I did not get it was the meal was already $$ and I thought I had some at work...alas, I did not...

I  could have paid HALF for better Pho 3 blocks away - and that I shall do in the future.",2021-01-22 21:35:19,421,1847,

They are constantly out of stock of what we want and several times lately our items are missing parts or we even found them damaged when we got home. I needed to return a chair and they wouldn't take it back because the bar code had been pulled off (it was still brand new, no damage, and had been way less than their 365 day policy.) Maybe we just got someone new who was difficult/tough, because this has never been a problem for us before? But from now on we won't touch the bar codes, even if we have a receipt, just to be on the safe side. 

Anyways. Another issue is that during Covid, a few employees weren't wearing their masks properly (not over the nose) and did NOT stay 5-6 feet apart. We had to keep backing up and asking them to respect our ""zone"" because they were trying to stand super close.

We are in the process of building a new storage room and it has taken us over 6 TRIPS to get the parts we need for the cabinets/drawers, and we still aren't done because the store never has what we need in stock and they won't hold items for over a day. So as soon as something gets in (after constantly checking for updates because the email update system doesn't work) you have to stop everything and race to the store. It's extremely frustrating and difficult. 

So far I think I'd give them 1 star based on this location's poor function, but will keep it at 3 because I still somewhat like their products. All I know is that the idea of making yet another trip to IKEA just depresses the heck out of me, I hope to be done soon.",2021-01-25 22:36:52,354,1655,

The dining area looked unique with its modern closed booths, dark lighting, and Chinese accented decorations. This restaurant offers a somewhat modern take on classic Chinese dishes. 

For starters:
The chili oil dumplings was probably the best dim sum plate that I ordered. The dumpling filling had good flavor and the chili oil complimented the dumplings. The foie sui mai was average as it tasted bland compared to the chili oil dumplings. The lions head meatball, although had nice presentation, did not deliver in taste. The meatball itself was under seasoned and bland, but the sauce was very salty. 

For entrees: 
The shrimp fried rice was on the moist side, which is not typical for Chinese fried rice. The rice was seasoned well and tasted pretty good. The spicy basil noodles had good flavor and I thought it was a balanced noodle dish. The general tso chicken tasted light and doesn't taste heavily drenched in sauce like from your average local Chinese take out. The crab cakes, although not a typical Chinese dish, were seasoned well, but the consistency was weird as if I was eating a flaky salmon. The complimentary bok choy was a refreshing element to the dish that cut the richness of the crab cakes. 

Service was friendly and attentive. Overall, the food had nice presentation and good flavors, despite some seasoning issues in some dishes. The portions were appreciable. The overall price value is okay, although I thought the foie sui mai was underwhelming and expensive and didn't think was worth the $18.",2021-01-07 21:42:24,326,1683,

I applied for life and disability insurances, and bought ID theft protection. Being a brokerage firm and being able to shop around, Zander was cheapest compared to 2 other quotes I got from other companies.

The ID Theft protection I got from Zander has been awesome so far. Very affordable and I feel very safe having it. I recommend it!

For life insurance, they sent me to Protective Insurance. Protective was good to work with and got me my quote in a respectable amount of time.

For disability insurance, they got me connected to Assurity. I regret ever applying because we are now over 3 months in and still trying to get things sorted out from the accusations they made against me. The way things are going, I bet it will take another 2+ months to solidify anything, but if I don't go through their hoops, they will leave a black mark on my medical record that is false and I'm just not willing to let that happen.

I did the phone interview (almost an hour) and disclosed every medical thing in my history I could think of. They ended up denying me because they requested to see my counselor's notes and through those notes, gave me diagnoses that my counselor never gave me, and claimed I didn't disclose them. I called my counselor up after seeing my denial letter from Assurity and my counselor was dumbfounded at how they could have come to the conclusions they did. I emailed the underwriting team at the suggestion of a nice customer service rep (only good thing about Assurity so far), explaining this misunderstanding, and was ghosted.

After all this happened, Rebecca from Zander's team reached out and asked for more info about what was going on with Assurity. She was helpful over the phone and was just as confused as I was that I would be approved for the best/healthiest life insurance policy with protective but denied disability insurance through Assurity. She made it sound like it would be a quick fix, which unfortunately it hasn't been. She passed me off to Nikki, who has been great to work with over the phone, and is currently working to figure things out between me and Assurity. But it still seems like things are a ways off from being finished and will require some significant leg work and money (some of these tests they want me to retake are $500+, even though I've already given them the original results that prove I don't have a disease they claim I have).

Ordered myself the KIPOS salad for myself with no beets and extra Greek dressing with a side of tzatziki sauce and a Gyro platter for my hubs with no rice and extra veggies, no pita bread and side of tzatziki sauce.  From the time I placed the order to the first available time for pickup was 45 minutes. 

Arrived at AW at 11:05 but order wasn't set to be ready until 11:30. So we met our friends and grabbed a table and drink.  Walked over at 11:27 since no text or email indicating the order was ready or not. I stood in line since it was short and nobody available to ask if the bag on the counter was mine and very very little space to walk over to that area given people in line. When I got up to the register the clerk didn't even greet me, just stood there so I said I placed an order online.  He didn't ask me anything to confirm my order, just grabbed the bag and handed it to me and walked away. Even though I asked is this all.  Walked back to the table and opened the boxes to see our food was all there however not as we imagined at all. The chicken and gyro meat were little chunks and not shredded. I said no beets but my salad had beets. Nowhere does it say that the salad comes with potato salad but it was mixed into the salad. I had no extra Greek dressing and the tzatziki sauce was like water!! $32.48 of food and it was definitely NOT worth it at all.  You can see from the item descriptions I've included here that nowhere does it say potato salad with the Kipos salad and my hubs says shaven gyro meat but they were in chunks. 

They need better customer service. They need to notify the customer when the order is ready. They need to give better quality food for the price. They need to clarify clearly what is included with the food. The to go containers for the platters are horrible! They are small making it nearly impossible to eat together. Have to utilize the lid for extra space.  We were excited about Greek cuisine today only to be disappointed in the end.",2021-01-24 23:13:55,425,2032,

Her deadbolt was loose, and while my key went in fine - it wouldn't turn in either direction (to lock or unlock). I called (after reading SO many great reviews) and though he said he was VERY busy this week, he'd do his best to fit me in - if I was flexible about the time. Since I didn't have anywhere else to be yesterday, I said that was fine. He called me back around 3:30 and said he'd be here before 4:00. He was right on time, and I was happy to see he was wearing a mask. I asked if he would like me to wear one too, but said that no - unless I was planning on breathing down his neck the whole time he'd be there, that wasn't necessary. (and of course, I just wanted to let him do his job!) 

I showed him what the issue was, and he said it wouldn't take but a minute to tighten up the lock. While he was working, he mentioned that the bolt part of the lock was very old and worn (and actually, they don't even make that part anymore) and suggested a replacement. I said that would be fine. Then he noticed that the bolt wasn't matching up with the hole in the door frame very well, and that he could fix that too. It took him just a few minutes, then he even went to the trouble of vacuuming up the bit of sawdust that had been created.

For appetizers, we had the carpaccio with greens in the center and truffle oil. This was fantastic - you could really taste the truffle oil.  My only suggestion would be that they paint a little bit of that truffle oil underneath the carpaccio in the center because meat stuck to the plate. We also have the octopus and as long as the crostini was on a separate plate, this was gluten-free. Same thing with a carpaccio. For dinner, I had the jambalaya and oh Em Gee. Apparently, some diners have complained that it is too spicy. My opinion: they eat half of the plate and send it back for a refund claiming it's too spicy and this is a bold-faced lie! It is not too spicy! It has very fresh seafood and it was very, very good. If I had a bigger stomach I would've eaten the entire dish. 

The husband had the shrimp tacos and the fries. The fries, interestingly enough, came with a sunny-side-up egg on top and this is something we've never seen before. They also were covered in truffle oil. His only complaint is that they weren't skinny fries but he did eat a lot of them. The tacos, he thoroughly enjoyed but he did wish they had a corn tortilla option so that they could be gluten-free so that I could've had some.

Wines are reasonably priced and you can get a 6 or 9-ounce pour. My husband enjoyed his Manhattan but he's only thought there was that it was missing the cherry. But again, it is really a place that you should go to when you are in Clearwater, especially when you're looking for something a little more casual and comfortable after you've been doing fine dining for several nights.

The establishment overall was newer and clean, which we liked. 

It's kind of weird and unique how they run the pool table area of the bar, as they have a stand alone booth and person when you first walk in, who's only in charge of assisting you with the pool tables. 

And as other Yelpers have mentioned, it is pretty much a rip off as to how much they charge to play pool; it is literally like $7.50 PER PERSON, PER HOUR! Wow, never heard of charging per person for pool, ever! It was around $30 an hour to play pool for four of us, which ended up being around $60 for two hours! But, the pool tables were at least very nice, and they even ask you for your choice of wooden or graphite stick, kinda cool.

As mentioned, you can tell they renovated everything inside, and most of the game machines are all brand new. They have a whole wall of games like darts, basketball, arcade games, air hockey, etc. Everything was new and clean.

I didn't even go over to the main bar, we had a great server. But, also as other Yelpers have mentioned, the TV layout is kind of weird overall. They have this whole row of small TVs on the far wall near the bars, and different sized (but not small) TVs scattered around the pool tables. 

I'm not sure if I'd go back, only bc I like playing pool, and it's pretty expensive to do so there. 

We were really done playing after an hour or so, but after drinking and watching the games around the pool table, we forgot to return them to the booth, and had to pay for an additional hour, which ended up being $30 wasted. I'm sure they make a lot of extra money from people who make the same mistake as we did, and not return everything immediately after you're done. Oh well, it was a good time.",2021-01-09 13:49:39,431,1894,

Stopped by here in that nice dead zone between Christmas and NYE since there's outdoor seating and, you know, pandemic.

We started out with the Arancini balls and Bruschetta.  First off, if you've never had an arancini ball, definitely try them here.  They're the perfect balance of creamy cheese and rice all fried together and served with a Bolognese sauce that'll just make your mouth water and your brain to day dream of it when you least expect it.  AHmazing.  The bruschetta was also quite lovely.  The flavors were spot on with what you'd expect, and my favorite part was how thin the crostini was that it was served on.  You weren't overpowered or out-crunched by it; it was all beautifully balanced.

We then had the Di Carne (all the meats!) pizza.  By this point, we were actually quite full, but it was also so yummy, and it reheated quite well as leftovers, so there was no sadness in my world that day.

To top it all off, they were great about being socially distant and letting us sit outside to avoid the other clients (until we decided to move inside after hearing distant gunshots), but then they let us sit by ourselves on the far side of the restaurant, so it was still so well spaced and feeling even more safe!

Short story on our goldendoodle... For years previous to this we had been trying to get vets to address our dog licking his bum uncontrollably (vets in NV and WI), then he got a limp and no one could figure out exactly what was going on. They put him on pain meds and called it arthritis or suggested invasive surgeries to try and figure out what the issue was. 
Fast forward to a few months ago, our dog looks like he has a deep wound on his bum. Dr. Daniel's didn't have an opening but she gave us many close locations to take him too, so we took him to a 24 hour animal ER for surgery of a ruptured anal gland.  We had no idea what we were in for and it ended up being way messier than just that issue.

Dr. Daniel's was our main vet for post op appointments and for the mess she walked into (Dr. Sutter also helped immensely), she did so amazing at diagnosing our baby after he wasn't healing properly despite doing everything we could. She worked long stressful hours to try and figure out exactly what was going on with our boy and got him on the road to recovery and healed after figuring out he had a chronic anal fissure condition. This whole mess took about 4 months, 4 surgeries/procedures and countless office visits, but I never doubted the care our babe was getting at this office, I knew he was in good hands. 

They are also doing everything they can to keep us all safe during this pandemic, and as someone who has a compromised immune system, I definitely appreciate these extra measures being taken. Curb side vet appointments can be a stressful thing, but the staff here make me feel reassured our babies are being taken care of and always made our dogs feel like they are just stopping to say hi to their friends. I have never had an issue filling any prescriptions or making appointments, they are always so friendly & accommodating. They always find space to fit us in when we need it, we know this isn't easy as they are a busy location. We travel on the road a lot, but Dr. Daniel's will continue to be our go to vet for our dogs, this has been the first office in years to actually address the issues we needed addressed they don't push dental cleanings and other costly procedures, they actually focus on the issues you are there for and I know this is why they are the first office who actually has cared about our dogs and not the money.

Once my car was brought into a bay an hour after my appointment time, and after another hour or so of waiting, I was informed that two of my wheel locks had to be ""hammered off"" (with no discussion prior) and that I could ""safely drive"" with 4 lugs on two of my wheels.  At this point I no longer trusted my vehicle with the employees of this establishment so I didn't argue.  I drove to the nearest parking lot away from Discount Tire and, using the OEM lugs that were in my glove box this entire time (if anyone bothered to look...), I replaced the now missing wheel locks myself and torqued these to spec when I got home.  I fear for anyone that was unable to do this on their own, or that wouldn't know to take care of it in a timely fashion because the store employee basically shrugged this off as a cost of doing business at Discount Tire and acted as if it was completely safe and harmless long-term.",2021-01-21 04:01:24,304,1467,
1HHvKRMNsMlNvvlGBg_GiA,b0b2TPhi_LlF4BaXoqxygg,L5LLN0RafiV1Z9cddzvuCw,5,7,5,6,"This is always one of my favorite places to visit when I am in Tampa! I have been here on every single trip that I have taken to Florida and every time, I end off at the outside bar with a Frosé in hand. There is just something about the mix they make and how icy cold delicious it is in the beautiful, warm weather of Tampa. You must have a obligatory Frosé when you visit Ulele. Smack the fresh mint it comes with a couple of times and it really brings out its refreshing flavor. 

Also very cool- they serve their Frosé to go in the official Riverwalk plastic cup. You can walk up and down the Riverwalk with it. Pretty awesome! I have definitely done that a few times. 

The outside patio area at Ulele is huge! It's decked out with statues and some really awesome artwork. From Humpty Dumpty on their roof to the Three Little Pigs in the back, it feels like you are walking in a really fun, vivid dream. And- you would be missing out of you did not snap a picture of the Princess Ulele statue that is anchored in a water spring surrounded by a ring of fire. There is a very cool story attached to this statue. Check out the pics I took. It's a real beauty. 

I take a picture of the Ulele statue every time I visit as well. I'd usually be there for New year's Eve and she has such a pretty fireworks backdrop that night. 

I wish that I could say I have tried their food in all of my visits. Sadly, I can't. 

Happily, it has been for drinks though! 

I am definitely looking forward to sampling their menu next visit. I swear it will happen next time! Really!",2021-01-06 07:10:21,338,1565,

If not for this, 5 stars all the way. The restaurant is beautiful, the staff is trained for fine dining, attentive without being pesky, the drinks are balanced, the wine selection is solid, and all the other dishes were good as expected.

Everything else was very good. We started the evening off with drinks and what was surprisingly refreshing and lo-cal was Botanical Delight on the drink menu.  We did both with the Fever Tree Tonic and one Grapefruit & Rose and one Peach and Orange. These were very refreshing and if I had to have only one, the Grapefruit & Rose is the superior of the two.

For the table, we had the JUMBO LUMP CRAB CAKE, which has no filler and is completely gluten-free. This crab cake is delicious, fresh, and moist. You will not be disappointed. CRUSTED DIVER SCALLOPS were excellent and went down easily.  The STRAWBERRY SALAD was good but a bit underwhelming. I am not sure what was missing from this salad. Otherwise, it was very fresh and crisp.  The restaurant does have gluten-free cheesy bread that was brought to the table and very good by GF standards. I could eat nothing but a large basket of this and be happy.

For dinner, I have the GULF GROUPER with English pea risotto, foraged mushrooms, artichokes, heirloom tomato, Parmesan Reggiano, and sage béarnaise. The flavors were amazing and I would totally get this dish again as everything was fresh. The only problem was that the fish was dry and this is likely due to what was done to get the crisp on the outside. The risotto was also dry and not at all creamy. The individual pieces of rice were not sticking to each other in any way. I had to keep taking sips of water due to the dryness of the dish.

Other dinners in my group have the AHI TUNA with Coriander & red corn crust, Okinawan sweet potato purée, baby bok choy, carrots, and miso ginger kabayaki, and the DUROC PORK CHOPS with Bourbon Cider Glaze. Both of them very very happy with the temperatures, flavors, and side dishes. My MOL raved about the baby bok choy. My husband was very happy that the pork was a slightly pink and not overdone. 

For dessert, we have the french vanilla creme brulee and one scoop of the in-house made dark chocolate ice cream.  The creme brulee was good but the ice cream was special. Skip the creme brulee and get two scoops of any of their four flavors of in-house made ice creams.",2021-01-05 16:42:33,514,2524,
hEZR3NjW_FoCP7rcNICWCw,Rftb40v5Bvly6c8w5VrWrg,pRkw4Kfs3tsMU1bgwwB5ig,1,4,0,0,"When I adopted my kitty, his current vet was The Cat Practice. So I continued to have him seen here. He is an older domestic shorthair with a thyroid problem. This means he is on prescription food. I was constantly told he needed his internal organs checked, a slew of vaccines, professional dental cleaning, an echocardiogram, blood tests, and a bunch of other services that seemed excessive. When I asked the price of the visit, I was told it would be upwards of $560. I wasn't able to afford that price for a regular cat visit, (and apparently he'd need these services on a regular basis) so I asked what the minimum would be in order to continue him on his food, and I was basically told the only way he'd be able to get seen is to complete all of these treatments. 

I begin looking for other vets. Not to mention, I am getting called multiple times a day, multiple times a week. I have more calls from The Cat Practice than my own doctor. And the emails are out of control. Every time I do answer, I'm told, ""Hi, we are so glad to finally hear back from you. We've been so worried about Pipe and would hate to see his health decline. He needs to be seen for these treatments or we don't know what will happen."" I begin to feel I am being a horrible cat mom, so I try again to speak with them. After all, I love my cat, as we all love our animals, and do not want him to be sick or in pain, or declining. 

At this point, I'm trying to explain that at the base minimum, to continue on him on the food that keeps his thyroid in check, what in the least needs to be done, and I'd try to do the other treatments later when I could. Again, they insist he needs every single service in order to even see him. I felt I was left no choice but to get a second opinion. 

THE FINAL STRAW, when I explained to Ginger at the front desk that I couldn't afford $560+ for a visit, she asked me if I was still employed with my company, and literally said, ""Well, talk to them, see if they'll handle the bill, and then give me a call back."" That was it. I have never in my life heard of a vet office suggest a client ask their place of employment for financial help. 

I get his medical records from the Cat Practice and bring him to his new vet. They see Pipe, look through his medical records prior to the visit and explain during his exam that Pipe is in wonderful health for a 10 year old kitty. His thyroid has been in normal levels for quite a while, and the only thing required for his prescription food was a simple blood test to check his thyroid. This visit was $150 including a full exam, and panel. That's it. And they wrote me the prescription and off we went. 

Please consider the fact that I spend everyday with this cat. He is very playful, has a healthy appetite, keeps a nice clean coat,  has normal bowel movements and his urine isn't unusual in anyway. There are no signs of anything unusual, unhealthy, or to be concerned about. I am not a negligent cat owner, and I spend lots of time inspecting him making sure he is good, no wounds, bites, and no overgrooming, etc.

Beware of The Cat Practice. They are extremely pushy, unprofessional, and insist on services that are unnecessary, while painting a picture that your beloved pet is in medical danger. I hope, if you are bringing your animal to this practice, that you get a second opinion.",2021-01-06 16:58:04,744,3353,

We figured the wait would be 30 minutes to an hour (I'm sure the line looked longer due to social distancing as well).  But not too long after standing in line, someone came walking down the line asking for a party of two.  Apparently everyone ahead of us had a big party or had a party of three.  YAY for us!

We got seated immediately and ordered some drinks like usual.  Took a look at the menu and ended up ordering: Cajun Fries, Crawfish Étouffée Sample, and a Soft Shell Crab as our appetizer.  We ordered a Cajun Jambalaya Pasta to share (I wasn't too hungry).  

Even though I didn't order an entree for myself, it was more than enough food to share.  Everything was AMAZING!  Thank goodness for our waiter who asked if we wanted a 1/2 order of Cajun Fries or a Full Order.  We decided to go with the 1/2 order and wholly cow, it was A LOT! I'm so glad we got the 1/2 order, it wasn't an option on the menu so I'm glad she told us otherwise we might have wasted food (but then again, it was so good....I might have just finished it and regretted it). 

The Crawfish Étouffée sample was a tease....but still glad we didn't order a whole entree because we would have been stuffed.  

The Soft Shell Crab was DELICIOUS!!!

The Cajun Jambalaya Pasta was packing in flavor and had a good kick to it.  Maybe a bit much for my husband, but I loved it.

Definitely recommend to anyone visiting New Orleans.  It will be worth your wait and the food is  YUMMY!",2021-01-21 02:25:35,333,1525,

Or even be a smidge willing to work with me on it at all during a time like this apparently. Why? Because only you matter and only you have needs, Sharon? Also obviously mold in the walls that transferred onto boxes next to them. Very old appliances. Never-ending roaches and earwigs. Useless maintenance workers who are interested in avoiding doing their job at all costs. You name it. All I wanted was a decent place I could be left alone. You left me alone alright, but you were not decent. Dealing with problems doesn't seem to be something y'all do. And it's true what others say about safety concerns. Can't put anything in the trash without rude a** homeless d*cks littering the entire parking lot with it overnight. Only reason I'm putting 2 stars is because of the washer/dryer and location that made the rent value pretty decent. Initially anyway.

Its a good thing too, because now I know you wouldn't have helped me anyway like you didn't in the end.

I stumbled upon these folks here as well as on Facebook Marketplace. They're close by and family owned so I reached out; they responded in a flash!

So I set up a delivery time for today, as the owner's wife said that they could deliver right away...I really lucked out as they are a very busy operation! So out they came and dropped off around a fifth of a cord. They stacked it in a nice neat pile in a corner of my garage.

Joe the owner also tossed in a few pieces of pine for the fun of it. He asked me if I'd like to have a nice odor in the fireplace (lol)! Very nice man who seems quite hands on in his business. His wife Lorri is a nice and pleasant person too!

Anyway, after they left we tossed a couple of those big old hunks of wood into the fireplace. Wow; this stuff is burning nicely and creates a lovely aroma in my living room! 

They have a ""yard"" near Largo Hospital and appreciate it if you go pick up your firewood. However they deliver cheerfully for a mere $10 if you're not horribly far away. So I paid for this mountain of firewood a mere $55 delivery included. 

That's three bundles, all stacked neatly as I asked. So I'd say that's at least 60 pretty healthy sized logs out there in the ol' woodpile. That works out to under a dollar per piece. Try getting THAT kinda value from your local Lowe's, Walmart or 7-11 if even they HAVE any in stock. 

As I indicated earlier, this is a locally owned small business, so I'm more than happy to support them. I really got a lot of bang for my buck, so I'd definitely call myself a future repeat customer. If you need firewood, give these folks a chance. You'll be glad you did!",2021-01-07 21:42:50,389,1734,

I am sure you are reading so many reviews researching where to send your dog trying to compare options for your most prized possession.  I LOVE my animals just like my kids. We sent our dog here for the 2-week training program.  I toured their facility and wow it was impeccable, so clean you could eat off the floors with multiple mock rooms for home simulations to teach the dogs. The plexiglass kennels were so spacious, so you don't have to worry about small cages or dirty kennels. 
Our old English bulldog is 4 years old and has struggled with following commands, jumping on guests, and was viscous with other dogs. With the techniques my dog Armani learned at Nashville K-9 from Ali and his ROCKSTAR team he is a changed dog. He still has the awesome personality he had before training but now he listens to commands and is able to walk on a leash in the community. His listening skills are 1000% improved. He listens so well now that even my 7 and 12-year-old kids can work with him on his new skills at home. The huge training floor allowed him to also learn jumping and walking obediently on the top of the line equipment which exceeded my expectations. 
Being such an attached owner; I really struggled with leaving Armani, but Ali and his team sent us so many pictures, videos, and emails showing his progress throughout each week to help us cope with the absence in our home. They genuinely care about your dog and understand the void it causes to a family. 
I chose Nashville K-9 because when I learned about their stellar program, I loved that they give a 2-hour training for the owners that we would get to learn how to keep his new skills. Raine did our 2-hour training on his last day and she was so knowledgeable and spent so much time making sure we learned correctly. She even gave us local recommendations supporting the community, shared a training collar and clicker recommendation that works well for Armani. They even have a store you can shop from to offer you convenience with the best products.  Armani adored his trainers I loved so many things about this place but one of my favorites was that they teach the animals with positive affirmations and don't use shock collars like some facilities I was researching. My kids were so scared our dog wouldn't come home with the same awesome personality he left with and they assured us he would. They were SO RIGHT! 
The coachfido.com website is awesome too for continued reinforcement and we have even tried a few new tricks to teach Armani since he has been home.  I can't rave enough about this facility and waited a couple weeks to write this because I wanted to see how all the new skills would transfer when he got home. SEAMLESSLY!!! He doesn't even jump on the UPS drivers now. I don't usually write reviews, but this place has a special place in my heart for a VERY LONG TIME!!! 

Thank You Nashville K-9 for all you have done for Armani and our family!",2021-01-01 01:26:30,586,2972,

I only remember that because it was right before my brother graduated high school and I knew my parents were looking to possibly cater BBQ for his grad party. 

Fast forward to December 2020. I started working in the same parking lot which meant I had a lunch spot that I didn't have to get in my car to get to. I also knew that they had made an appearance on DDD earlier in the year and I was looking forward to trying more of their food. 

So far I've been in twice. It's quick, easy to pickup and delicious. My first lunch was a pulled pork burrito. After looking through photos of burritos here on Yelp I was hoping to snag a Buffalo Chicken burrito but found out it was a special for ""Burrito Monday's"" and wasn't available otherwise. Dang! The burrito was huge. I think I may have skipped dinner that night. LOL

This last trip I picked up a Brisket Sandwich with some fries. I also got some smoky BBQ sauce to go with it. Another huge sandwich that probably shouldn't have eaten all in one sitting but I couldn't help myself. I usually don't go crazy with BBQ sauce but I dipped my sandwich all the way down to the last bite. I really liked the seasoned fries but they aren't great cold - this was my fault. I got busy and it took me longer to walk over and pick up my food. If I was at home I could have thrown them in the air fryer but at work my only option was a microwave and I wasn't about to ruin them like that. 

Now that I have finally gotten around to watching the episode of DDD this week, I'm looking forward to trying the Rib Tips and the Filet Mignon Sandwich. I'll update when I do.",2021-01-16 05:53:16,363,1675,

This Panera is located at Glendale Town Center in front of the current location of Glendale Library. I've been a longtime customer and actually thought I'd already written a review. This location has historically been a little hit-and-miss. It used to be my ""go to"" option because of a super friendly manager whose service was top-notch. I've had a handful of times in my life when the service was so good at a restaurant that I became a regular, or semi-regular, and this Panera was one of them. 

As a disabled adult who lives alone, I tend to like places where I feel a sense of community. This Panera gave me that. Eventually, of course, she left. The next team that came in wasn't nearly as strong and my days at this Panera were fewer. The interior was messier. The service was more lax. This lasted for several months. While I will never know if others noticed, it's true that eventually that management went away and was replaced by the current team that seems to have this location back on the upswing. 

This location has a drive-thru, a definite plus these days. They enforce mandates to the best of their ability and employees wear masks, practice social distancing, and are clearly much more concerned about cleanliness. 

I've not been inside during this pandemic. I've heard good things about the curbside, though I'll admit the app doesn't seem to like my phone and I typically get frustrated and give up. So, I mostly utilize drive-thru. 

They've become super conscientious about asking if we're MyPanera members, a definite plus because it keeps track of rewards and encourages them to build relationships by using our names. There's still fluctuation in work performance - when certain supervisors are working, they're on their game. When they aren't? Things are a bit more casual and mistakes get made. However, it's definitely improving. 

Panera also offers delivery. They've had some menu changes recently - some mac n' cheese options, flatbread pizzas (I've had the Margherita and didn't care for it), and a brownie that is to die for. 

They have an $8.99 a month unlimited coffee deal and are currently offering 3 free months. 

I had a limb amputation in late 2019 and one of my first ""outings"" was a trip to the adjacent library and wheeling across the parking lot to Panera. It was awesome. 

There are other locations in Indy, of course, and this one can still be hit-and-miss - this is obvious from reading other reviews. However, overall, I'd say it's returning upward and becoming a place I enjoy going again. The menu steers leans toward healthier and cleaner and most, though certainly not all, of the tables inside are wheelchair friendly. They have accessible parking (though the curb has a lip that has caused me to tumble more than once) with two entry doorways that are a tad heavy. The order pick-up counter is also high, which will be difficult for anyone in a wheelchair or with reach issues. So, there are some accessibility concerns. 

While I tend to mostly review local restaurants, during this pandemic I'm appreciative of any restaurant continuing to make sure folks are safe and Panera has certainly adapted well to the changing restaurant landscape.",2021-01-12 11:06:07,676,3384,

I've been here 3 times so far and have always been greeted by a friendly ""hello"" each time! The employees are part of what makes this place so great! Always so sweet. They work very hard to please! There are several ingredients to choose from and you currently start by filling out your order form (if you order in person. You can also order online ahead and pick up, or Uber eats delivers from here.) You choose a base, a protein, your veggies and toppings. And, any sauce you might want. I love the yummy sauce! There's bubble tea as well as other fruit juices in a can to choose from for drinks. They also have fountain drinks or water. My food has always been so crisp and fresh. I love the spicy tuna! 

Currently, employees wear masks and gloves. I'm under the impression masks are mandatory. However, while there a customer came in without a mask. I'm pretty sure the young high school aged employee said something to the customer to no avail. So it wasn't the employees fault. Everyone else followed the rules. Surfaces are sanitized in between customers and social distancing is encouraged as well.

I went into the lobby, as I was a little concerned about the length of the drive-thru line and I was on a short lunch break. I should have just stuck it out, though - by the time I walked out with my food the line was almost gone and I think they were different cars that were left there anyway. I mean, how much better does it get? I wasn't inside for 10 minutes!

Some things you need to know about Freddy's, if you've never been there. The burger patties are thin. I mean like, 1990s waif-supermodel THIN. They get a little thicker in the middle but overall....the average adult human is going to want a double burger. Bigger appetite? Go for the triple! 

The other thing that's super-thin are the French fries. They ain't called shoestring fries for nothin' - they really aren't much thicker than that. If you're not a fan of eating a handful of fries at a time, order the tots, or better yet, the cheese curds (and let me know how those are, will you?) 

New to me was the jalapeno French fry sauce. I supposed it might grow on me, but I'm pretty much a ketchup girl. It was tasty, just not my thing, I guess.

We are now with Nationwide and have better coverage for less money. Do yourself a favor and stay away from Pets Worst! 
------------------------------------------

So, we had Healthy Paws insurance prior to signing up with Pets Best. I switched because Healthy Paws were seriously jacking up our policy price and I was looking for better coverage. I signed up for Pets Best thinking that I was getting a better policy; however, I am SOOOOO disappointed in the service I am receiving thus far. 

My dog went to the vet on January 15, 2021 for a wellness check, a vaccine booster and some flea medicine. Simple. I submitted the claim on the 15th and to date, January 27th, it still shows that it was only ""received."" I tried chatting with someone named JaymeLin on their website, who didn't seem to really care what I had to say, and kept feeding me a bunch of BS on how it takes 39 days to process a claim. Excuse me? 39 days??? WHAT!? Healthy Paws processes their claims in 2 days, TOPS. 

JaymeLin then told me that because there were a couple of medications on the invoice, they had to look into it. I then explained that our 90lb rescue dog was horribly beaten by his previous owner, whom he ran away from, and will not let anyone touch his paws or cut his nails. So the medication is to help calm him down before his next vet appointment so they can trim his nails. I get the same canned response from her about having to in the order the claim was received, blah blah blah.

I am far from impressed with this pet insurance company and will be looking into new coverage with another carrier. 

Pets Best is more like Pets Worst.",2021-01-27 17:32:01,481,2223,

They scammed and demanded additional fees at the time of pick up and delivery.  At pick up the estimate given by the broker All movers, was not correct and my furniture required additional cubic feet.  I had been very specific about my furniture sizes and gave information about the 2 bedrooms.  Despite this I was told I needed to pay an additional $900 or I could leave some furniture behind.
Upon delivery the same mover, Miguel (aka Leo), immediately stated it would be an additional fee for the stairs.  Again All Movers had been informed about the stairs and charged an extra $150.  Miguel was loud, bullying and threatened to not bring the furniture into the home.  He insisted on an additional $225 and wanted payment in full before any items would be brought into the home.  
Of the 3 movers only 1 wore his mask properly despite repeated reminders.  One did not even wear a mask.
Now we get to damages....the bed posts were broken as if they had been smashed, my vintage/antique hope chest had a leg broken off, splintered and smashed, a nightstand appeared to have been dropped causing total misalignment, dresser drawers unable to close properly due to damage, temperpedic mattress damaged at all four corners, torn and tattered and 2 stick lamps one of which was a refurbished antique were destroyed and are no longer usable.
This company was awful and the main mover who did all the talking was rude, loud and a major scam artist.
They left someone's broken picture frame and broken glass all over the street and made no effort to clean up their mess.

I had a reservation so checking in wasn't bad except for the fact that my bank sometimes sends me a text before authorizing charges to my card. So when I gave the Asian female at the front desk my card she asked if I had another card I could use. I said yes I do but I have plenty of money on that card and that's the one I'm using. Then I let her know my bank may be declining the card until I verify it's me making the purchase. Just then I received a text from my bank and I confirmed it was a legit charge so that was fine. After I went to my room I checked my card and saw she ran it eight times for a smaller amount each time. I guess she thought it was declined because I didn't have money. Anyway when I got to my room I just wasn't impressed. It was dusty and had an odor like old food or something, this was at 9pm. The carpets were dirty like they've never ever been shampooed. It was the worst Marriott Courtyard I've ever stayed at. I was told they don't have daily housekeeping due to COVID, and I understand that but they should at least clean and disinfect the rooms after someone checks out, and make sure they're dusted at least once a week if no one stays in the room. I always take disinfecting wipes with me and wiped everything down from the light switches door and closet handles, desk, remote, sink and faucet, I mean everything.

It was completely underwhelming.

I will say first - our waitress was outstanding and the service all around was great. However, the food, not so much. 

We had:

Crawfish balls:
- These were actually very good. I would recommend it! 

The combination platter: ""BBQ Shrimp"" & ""Stuffed Crab""
- The BBQ shrimp was a complete disgrace to the city of New Orleans. I have NEVER been to a restaurant that puts the shrimp in LITERAL BBQ sauce.... I do not recommend it. Terrible. We sent it back. 

- The ""Stuffed Crab"" is just stuffing that comes in a mini aluminum foil container, however, the flavor was pretty okay.

The Shrimp on the Avenue pasta
- The pasta sauce was really good, and the noodles were cooked well. However, the shrimp were pretty bland and unfortunately served cold. 

Seafood platter w/ double mac & cheese (side):
- The mac and cheese was very good if you are a fan of extremely creamy mac. Fried fish was decent too.  Not much better than a seafood platter you could get somewhere else for half the price.

Chargrilled Oysters
- pretty good! 7/10. (Dragos and Acme are better though.)
Overall, I guess I would say I just expected much more of the food based on all the hype around Neyow's.

All in all, it could've been better. I probably won't be back.

Oh, not to mention, we went during covid & the city of new orleans moved back to phase I with a 25% capacity, but apparently Neyow's did not follow. There was a large table of 16 people sitting behind us, luckily we left soon after.",2021-01-15 05:12:19,364,1671,

I have an allergy, and after finding allergen information on the Sushi Boss website, ordered an OMG Roll without Boss Sauce. After my husband brought everything home, I happily opened my OMG Roll and began to eat it. Unfortunately, not being familiar with the appearance of the Boss Sauce, I didn't realize immediately that it was on the roll, despite clear instructions to omit it. After eating a few pieces and scanning everyone else's rolls, I realized that the sauce on top mine must be Boss Sauce. Thankfully, I don't have anaphylactic reactions to dairy, but I still do have very unpleasant side effects that I was trying to avoid. 

I called Sushi Boss and was told that they'd refund the roll and offered a free roll on my next visit. The man didn't take apologize or ask for any information other than my husband's name. Today (Tuesday), we didn't have a refund so I called the restaurant again, only to be told that the refund must come from Grub Hub, since that's how we placed the order (through Yelp). I'm not worried about the free roll since I won't be back, but I would like to be refunded for the dinner I couldn't eat and the physical distress I felt through the night as a result of the preparer's carelessness. I did call Grub Hub about the refund and got that going. 

TL;DR: If you have allergies, double-check your food before leaving with your take-out. Otherwise, you might very well be left sick and/or without your meal. Everyone else enjoyed their meal, though, and the roll looked good.",2021-01-12 17:18:03,340,1613,

This place has a very nice ambiance from being greeted at the door to the felt chairs to the golden marbled tables. My parent dined here for NYE dinner and it was crowded but not overcrowded. We were seated promptly with reservation and water was poured. The service here was good and attentive as our table had multiple people checking up on us and bring food and drinks. The food came out very quickly as did the drinks. The ""Listen Linda"" which had two peppers by it to indicate it was spicy surprisingly had a good spicynes to it as I feel sometimes restaurants call drinks ""spicy"" that are not. The ""Oh My Word"" was very strong as it's ingredients shown are only liqueurs and liquor but is a well built cocktail. The last drink that was tried was the ""Bollita"" I substituted the tequila for vodka though. It was a nice drink as well. Their drinks air more on the bitter and alcohol forward side versus more balanced with hints of sweetness. Their garnishes are minimal. They make their drinks strong here. My table ordered a few small plates: wedge salad, chicken wings, octopus, burrata. There was nothing out of the ordinary for the wedge. The chicken wings had an incredible sauce that was everything Korean bbq should be. The burrata melted in your mouth. I got the Wagyu for my main course and it did not disappoint! Probably one of the best steaks I've ever had especially for a filet. It was cooked to perfect and so tender that you could cut it with a butter knife since the servers forgot to give me a knife. The broccolini and fingerling potatoes that were under the Wagyu were delightful as well. Overall, a great dining experience and great food.

He advised us to purchase a new unit because of age of the unit. My husband told him we've never had a problem with the system in 12 years, and didn't want to replace it if it can be repaired. The technician talked him into a service contract that included a 10 point inspection 2 times a year. Labor for repairs would be covered, and any parts replacements needed would come with a discount. The fan blade was ordered, and installed after a month or so (we weren't using the A/C because it was november-December at the time). 
The technician came out to do the 10 point service. The tech told my husband that we needed 2 parts to be replaced, and that they would call when they came in. They discussed the cost, and my husband even questioned how expensive the capacitor was, but he trusted the technician, and agreed to the repairs. My husband had researched the cost of the fan blade, and what hutchinson charged was reasonable. Why would my husband question the legitimacy of the cost for these two parts? 

Today, we got a call that the parts were in and they'd be out to install after 2PM. The tech arrived, and went to the furnace. He asked me then ""Did your husband leave his credit card here?""  I thought that was a very odd thing to ask, and I began to feel uncomfortable. My husband, who had been upstairs, came downstairs and spoke to the tech. 

After 10 minutes of being in the house, the job was complete. We paid the bill, which was exorbitant (despite the discount we got for having a contract with them).  We were charged $149.00 for a flame sensor and $260.00 for a inducer run capacitor. The tech left the house. I told my husband about the credit card comment. We both became suspicious.  My husband decided to look online for the cost of those parts. The flame sensors run about $15 and the capacitor about $25.  Our daughter called a friend of hers who is an HVAC specialist and he said we were ridiculously overcharged. We estimated we were charged 1000% markup for the parts. 

By the way, the tech never changed/nor cleaned the filter, which is part of the service contract we purchased. 

We have called the company and the customer service rep is looking into the gross overcharge. She said they charge a flat rate, and they are definitely more expensive than other area companies. 

We didn't do our due diligence by researching the company and reviews, and we're paying the price. No one likes to feel duped, especially by a company that's been in business as long as they have.  The whole experience leaves a bad taste. 

We decided not to do further business with Hutchinson.  Through our daughter, we found a much better option.",2021-01-23 02:33:16,576,2777,

This office is very easy to find, it's a stand alone building with a parking lot out front. The building and inside seem on the newer side, and furniture is not torn or worn. Simple and quaint ambiance. 
For covid precautions, they take your temperature upon entering, neat touch less gadget. You also have the option to fill out paper work through a link that they provide via text message prior to your appointment, very convenient. The waiting area's seating is spread apart for social distancing to follow covid regulations.
Teresa, a dental hygienist at this office, is wonderful, personable, and caring. I always request her for my son and my teeth cleaning. She has an extremely gentle touch and is appreciably kind. Most importantly, my teeth feel so clean after a visit with her. I can tell she is really passionate about dental hygiene and she is highly knowledgeable. I had questions about what my insurance would cover which she went above and beyond to find out the answer, instead of sending me to the front desk. She also made my follow up appointment and took my payment right afterwards, to prevent having to make an extra stop at the check out station. So helpful!

I've gotten my nails done here 3 times now and was genuinely loving it. Marilyn is phenomenal- but her staff needs to get it together. I spend a lot of money here- regular customer, always tip well, promote them like crazy on social media. I came in today to have my nails fixed. After just 9 days- I had not one- not two, but FOUR cracked nails. All uniform cracks- CLEARLY an application issue. I got there at 4:45, sat down , and waited ten minutes for a nail
Tech. This is standard.

I'll try my best to keep this short. Saw 2 different nail techs- both asking what color I got. I didn't know. They were clearly in a huge rush- don't book me if you're in a rush. Picked a pink color that did not match my nails. I was asked three times if this was okay- and kept telling them no. I hated them. They looked horrible. When I went to bake my left hand again I realized the fourth of the four broken nails. The nail tech should have seen this- I shouldn't have had to point it out.""I don't have time to fix it"" thats fine. How about Friday? ""No"" Saturday? ""No"" Sunday! ?? ""We are closed""..... okay- so when are we going to fix this!? I tried to accommodate and just have a design or sparkle thrown on those nails- I wasn't given a choice. She just ran and got hideous silver sparkle paint. At this point- I was done. I'm not a kid- give me a choice. I'm a customer.

After all this- wrong nail color, rushing me, not providing options on how to accommodate- doing a terrible repair job, and overall extremely high stress appointment ... ""that will be 10 dollars.""

Excuse me!?! Absolutely not. I explained I don't feel comfortable spending 10 dollars on a FIX for a job that should've been done correctly the first time. ""***Okay- we will take it out of Marilyns paycheck then"" *** this was the final straw for me. How dare you make it the customers issue and make them feel guilty about expressing dissatisfaction in a service, and then say you are pulling it out of the employees check!? Unreal. The level of unprofessionalism was genuinely appalling. I'll never be back- I look for a relaxing experience- and nails that last longer than a week.

Located on 38th street, it's a nice restaurant that serves Nayarit style seafood, this place is packed everyday of the week but during the weekends you will definitely see entire families inside enjoying the great food and drinks this place has.

The parking lot is pretty big for a lot of cars and they also have a drive thru section if you're picking up food.

I wouldn't trust google images of the menu since its renovated and prices have changed, I was just here this first week of 2021 and saw the changes.

So when I got here I saw they ask you to wear a mask and that they have skipped a few tables to enforce social distancing, they ask everyone to wear a mask and if there's no table available at the moment they will write you down in their list but you will have to wait inside your car.

During weekends you might see some clowns around for the kids or even mariachi to entertain people while they eat, so be prepared for some noise if you plan on eating there.

I love ceviche and I have been to all Mexican restaurants in Indy and the reason I drive 22 minutes to eat at this place is because they serve a good amount of real ceviche and they don't try to make it look like it's a lot by adding more onion which is the thing with other places; here you will try real fish. Now, to properly eat this ceviche they have crunchy chips and a very spicy and tasty green sauce, be careful this will make you have a runny nose.

Now another thing that I love having here is shrimp cocktails and shrimp empanadas those are really tasty and when they serve empanadas they add a very creamy and spicy sauce on the side.

During my last visit the guy who was in charge of the list was very proactive and when they were about to give me my table he placed my order for food so it took less than 15 minutes to have the dish on my table, loved the service all waiters were taking good care of their tables.

I wish they would open another restaurant near downtown or broadripple.

Rather than handle us separately,we sat down and the glasses were set on the table in front of us, you know, like self serve. 

My wife had quite a time having her glasses adjusted, still not right, it's the nose pads. 

Yes, she is looking to see if they are level, using her face as the guide, and her eyebrows are part of her face and her eyebrows and her ears are even, so that's not the problem, and I didn't really think that the ""Are you going by your eyebrows?"" Comment was appropriate.

If it's not, please start putting marinara on your meatball sub or giving it on the side as it should not be a dry sandwich. Both of the sandwiches came with house made chips and pickles, and they were ""knock your socks off"" good!!! I was so impressed that they make their chips in house. So we definitely will be back to The Humble Hoagie. Some of the daily special sandwiches look incredible and are definitely on my radar to try. I do wish they offered some on the weekend as that's going to be the only time we're really able to go due to work schedules. We cannot wait to go back and eat The Humble Hoagie again!!

*Edited to add* they literally announced today that they're going to offer special sandwiches weekly instead of daily. So they'll be available on the weekends as well! This made my day! Seriously, go try them!!",2021-01-17 16:36:50,354,1650,

We were actually on our way to dinner, but I had to know what these Birria tacos were all about. I ordered one birria and my friend ordered the chicken taco. The lady who took our order was very friendly and helpful. Our food was ready in just a few minutes. Both tacos were great!  I was a little confused about my taco though. I thought the birria tacos came with a consommé. I was enjoying the flavors without it, so I didn't get out of the car to ask. Both of the hot sauces she provided were full of spice and flavor. 
The only drawback I have with this place is they don't offer chips and salsa. This is the only reason we went to a different restaurant to eat. If they offered chips and salsa we would've ordered our full dinner there. I asked if they were adding these to their menu and she said they're still figuring out what else they can add. Hopefully, they'll make the list. 
I'm from Texas originally and love homemade lemonada. They have it there, but it's not fresh. All of their other drinks are made from scratch though. She was kind enough to give us a sample of their Pina coladas and boy are they delicious!!!  You can order a few of those to go, get home and just add rum and ice. 
I will be back soon, as their location is at my local neighborhood produce market.

BQe1qwJsb9mgJwRda6ZdDg,LhezsHXeNVW4qMev7Qko4Q,QNdtui1f1DZklsGur_mwRw,1,1,0,1,"This review is so worth the read, here I list all the reasons of why The Highlands is the WORST apartment complex to try to live at as a UNR student. I was a resident here my sophomore year, had a rather difficult experience, but then proceeded to give it a second try my senior year. BIGGEST mistake I've made in my college experience. As a diligent business student, I haver learned exemplary things from the management at The Highlands on how NOT to run a business. 
I am so unbelievably frustrated with the management here. I feel bad for the  student employees who work at the front desk who have to feel the wrath of the other frustrated residents here, when they aren't the ones to blame- the upper management (assistant GM, GM, etc.) are the ones to credit for how this apartment complex functions. Considering how much myself and others pay for this apartment, my dryer has broken three separate times, my refrigerator twice and freezer ice maker once, my TV 9which was not fixed for 3 months into my lease), and my door lock (still not fixed after my request of 2+ weeks later). Now, this is not to blame the maintenance guys who work here, because they are constantly running around and working so hard to fix everyone's utilities, but to blame management for not taking our money and using it wisely towards actual products that don't constantly need fixing. 
The lack of good utilities isn't the only issue here- the management here can't even keep track of our money for rent! My roommate turned in a money order for her rent (which is practically cash at that point), and they shredded the money order without cashing it first, so when it was no longer valid they insisted that she re-pay, when it was CLEARLY their fault that her money order was no longer good to use. I would not trust this apartment with my money in their hands (cash, check, money order, etc.) because of their lack of responsibility. 
The mailing room here is also an open room with access to anyone who has an access code. During my sophomore year, they used to have a room where only the employees could access the packages and it was much safer to make sure the correct package got in the right hands. Now, they have decided that it is a ""better"" idea to have a mailing room where anyone can access all the packages as long as they have an access code, with the intent that they will grab their own package. Hate to break it to you, but not everyone in this world has good intentions. I ordered a package from a high-end company who's logo was on the outside of the package, to find later that it had been broken into and the packaging had been completely shredded. I was frustrated that the management here hadn't thought of the possibility of this package being stolen because there would be nothing I could do about it.
Might I add, that even after the hundreds of dollars that they charge for you to live here with half-working appliances and the half-ass service that you receive on the managers' end, they will charge you a $50 dollar fee if you don't have your keys and need to be let into your own bedroom? They mention their ""after-hours staff"" and how they are there for you and at your service after their office closes at 5 PM, yet they fail to mention that they plan to take another $50 dollars from you to turn a key to open a 2-inch thick door after hours. So much for ""being there for the residents"".  
This apartment complex is the WORST. The location isn't in the safest place ever, given that sometimes I can hear gunshots down the street, yet maybe I would feel safer if the gate that we pay for at the front of the complex ACTUALLY closed. I just can't add up enough reasons of why anyone should live here. This apartment complex is so not worth the money. I wish I had taken more time to think about my living choice for this year. With the pandemic I understand that people are scrambling to find somewhere to live for school, but I urge all UNR students- take this advice from me and DO. NOT. LIVE. HERE. There are better places with either the same price or less that would be much more worth your time, energy and money.",2021-01-27 03:58:31,854,4136,

Well, it was I, myself and me that suffered at this salon that claims it's an upscale men's salon. On the careers part of it's web page it says it's looking for ""smartly dressed stylists"". Google maps says I was there from 9:23 until 10:14am on Dec. 26th, 2020.


I,myself and me....  arrived a few minutes prior to my 9:30am appointment as requested by the confirmation e-mail sent prior to appointment. I walked in and there was a girl leaning on the counter in her PAJAMAS looking at her phone. She told us to sit and wait in the waiting lounge. My appointment time came and went while we sat there.


Finally about 10 minutes late the pajama girl enters the room and announces she's my ""stylist"". She tells me that morning she decided to wake up and head to work after brushing  her teeth but skipping combing her hair or getting dressed. SHOCKING!

She also mentions she had been fired  from another salon that I'd been to.


I should have ran for my hair's life but I asked her if she knew how to cut hair... ""yes"" she said. Easily the worst haircut/style I've ever had. I will have to wear a hat for 6 weeks and hope another stylist can repair the damage done. She never bothered to even out my sideburns or even cut hair near my sideburns. I have ""winglets"" that even a medium hold product can't hold down.

It is all outdated and very scummy. I would never, ever, again pay top dollar to stay in a ""high-end resort.""

Beginning with the outrageous wait times for the bars, the over crowded cesspools, the old, broken, wooden beach chairs, and the elevators appearing to be under construction. Perhaps they were just run down, I couldn't tell. Once we finally had a room, upon entrance, everything was outdated and we did not even have a single window, balcony, or view in the entire room. The wifi kept disconnecting and wouldn't stay connected for more than 3 minutes, the bathroom door wouldn't ever shut completely, there seemed to be little to no covid regulations, and there was absolutely no parking for guests in the late afternoon. It was too full. We attempted to ask front desk about a Valet service which was promoted, but due to covid they do not have the service all day and recommended parking down the street, far from the resort.

The cafe used to be a place where you could play card games and board games. It has always had excellent customer service and the drinks are always improving.

This year, during my visit, we ordered two drinks and a pastry. The drinks were:
- Cold Sakura Milk Tea with Boba
- Warmed Matcha Milk Cap Tea with Boba

The Sakura milk tea was a new and unique flavor to me! I have never tried it, and the best way that I would be able to describe it would be that it is a more floral drink. You can definitely taste the difference between that and a jasmine or black tea.

The warmed matcha milk cap tea with boba was amazing! It was just the right amount of sweetness and the milk cap was great. I definitely suggest this drink warmed because it has been quite chilly in St. Louis.

The boba in both drinks were chewy, sweet, and the perfect sized boba.

The pastry that we got was a custard filled bun, priced at $6.50. I found it to be a bit pricey for a custard filled bun. After one bite, it was definitely worth it. The bun was not hard, quite soft and fluffy. The custard instead was not too sweet too!

The staff is well accommodating and always wanting to hear your thoughts on how they can improve. For example, my matcha milk cap tea was missing boba, so they were quick to fix it and give me a cup of boba to add myself. They also wanted to hear our thoughts on the sweetness of the drinks, which shows me that they are wanting to evolve for their customers! Loved the atmosphere.

Another tip is how to get there! The signs are not in plain sight, but you have to look up when walking down Delmar! It's located above Snow Factory, so definitely take the stairs up to this Fun Cafe ;)",2021-01-26 17:15:10,395,1840,

I have only dropped items off at this Goodwill twice. I will never bring any items here again. There is a gentleman who works here who has been extremely rude to me on both occasions without provocation of any sort. The first time, other folks were dropping off items on a large table that was placed nearby the back drop off area which led me to believe this was where I should place my items as well. This man yelled at me in a disparaging tone of voice that items are only to be placed up on an elevated concrete surface where he was standing which was already completely covered with items and which was difficult to get to because there was a large pool of water blocking off much of the pavement near this surface. I brushed off his rudeness as him being busy and trying to keep the process orderly. I figured I'd be wiser the next time I brought some things and avoid any further trouble.

Today, when I brought items for the second time to this location, I came prepared - I thought, ""This will go well so long as I don't forget to put my boxes up on the thing."" I had a number of boxes with assorted stuff and one box which contained some Christmas ornaments. This same gentleman noticed this box as I was bringing it over and shouted, ""Are those Christmas ornaments!?"" (Clearly they were). ""Yes,"" I responded. ""NOT AFTER **DECEMBER**!"" He shouted back, again, in a condescending, scathing voice. Shocked at his tone, I turned around to take the items back to my vehicle. As I did, he shouts, ""NOT IN **OUR** DUMPSTER!!"" despite the fact that I had no intention of throwing anything in the dumpster - like I was some kind of uncouth jerk that goes around throwing things in other people's dumpsters.

On the surface, this is no big deal. There are way worse things going on in the world. But all I was trying to do was give the place some donations, some of which were relatively valuable. I'm not a professional Goodwill donation-giver. I had never done this before. I don't know the ""rules"" of making donations to this place which I don't even ask for tax deductible receipts from in return.

Maybe it's just because we've been in a pandemic for a year and the country feels like it's falling to pieces, but having someone shout and yell at you like you're a bad person while you're just trying to make some donations to a charity-oriented business is an experience I don't feel like having again, ever. I will not be back here again.",2021-01-09 17:41:40,540,2516,

I was visiting from out of town and forgot to pack my tweezers so,I made an appointment at EWC to get my eyebrows done on a whim. To preface this review, I will say I take great pride in my brows and will always do my research on a place or waxer before letting anyone new touch them. Needless to say I was in a rush and didn't think before booking. 
My waxing was pain-less and my waxer was very sweet, I just don't think she ever touched eyebrows before. When she handed me the mirror, I could not believe my perfect eyebrows were GONE!! I have always had thick brows with a minimal space in the center (the way I like it). My perfect eyebrows are now mere uneven lines of what they used to be and the shape I've spent 10+ years manicuring is completely destroyed. I now have an extremely large space between my eyebrows. I am not sure why anyone with any experience waxing eyebrows would not even follow the basic shape and rule of eyebrow shaping by removing a portion of someone's eyebrows from the center out. I was in absolute shock leaving and when I got to my car I had a full breakdown at what she had done to me. After some cooling down I called to complain about how awful the job was and request a refund, she took all my information (why she couldn't get it from my appointment IDK!) and was told the manager would be in touch - I will be waiting for their call. The woman at the front desk who I spoke with offered no apology and basically asked if I was just calling to complain or if I wanted something else - how about some empathy! I am so remorseful about my decision to go to EWC for my eyebrows, I have previously been to another location for a another wax appointment and had no complaints and also to this same location for a brow wax months ago and had a fine experience. 
My problem with this company is they don't hire estheticians, they employ people who can wax. I could be wrong, but to me, I do not believe these waxers have any formal beauty training that would be required to wax eyebrows or any other area of the body that requires precision. If this company cannot properly train all their waxers to handle the precision of an eyebrow wax, than do not offer the service or limit it to only employees that are trained. 
I have never felt the need to make such a negative review or ever request a refund for a service. However, I cannot let the carelessness of this waxer go without notice. I am horrified that I will be spending next 6+ months filling in my brows waiting for them to outgrow this horrifying experience.

My boyfriend and i made reservations here for Sunday Brunch at 10:30 am and requested to be outside while making the reservation. The day of (about 40 minutes prior to our reservation) we called saying we would be 10 minutes late, to which the hostess who picked up said it would be no problem. We got to Bud & Marilyn's 9 minutes late, where my boyfriend spoke to the maitre'd and she told him we were ""too late"". He explained the situation and even pulled out his phone to show we were only 9 minutes late (mind you most places give 15 minute grace period for reservations). The maitre'd said we were too late and refused to seat us, to which my boyfriend asked if they could seat us even an hour from now. The maitre'd said no and boyfriend said ""okay, no worries"" and we walked outside to figure out brunch plans on the corner of 13th and Locust. 
Low and behold they had an availability not even 15 minutes later for seating outside at 11 am when we looked on Open Table.  We took a walk around the block and we went inside (where they clearly remembered our faces) and said we had a reservation under our name for 11am. We checked in for our new reservation 5 minutes early and we told them we would be outside where they could find us. This is where I hope the maitre'd and the hostesses were just having a bad day.
When we turned around to go outside again they laughed at my boyfriend and i loud enough for both of us to hear. I assume they were embarrassed and had nothing better to do because we actually found an open reservation at the restaurant. They ended up seating us outside at the furthest table from the enterance and did not say sorry, nor did the maitre'd even admit to having messed up.

The food arrived so quickly, and they used a microwave, and a rice cooker to prepare the dishes. The food was horrible, and tasted like it was prepared well in advance. Today I'm suffering from indigestion and diarrhea. I have travelled to various areas of Spain, and this so called food (tapas) is a disgrace to the country. The owner, server, and artist harassed us the minute we sat down, during the meal, and as we were leaving at the door to purchase one of her overpriced (rose) paintings. We went for a nice casual meal, and the evening ended up as a disaster.  In reading the posted reviews, I question how valid they are, as I'm ready to call the health department regarding the food, and the owners adherence to the Covid 19 restrictions. The owner/server/artist and the cook were not wearing masks, there was no sanitizer available, and the utencils were not covered.  Believe me, this is definitely not a safe place to dine, and I advise everyone to stay away!

We had Nina as our bartender who was friendly and also did a great job  creating an off menu items when I specified that I wanted the botanist gin, creme de violette, and sea foam but gave creative freedom for the rest of the drink. I was impressed with what she came up with. Their normal cocktail menu is very interesting. The cachaca drink was a great presentation of cachaca. The candy drink was an interesting but very unique take on a sweet and sour Candy inspired drink. It was refreshing but sweet at the same time. The rim appears as normal sugar but is more like sour Candy sugar with the drink garnish with a peach ring. We also had her make a off menu spicy tequila drink with fresh jalapeño which she made quite spicy but was impressive none the less since most bartenders are afraid of spice and don't make drinks spicy or just add spicy liqueur which doesn't actually make it spicy. Their fries are a very large serving and were delicious accompanied by a unique ketchup and onion aioli. The nachos were very fresh and tasty topped with short rib! It was definitely loud on the noise side though and would not recommend going if you want to talk or an intimate date. For a craft cocktails, were missing a few standard liqueurs such as St Germaine, Chambord, Contreau although their menu did seem like it has a specific them in terms of how they design their drinks and the liquor/liqueurs they choose to use. Definitely a great craft cocktail find in the area, will be back.",2021-01-17 14:34:15,310,1572,

Y'all. It was. So.bad. Continue for a long, awful story of my worst dining experience ever. 

Walked it and the place was almost dead. Get to our table and a sweet note was there wishing me a happy birthday. 
Order an espresso and fries for the baby. My husband doesn't have a water and asks for one. 15 min later everything arrives. Apparently the espresso machine broke but is all better now. Fries are hot and well seasoned. Espresso is Luke warm, watered down drip coffee. I still truck on, that can't ruin my experience, we order our appetizer and entrees. 
Tuna tartare is our starter, it arrives like 15 min later. Looks like half dollar chunks on mushed avocado with two slices of radish on top, sitting in a pool of soy sauce-like I made something similar when I was in middle school. Still gonna give it a go- OMG i want to spit out ( and y'all I eat everything!) it was so salty it made my mouth pucker. I thought maybe if I mix it up? Even worse it was so salty I could not even try to choke it down. I chug my water. I had to send back, my first dish ever to send back. So bad, my heart sinks, this is going to be awful. 
My entree arrives a good 20 minutes afterwards (we arrived at 12:30 and finally got our food at 1:30). We had to ask our sever when the food was going to arrive, 5 minutes later she is bringing all of it out. As a previous server, I figure it has been sitting there under the hot lamps. I ordered the salmon Benedict, when the plate was in front of me I wanted to gag. Looked like salmon you get out of a bag at aldi (no hate, I shop there!) on top of ready made quinoa that you buy precooked at the grocery store and heat up for a quick lunch, with ""poached"" eggs on top with a drizzle of some pink sauce. It looked horrible, it tasted even worse. Quinoa tasted just like it looked, out of a pouch. The salmon had to have been dragged through the same salt lick as the appetizer and when the egg was pierced not even a dribble of yolk. The sauce had to have been a scant 1/4 tsp of spicy Mayo (supposed to be hollandaise). To make matters worse it was all just barely lukewarm. Y'all I couldn't eat it, it was so repulsive. I wanted to vomit. And I had no water to try and wash it down. 

Hubby order chicken and biscuits, they were so dry I wanted to cough just looking at them. He couldn't even choke his down. He said disgusting. 
My MIL ordered a medium filet (I know, I know) for her salad and it came out well done. The salad was so soggy , I can just imagine it dying under those lamps. The dressing on her salad was eatable so she graciously shared with me. 
We were just so stunned that a dining experience could be so bad. Horribly slow and inattentive service, absolutely inedible, thoughtless food. 
I believe we tried to leave as fast as we could because my mother in law was about to lose it. We packed up all the crap, I just wanted this experience to be over, so fast. I wanted to also get out of there before my mil went to talk to the manager(they have been there 4 times before and had A great experience, I can't believe that) 
She spoke with the acting manager, turns out our server was the bartender also, which explains the slow pacing of things and the general manager was not there. 
The absolute worst dining experience of my life. Ever. And I love to eat and I couldn't find one saving grace for this place. With what we experienced today this place will absolutely shut down. Do NOT waste your time or money here.
ETA: the acting manager did offer a refund, but my mil did not take it and said she just wanted to talk to the GM. That conversation should happen today.",2021-01-25 12:38:49,855,3843,

Mi Amor and I walked in together (we used valet to park) and made our way up the staircase to the restaurant. Unfortunately we weren't greeted when we first got there (3 people standing there nobody said anything, a smidge awkward) within a min a lady came from around the corner and greeted us. She looked up our reservation asked us what we were celebrating (love ‍) and took us to our seats!

The place has a very romantic ambience and great booths for that private enjoyment. We didn't get a booth (my fav) but it was cool bc Mi Amor hates them anyway.

Mi Amor tried to the charred Ceasar salad and it delicious! I loved the charred smokey taste on the lettuce. We both had the aged steak and for sides had sweet potatoes, macaroni and cheese, and braised greens. The braised greens were by far my fav side! They were amazing!!!! I would def order those again. I was disappointed the sweet potatoes were mashed but I think that was my misreading (lol) they were still delicious and flavorful. 

The drinks we ordered were also on point! I had the lemon basil and it was too good! It was definitely one of those drinks you have to pace yourself so you don't drink too many.

I would highly recommend trying to place out if you're down and wanting to steak. It's def my fav steakhouse downtown although if I'm going for steak and spending those prices.......go to Eddie Merlot's.",2021-01-19 23:56:48,333,1559,

After searching for a photographer for family, maternity, and newborn pictures, I found Woodmancy Photography and I fell in love with her portfolio. I submitted a request directly through her website and Alexa responded very quickly with all the information I needed to know I chose the right person. She included upfront session details, prices, and her upcoming availability. A couple quick emails back and forth and we were booked for a maternity/newborn package for the upcoming arrival of our 2nd daughter. 

Alexa was great to work with and super flexible on dates. We needed to reschedule our early November maternity/family session due to weather and our newborn session also needed to be moved since our daughter arrived early. We booked a lifestyle session for our newborn pictures in our home and I decided last minute that I also wanted to do a session at her studio which she gladly accommodated the next day! Our sessions were the week before Christmas so I was incredibly impressed at how flexible and accommodating she was! 

During the actual shoots, Alexa was calm, friendly and patient as we tried to get our rambunctious 2-year old to cooperate. I'm so grateful for how helpful and professional she was during the whole process. She had great posing suggestions and the pictures turned out absolutely beautiful.

For all 3 sessions, we received our pictures within a couple weeks of the shoot. We even did our 2 newborn sessions right before Christmas and she sent our pictures before New Years Eve even though one of these was also a last minute add on!! 

I will definitely be using Alexa again!",2021-01-08 04:41:49,302,1644,

It has a very nice rooftop location with a stringer light illuminated green lawn area facing south and outdoor dining facing west for those sunset views. If you wanted to hang out at the green lawn area, you can order drinks and/or takeout food at the outside counter. Otherwise, you can go inside to be seated in the restaurant.

My first drink was the lavender field cocktail. It was good, but a bit small for $16. All cocktails are $16 which is a bit pricey for what I've been tasting. I also had the rose colored glasses cocktail. I was not a fan of the taste at all, but it was very pretty. The prices overall were a bit unnecessarily high for what was offered. For example, the average glass of wine is approximately $12-$15.

The chicken meatballs were delicious! I had a taste of one of my friends mushrooms and would totally get those for myself, if I come here again next time. The six burger was good. The fries were OK. However, the pickle was nasty. The pickle that came with the burger did not taste like a pickle at all. The pickle tasted like they watered it down for 24 hours or more.

Additional note, I had a tab open at the counter then got seated in the restaurant and forgot to close it there so I told the waitress about it and was told there was nothing she could do about it. I had to close that tab separately instead of her just doing it which was a bit weird. 

The overall experience was good due to the company I kept and a pretty place to take photos.",2021-01-29 12:56:42,361,1689,

The food was cooked properly temperature wise. The mashed potatoes were bland & thick. I like more creamy mashed potatoes. The meats didn't really have any flavor. A little cracked sea salt before cooking could've helped. Not sure if all servers add the simple syrup for guests, ours did. I'm black southerner so.... yea I needed a lot more  he brought out another serving of it and I just didn't drink any until I finished eating because it wasn't sweetened enough. However, our waiter was kind enough to give us refills when we were leaving and I was able to sweeten it at home. 

The ambience was very sterile and very ""business lunch."" Not really the vibe for a date night or meal with the kids. The person that suggested it to us said it would be like Hou-----. It definitely was nice 

From what I saw on other tables- the portion sizes for everything is pretty decent. The salads were stacked high for sure. The pasta serving bowl appears small but after watching a neighboring table eat, it seemed like they packed a good portion size in. 

There are multiple sauces to get but the bacon vinaigrette was uniquely tasty! 

Overall, I'd come back if I'm in the area. It's not a place I'd leave home with the intentions of going to. I'd more than likely reorder the steak medium rare and seasoned/ salted (instead of the medium tonight that my mom had) with some potatoes and just hopefully have my own seasoning in the car to use and ask for a few helpings of butter and chives/ have them load the mashed potatoes. Probs would make it 100 times better. I'd also try the smoked salmon Since I didn't see anyone with it tonight.",2021-01-27 08:12:49,361,1738,

This morning we woke up to a cold 50 degree house because Harris does not deliver on time. We are on automatic delivery and paid for our oil a year in advance. There is still a  $800 credit on my account and when I called at 7:30am I was told Mr. Harris would return my call when he gets into the office. He called at 12:30 and told me that his apology should be enough. 

I explained my concern is that anything that was laying in the bottom of my tank could require my furnace to stop working and costly repairs. I have an automatic delivery contract with him so that it never runs out. He said if it breaks, he will fix it. And I added, and you will bill me when you are the one that caused the damage. I requested a free contract for repairs if the draining of my tank causes my furnace to break. He said he wouldn't do that. He said his apology should be enough and I am one of those people that always asks for more and that he and his wife have COVID (not sure what that has to do with anything). I told him my husband had to run out to the hardware store and get what he needed to bleed the line because they drained the tank. Thank God my husband knows how to do this or I would have had to pay someone to do it. Mr. Harris thought that was funny.  He laughed.

I told him I am one of his best customers that pays ahead and this is the service I got. He then offered 20% off of his premium contract  for repairs, the contract costing me $360. I said, no thank you. His reluctance to take responsibility for any damage done to my furnace due to their poor service is a fair warning to others who seek fuel oil. Mr. Harris touted his 70 years in business. I don't know what kind of service people expect, but when I have a contract for automatic delivery and pay thousands of dollars months ahead of use, I do not expect to run out. And if my furnace stops working due to their negligence, they need to be responsible for it.

Buyer beware! Go elsewhere for fuel oil.",2021-01-15 18:27:03,447,2079,

Unfortunately, it was just an average meal, which in the end, left me kinda sad. From pictures, you can tell the courtyard is an amazing spot - brick, lights, fountains, tree canopy - the works. The interior is a little colder, with far less personality. I'd be even more disappointed with the overall experience if I was inside.

Aside from the great setting outside, the service was great - laid back, but very friendly and helpful. The food and eating part of the experience was unremarkable though. I had contacted them in advance to accommodate a vegetarian, which isn't always easy in New Orleans. They assured me they'd have a chef's selection vegetarian risotto available. Unfortunately, we were there on a slow night and they were ""all sold out"" of risotto. Yeah, uh-huh. So instead we had to settle for the typical veggie pasta, which was just ok.

I had the catfish dish with crab, and it was pretty sad. Especially for the premium price. The catfish was OK - nothing special, but the dish was severely lacking crab meat. It was so little they shouldn't even include it, as it was literally a few chunks (literally 1 tablespoon!) hidden under the fish. Overall, it was just ok - underwhelming is probably the right word. Dessert was also just ok. We ordered caesar salads that were supposed to be prepared tableside and instead they just brought them out to us. Kinda defeated the point of paying that price for it. Decent beer list, with a few local IPA's and decent cocktails.

I would said it is about three and half star. Flooring selection is better deal than others with same thickness and mill of the plank. But if you have existing condition, they may not able to accommodate. Basically I said if you original concrete floor conditions has perfect elevation or you just need to change the carpet to plank, they are your people. 

What they offer. 
Some plank has life time warranty and some has limited warranty. They will offer to move large pieces furniture, installation, edging molding, and transition pieces. 

What not offer. 
Adjust due to existing condition, painting on molding. 

The contractor followed the guideline of COVID if they are too close to you. They help moving the large furniture which is convenient to the home owner. They do have good selection. However the call back for punch list item to finish off take too long and wait. Overall their value of the plank is good quality. We install the Nuvelle 20 mils 5.5 mm thick luxury vinyl plank. Our color was the seaside pecan. I like the plank has minor texture and not cold when you step on during winter. 

I would suggest any home owner before visit do their homework on the plank. You really don't want a plank holding at end edge and deflect a lot. Minimum mil need to be 12 mil and minimum thickness should be at least 5 mm. Most home bedroom is 5 mil surface and kitchen is 12 mil. Most commercial restaurants use 20 mil to avoid surface broken.

After every item he'd ask me if I was done.  He put me on hold, and never took me off hold in the 5+ minutes it took me to get to the restaurant.

The night desk clerk was on top of explaining my charges answering my questions before I could even ask them. Josh ""Moose"" the morning desk clerk was helpful in giving us directions and helping us find everything we needed. Give the man a bonus he is doing a great job and makes your hotel look hospitable.

I had about a 35 minute wait, which I sat in the car due to the cold.    Once inside, all of the booths are separated by a Plexiglas divider and you can either get a paper menu or scan for the digital menu.    I loved using the digital menu but I did end up also using the paper menu my friend had.    

Our server was amazing.  She did not rush us at all and even encouraged us to sit as long as we like to catch up.   I had the vanilla chai tea latte and my friend got the dirty chai latte.  I did not try hers but she said it was very good and mine was delicious.

   The food was great. I don't remember which omlette my friend got but she was very happy with her food and I got the shakshuka which was delicious!  It was the first time I have heard / tried it and it was so good, definitely a new favorite  breakfast item.  I want to learn how to make it myself.

You can pay with apple pay, google pay and venmo.   LOVE IT.   Also, it gave three options when paying.

We came in a little before 8 on a Friday night and there were at least 4 other groups in the restaurant eating. They were pretty busy which was nice to see. We decided to come here because we wanted to support a local business during covid. We got in line behind another couple to order and the girl taking orders yelled back to the kitchen ""We got another one!"". I'm guessing they were annoyed that we came in around 10-15 minutes before closing... it all went downhill from there. We ordered our food and asked the girl if it was ok for us to sit down and eat. We promised her we'd be quick and she responded with ""Sure take as long as you'd like!"". She forgot to give us our soda cup so we had to ask her for that which seemed like an inconvenience for her. We filled up our soda and sat down to wait patiently for our order. Another girl came out from the back and was working vigorously to close the shop down. She seemed very annoyed that people were still in the restaurant. She turned off all the tvs and continued with her closing duties while obnoxiously yelling random things back to the kitchen to show everyone in the restaurant her displeasure of us being there. This girl ended up bringing us our order. She dropped it off quickly all packaged up in to go containers and tied in a plastic bag. She said ""Have a good night!"" very dismissively and quickly took off to the back of the store without asking us if we needed anything else. This was a surprise because the other girl said we could eat in the store... we got the hint and wanted to try to get out of there as quickly as possible since we were starting to feel uncomfortable. We checked our bag and there were no sauces for our food which all require bbq sauce. I walked up to the counter and the girl was counting money. I waited patiently for the right time to ask her for some sauce and when she got to a point where she was done counting I said ""excuse me? Sorry to interrupt you but could we get some sauce?"" and she responded with a very loud obnoxious ""what's up?!"" that got everyone in the restaurants attention. After some quick back and forth communication she got me a chipotle sauce and two bbq sauces. The whole exchange made me feel pretty embarrassed and I felt stupid for even asking for sauce even though non of our sandwiches had bbq sauce on them so it was necessary to get some in order to actually enjoy the food. I walked back over to my wife and put the sauces in the bag and noticed that there weren't any utensils. I asked my wife to go request them because I was too worried my head would've been chewed off if I bugged the girl again for something that we truly needed now that we were going to eat in the car. So my wife bravely ventured back to the girl and requested utensils. The girl was a little less aggressive toward my wife and my wife safely made it back to me with our food eating weaponry. We rushed out of there quickly and ate in the car. Now on to the food. The tri tip sandwich my wife got was just ok and so was the macaroni but I got the Meat Hook and that thing was amazing! I've ordered it here before and once again it didn't disappoint. The sweet potato fries with the chipotle sauce were bomb as well!

The dining room is also nice, although now that our kids are grown we love to sit at the bar.  Ironically, we don't usually like to sit at the bar most places we go, but for some reason we really enjoy this one.  And a big plus was that the bartender remembered us from one time to the next, even though our visits are usually about six months or a year apart. 

(Note: Sitting at the bar to dine is currently unavailable due to the pandemic, but put it on your list to do once it reopens!)

Charleston's has one of my all-time favorite appetizers, the Shrimp Cargot. It's just like it sounds -- similar to Escargot, but with shrimp instead of snails. It's served in an Escargot dish, with the separate compartments each containing butter, garlic, and an individual shrimp, and it's topped with a copious amount of melted Havarti cheese.

Another menu item of note is their Famous French Dip, which is the best French Dip sandwich I've ever had. It's really more like a thin-sliced prime rib dinner served on a French roll.

Their Hand Cut Filet (7oz) is also excellent. That's my usual go-to meal there. I get it medium rare, with fries on the side to dip in the juice (instead of the usual vegetable medley side). The prime rib dinner is good, too. And if you're in the mood for soup, try the Baked Potato Soup. It's very good.

To me, Charleston's has an upscale vibe with small-town friendliness. I've found both the Castleton and Westfield locations to be this way. It's a little pricier than many of the restaurants in the area, but well worth it.",2021-01-08 23:16:12,368,1676,

After trying many places, with varying results we really found a spot that just nails it for our two different tastes. (take out is a very different animal than dine in we've learned) :-o. Looking for a portable meal for a picnic lunch near the waterfront, I opted for the Finney's BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich: Slow roasted pork, house-made bbq, crispy onions, corn on a brioche bun. I really appreciate what I call the ""modern"" or ""West Coast"" style pulled pork sandwich that uses crispy onions, sometimes cheese, but eschews any other sauces (mayo, special sauce) and does NOT feature cole-slaw (though there was a small tub of it to add for the traditionalist :-). Eating the sandwich from the to-go tub was actually a blessing as they didn't skimp on the BBQ sauce and brioche bun really soaked it up, the knife & fork pack was a welcome addition :-) The addition of corn on the sandwich was an interesting add and, for me good addition but YMMV on that one. My wife, on the other hand opted for the Asian Ahi Salad : Mixed greens, seared Ahi, mandarin oranges, carrots, peppers, pea sprouts, onions, tofu, cucumber, basil, ginger miso vinaigrette. OMG she raved about this one, cleaning out every scrap of the decent sized to-go container. Ahi was great, miso dressing was excellent and even the tofu garnered praise! We both swore we'd go back for the same things next time for sure. We've found our to go joint in downtown SB for sure :-)",2021-01-20 02:52:57,338,1552,
r0VPtrSBO6-TAtsNvOFXaw,4TPAlKZjhBo4vn1rq7MtCw,1q3cytWb6NP7scRnzWDyOw,1,8,0,1,"Maybe our experience has been different than the others because it was a large order (almost every single window in our house needed to be repaired), but when paying a company a whopping 35k, I expect much better. They started working on our home in August 2019, and we had quite a few issues, so get ready for a long, detailed review:

- It took them a month longer to come out than their projected start date, but when they finally did come out, I will say all the workers were incredibly friendly. We had like 5 of them out here, and every single one was very polite. However, their workmanship was a different issue. They broke a window, and realized they mis-measured another one previously, so that meant more waiting for the new windows to come in, and another appointment.

- They DRILLED A HOLE into our new wood flooring and scratched it up in multiple places due to not using drop cloths or anything, and left loads of drip marks all over the new windows. 

- Windows (and exterior DOORS), were left wide open, sometimes all day. They would leave for lunch, and also leave doors to the outside just completely wide open. The amount of flies, bees, and just random insects in the house was incredible. 

- When they came back to replace the broken window, they didn't have the other mis-measured one yet. It had been 2 weeks, and when I called to ask about it, they said it would be ANOTHER 2 weeks. I honestly doubt it was ever ordered in the first place, and I think my call was their reminder to order it. 

- Before they completely finished the work, they strong-armed me into giving them the final payment. I told them I didn't want to, because the work wasn't complete, but they pressured me to. Forcing final payment and pressuring your client before the work is completed, is flat-out wrong, and very unprofessional. 

- They always say, ""well call you to schedule"", but never do. They had to come out here 4 separate times (a few days for the initial work, and the other 3 were to fix their mess-ups), and I always had to call them to schedule it myself because they never called me to do it themselves. 

- After all this, we went to open our new windows on a cooler fall day, and one literally almost fell completely out. This meant they had to come out again, and I was told by the owner that they would check all the other windows when they came out to fix this one. 

- After fixing the window mentioned above, the 2 workers walked around the house to check all the other windows as promised, but they lied, and didn't check them all. They chose to walk around as if they were checking them all, then lie to me saying they did, when really, I know for a fact that they didn't.

- A few weeks later, we noticed they missed a window that needed repairing when doing the initial quote for everything. The owner came out, took a look, said, ""yeah, we missed that one"", and wanted $1700 for it. The issue is that we bought this house, and since it was missed in the initial quote 5 months earlier, the sellers won't have to pay for it anymore, WE would, because of Glass Guru's mistake. We definitely are going elsewhere to get that missed basement window fixed, and the quote to fix it was HALF of what glass guru was asking. 

- 3 months later, we found out that one of the windows they worked on was leaking a ton of water when it rained. They came out a week later to take a look at it, and the guy said there was literally NO caulking done at all on it, so, yeah...that was obviously the issue. How do you just not caulk/seal a window? 

- A few months pass...and this time, we notice that wood is bulging/twisting out of the frame on one of our kitchen windows that they worked on, so then we looked around at all the other windows, and found LOTS of cracking in the corners, mold, and more places where windows weren't caulked.

All of this is just ridiculous, and terrible workmanship, and I worry what other issues will come up in the future. Again, for a bill that is as high as 35k, anyone would, and SHOULD expect much better work.",2021-01-04 20:44:32,878,4062,

Our good friends suggested we go to dinner on NYE, and this was the only place with an opening later in the game. 

The space is attractive enough. About 3/4 of tables were occupied. 

Our friends were there already when we arrived. Even before our coats were off menus were put in our place settings. We barely said hello to our friends and the waitress was anxiously asking if we wanted a different beverage. I asked for iced tea and was told ""I'll check"". Ok... weird but ok. We were chatting about being hungry. We ordered antipasto for table. Instantly the house salad arrived. We didn't even place any orders yet. It was perplexing. The salad was teeny-tiny and just ok. Before I could even start the salad the waitress was trying to take orders. Mind you, no more than FIVE minutes had since elapsed since our arrival. Our friend told her to come back. Jeez. The bread bowl was four small flat slices of bread with some sort of seasoning. It was ok but for four people be a little more generous. The antipasto arrived and was lovely and tasty. My friend was still eating his portion and there was still some on the serving platter and the waitress started to take it all away. What?! Craziness. But we ordered our entrees and asked for more bread. Yay for four more tiny slices. Nice interim ensued as we chatted to our friends who we haven't seen in months. Entrees arrived. It was all tasty. Pastas for all in one form or another. They were good BUT so incredibly overpriced. I've had better quality and better service at half the price. The jar of cheese with plastic lid that was plonked onto the table was tacky. No attention to detail, nothing special, no freshly ground cheese, no freshly ground black pepper. These things are normally not necessary but the ridiculous boost of the entrees warrant something a touch better. After dinner my friend emphatically requested very hot, fresh coffee. Hot hot burning coffee. We both got warm coffee. Not hot. The server did replace the coffee but still. Do it right the first time. Dessert was a nice slice of chocolate cake. Expensive and touted as gigantic, it was merely a nice regular old slice of cake. Tasty but not amazing. Desserts are uninspired. Whole place feels uninspired. 

All in all, not terrible, not great. I can say I've tried it, but I don't think we'll return. There are better places everywhere. They need to up their game or reduce their costs. And not rush their patrons through what should be a pleasant holiday meal. I gave it 3 stars but really it's more like 2.5.",2021-01-01 18:04:09,565,2719,

I got a piña colada and a Texas quesadilla - sounds so simple, but made so well. So many options here that make me want to come back and try it all! 

FOOD 

Texas Quesadilla - I RECOMMEND 

Doesn't just look good, it IS good. A slight kick of spice and the steak, shrimp, and chicken were perfectly cooked meaning it was NOT dry. Mmm so flavorful. I ordered an extra side of rice (wasn't really needed for me but I can enjoy later. May want to try putting some in the quesadilla if you like rice.) 

Also, we started off with chips & salsa and a side of queso. So good. I like their salsa it actually taste like decent salsa (I've had bad tasting salsa before due to spices and consistency. Not theirs, es bueno.) 

I only eat until I'm not hungry while out so I definitely had to take a box to go because it's a full big plate. Only ate about a quarter of it at the restaurant but so grateful I get to enjoy it later today too. Condiments/salsa were packaged in separate condiment containers.

COVID-19 Protocols 
Social distancing & mask were enforced, and there is also a hand sanitizer station right at the door for all customers. 

Bathrooms were clean & fully stocked.

I heard such great things about it was described pretty similar to  the well-known Houston's here in New Orleans. Metairie has 2 location. We ended up selecting the newest location of the 2 which recently opened in Elmwood in a prime location. Plenty of parking.
Hosted a party of 5 for a birthday party. Greeted by wonderful hostesses the door. Chill-low key ambiance.
Now before I get into the food, I wanna make a note that I called ahead to see if they had a kids menu and if there was an age limit in which it was told ""No.""
Getting to being sat and being greeted by our server Cecilia whom seemed either a fairly new server or just plan nervous. Either way, she was not in her element as it would be expected in this type of establishment. Upon a few of the individuals ordering drinks, multiple drinks were made incorrectly and/or wrong liquor used within the drink ordered. On one of my guest orders a French 75 that 1st came out completely wrong, then after getting the replacement it came out hot. Another guest order a Prosecco that came out warm and had re-ordered another one that the server never brought out. A drink was also ordered by a guest that she wanted made with Cognac. The server then stated tol her that the drink is only made with Gin in which my guest replied it can be made either with Gon OR Cognac in which the server stated, here we only make it with Gin. Now, mind you, the person ordering the drink is a well-known bar tender at G.W. Finns. The server then refuted and stated she would ask someone in which came back and advised it would be made with cognac. It seemed the server was more trying to ensure she was trying to possibly follow rules instead of ensuring the customers were taken care of.
Food and appetizers were ordered. Apps for those that ordered came out well.

It was time for main food meals to be ordered. With me being on a intermediate carb fast, in ordered from the kids menu to ensure I control my portions not over-eat. About 3 minutes or so later after taking our order, the server returned and stated her manager told her that the kids menu is only for those ages 10 and lower and/or only IF You order 2 or more items. I advised I called up to the restaurant prior to arrival and asked and was told it would be ok to order from kids menu and also that it does not have an age limit listed no where on the menu AND the fact that she took my order initially as if it was not an issue. She seemed to have no remorse and pretty made it aware that was no deviation from what she was told, which forced me in to ordering a larger meal portion. When food order was placed, the actual meals came within what seemed to be 7-10 minutes which was fantastic! The 2 food-runners were very welcoming and handled placing the food correctly to everyone.

Food presentation was fantastic and it even tasted as good as it looked. The best thing about it all was everyone got hefty portion sizing. I was soo surprised with my ribs and ENORMOUS house salad. Having so much food but it not being heavy to make you have the feeling of over-eating/stuffing yourself was the #1 consensus that everyone agreed they loved.
Now after receiving our courses, the server didn't come back to the table until about 20 minutes afterwards and she legit just looked and then walked off without asking how everything was or if anything was needed. 
The food was great,  great atmosphere, the server Cecelia on a scale of 1-10 would be rated a 3 as she seemed disinterested in ensuring that the table had a great experience, which is a key component, i.e: checking in on table, asking how everything is going, making suggestions, knowing the menu, offering solutions to problems that was caused by either her or the kitchen/bar, etc...",2021-01-01 05:32:22,774,3839,

I typically order my food and beverages via Toasttab.com. The issue I have is simple to remedy. Whichever beverage I order is always annotated with ""Extra Hot"" in the comments. However, when there is also food in the order, the Barista makes the beverage almost immediately and sits it on the counter. Hence, the drink begins to cool down immediately. Meanwhile, it takes the grill cook 5-10 minutes to finish the food portion of the order. I specifically mentioned my concern (while holding my now cooling hot beverage) and waiting 5 more minutes for the food) that they might consider making food first AND THEN making hot beverages near or at the end, whenever a beverage is annotated as ""Extra Hot"" on the ticket. The Barista (""CBD C"" on my receipt) glared at me and then moved on with her next customer. Of note: they are hardly ever busy at this location during the late morning, especially at 10am when I visited. In fact, only one other customer was even in the store during my visit. Therefore, what I suggest is not unmanageable or unrealistic, especially during non-peak times. Think about it folks... Plus, my walk to French Truck is under 2 minutes, so tardiness is not a factor. 

My order included chai latte (extra hot), cafe au lait (extra hot), Build-a-biscuit, an almond croissant (warmed), and, a Caprese chicken sandwich (pressed). The biscuit and the sandwich were hot. Unfortunately, the ""warmed"" croissant was prepared at the same time as the drinks and all were lukewarm by the time the food was ready. Everything tasted fresh and delicious. It's just the temperature of the beverages that was not acceptable. It's an easy fix.",2021-01-28 17:06:23,379,1833,

No wonder they only received 1-star reviews since May 2020. Try your best to avoid this place. Completely disaster. The receptionist ""Marcy"" should get fired 100 times already. 

St Mary's Animal Clinic in Tucson is the most incompetent clinic I ever encountered. 

I brought my 6 years old Papillion there for a very basic health check in order to complete a health report for the pet insurance enrollment. I've done this every year in the past 6 years in other cities, it's usually quick and simple. 

I went to the appointment on 1/7 (TUR) at 9:00 AM. It took less than 5 minutes and the front desk lady told me the Doctor did not have the report yet and will send me later on that day. I did not hear anything from them for 3 days. 

On 1/11 (Mon) morning,  I called them again to request the report. The front desk staff ""Marcy"" said the doctor did not have a chance to prepare the health report and asked me to call them back later. I called them at noon, and before they close. Still no response.  

It's such a basic health report, I was shocked it took them 4 full days to prepare. Again, no email, no contact, no explanation. 

I called them again on 1/12 (Tue) morning. The doctor still did not do anything. Now, 5 days passed. Still waiting! What a chaotic, poorly managed place. I will never be back to St Mary's Animal Clinic again. 

I heard rumours that dog waked up in the middle of their procedures in St. Mary's Animal Clinic. I doubt any of the staffs there except the doctor had any actual veterinarian training. It gives me a very unprofessional, mom and pop shop vibe.  

I would recommend everyone try your best to avoid this place. Do not risk your pets' lives in such incompetent hands. 

As of now 1/12 (TUE) afternoon, still no responses, no health reports. I will just keep waiting and leave a back review every day until it got solved.",2021-01-12 20:40:07,417,1945,

My group decided to try the Churrasco Experience that included the Market Table and the Feijoada Bar. The Market Table was covered in a variety of vegetables, meats, cheeses, salads, and fruits. You could probably fill up on the Market Table very easily, but that would be a rookie mistake as you want to keep yourself hungry until the Gauchos start making their way to your table with the main course, meat! 

With the Churrasco experience, you get to try around 14 different types of beef, pork, chicken, and lamb. Be sure to ask for small portions of each until you find a few you really like because you will get full super quickly otherwise. In the past at Fogo, our server mentioned that they had medallions that had a green and red side to signal to the Gauchos if you wanted more food or if you wanted to take a break. When we visited, they did not have these medallions and that presented an issue in itself. It felt like I was being asked if I wanted a different cut of meat every two minutes which made it difficult to have a conversation that wasn't interrupted with those in my party. They really should figure out a different way to signal this as it got very irritating as the meal went on.

After trying all of the different cuts, the Filet Mignon and the Fraldinha ended up being my favorite. The meat was cooked perfectly each time it was brought to our table and it was just the right temperature to take a bite out of: not too hot, not too cold. Pair the meats with a refreshing Caipirinha or two, and you'll have the most satisfying, meat inundated meal of your life.

Though we didn't end up trying their signature dessert, the Papaya Creme, the Creme Brûlée was fantastic! 

I would definitely go here again for a special occasion, but wouldn't return just for a regular weekday. Another caution, be prepared to fork over a pretty penny at the end of this meal. Though the meats are good, if you aren't the ultimate carnivore this place may not be for you!",2021-01-07 15:54:32,434,2123,

When you walk in, it's just as intimate as pictured, kinda wish I was with my man & not my best friend .I started with some cocktails versus wine this evening,I tried the figgy thyme & I found my thrill. They have a pretty great cocktail menu, with a range of options. I enjoyed both drinks and the alcohol in them was well balanced. We started with the roasted cauliflower which has green curry yogurt, raisins and shallots. Then the octopus was whispering my name as it usually does. This one was served with citrus chili glaze, and a potato and olive petatou. I order octopus every where I go, because no matter how much I try it, I love the see every restaurants interpretation of it. Harper garden should really stay far away from octopus, it was bland, pre-cut (but not plated well) & I was not a fan of the petatou. The cauliflower was pretty mediocre as well. For entree we had jerk chicken with beans & a peach haberno glaze. I had the ""Mercia burger"" which was a Wagyu beef patty w/ cheese & fixing on a milk bread bun. OMG THAT BURGER!!! That burger was so damn good. I can never finish a whole burger because my eyes are always bigger than my stomach, but I damn near licked the plate. The jerk chicken was tender, flavorful and melted in your mouth each bite. The entrees def made up for the apps. So dessert was going to be the final determining factor. We got eggnog creme brûlée and mini apple pie. The creme brûlée was overcooked not really that creamy custard your looking for. The apple pie was just basic which really disappointed me because after they bodied that burger I just knew American food was their specialty. It's no doubt that I will be back for drinks and burger, but that's probably it. Such a cute vibe and our server was so attentive.

I had been having some problems with screen protectors bubbling up and falling off after about a week or so. I had this issue in the past and it had been a warp or miss balanced screen(or glass) so I asked for them to replace or lift the screen and rebalance it so my protectors would stop falling off. I was told no because there wasn't any physical cracks so they would not do that unless I called Apple and had Apple specifically place an appt and state they(Simutek) could replace the glass. I did this in the parking lot since they had appts for the same day... I walked back inside and spoke to whom I believe is the manager. He also stated since in the ""inspection"" they didn't find a warp, that they were still refusing to do the work I specifically called Apple to make an appt for. I felt like I was getting run around since I have AppleCare+ and T-Mobile insurance. This manager also stated since I had to come to them it must be because it was ""The last resort"" even though our Apple Store is temporarily closed.

1 - When we got to the security checkpoint no one was paying attention to social distancing. There was a sign but no one reminding people to observe the stickers that were on the ground. It was at this point my wife said, ""This might have been a bad idea."" But we hoped this was only because it was the very front of the park and there wasn't a lot of room.
2 - We walked back to SheiKra and started noticing people not wearing masks while walking through the park. SkeiKra was closed so we decided to take the train around to Cheetah Chase.
3 - No one was observing the stickers on the ground for social distancing and there was no one asking people to observe it. They were just standing off to the side in front of the station.
4 - We got into line at Cheetah Chase. We had to wait in a line outside the entrance where no one was observing social distancing.
5 - When we entered the line the young woman at the front didn't remind us to stay on the stickers or keep our masks on. She simply said, ""Go ahead.""
6 - We waited in line for an hour with NO ONE following safety protocols. I have two pictures and a video to prove this. We tried to be mindful of the people in front of us but the people behind us were inches away, even touching us at times.
7 - There were multiple people who were not wearing masks in line.
8 - There was no reminder coming over the intercom while we were in line that reminded people of social distancing or wearing a mask.
9 - There was no one going through the line making sure people were social distancing or wearing their masks.
10 - Even when we got to the front, the employees ignored people getting on the rise not wearing masks! 11 - After we got off the ride we walked around to other rides and every single line had the same issues.

We entered the park around 11:30am, by 3:30pm we were already leaving because of the issues above.
I have reached out to their customer service number who told me that there was absolutely nothing I could do. I used the pass and it was done. I left work early on Friday to go to the park and talk to customer service who told me they had the ability to refund customers stripped away because there had been so many similar complaints but gave me an email, BGA.GuestInformation@BuschGardens.com , but told me messaging the park on Facebook messenger was the best way to actually speak with someone. He was right but after explaining it again to them about these issues and asked for a refund because they are not following the protocols that they promised people. You don't know that they are lying on their webpage until after you visit the park, and even if you walk in and then walk out because you see that they are not following their own safety protocols they will only give you back 50% of your purchase because you have used your pass.

We have not needed to see a vet her in St. Pete, as we have one back home.  Our cat started throwing up quite a bit for several days. We think he may have been chewing on string or the underside of a couch. Any way we called around to get a vet. Our daughter's vet was already closed. One place recommended St Pete Animal hospital and Urgent Care. With Covid you drop your pet off and ""wait in your car.""  We didn't get to see the inside of the hospital, interact with the staff,  meet the doctor, etc.  The staff was great on the phone, great seeing our cat quickly and great  quickly calling us to suggest treatment. That's where the issues started to occur.  We were told he needed an x-ray, (which I knew he would need) quoted us price and said they would do the x-ray and it would take about an hour. We ran a few quick errands, came back and waited in our car for results. At the 2 hour mark we called for an update, no results.  Called again at 2 1/2 hours ""doctor is getting results now"" by now we are mad, frustrated and aggravated. Finally at 3 hours we get results, told treatment, doctor stated we ""pay more for stat xrays, but the radiologist must be busy""  So I paid extra for ""stat"" 2 hours longer than the 1 hour quoted is NOT STAT.

Feel like this place is very expensive too, yes it's urgent care but over a $600 bill and my cat only had a ""stat"" xray, fluids meds and one med to give in a.m.  Better updating when there is delays is needed!!!",2021-01-08 04:54:59,480,2108,

I had made reservations several weeks ago, requesting a table upstairs.  We arrived on time, checked in with the hostess.  We were total table would be ready shortly.  Shortly, we were told we could go upstairs.  We walk upstairs,  the table is not ready.  We have to go back down and wait.  We go back down, are waiting and I decide to take a selfie by the Christmas tree which is beautiful.  There are now 3 hostesses at the station, chatting and looking stuff up on their phones.  No interaction with us waiting or offer to take a couple's picture.  We are now told we can go up again.  Our table is a room of 3 tables of 2.  Our table is adjacent to a pocket door.  On the other side of the door is a large party with children.  Very, Very loud.  We asked to be moved, no other tables are available, BUT as soon as one becomes available we will be moved.  We find out that the other 2  tables in the room also were seated at our table and asked to be moved.  A manager appears and said a table did become available but probably would not be much better since it was right outside the room .  A little later another hostess appears and tells us they should be leaving in about 20 minutes.  They didn't leave for 45 and we never saw her again.  All 6 of us in the room had our dinner disrupted by this party.  When they called to confirm our reservations, I asked to have a candle in the dessert for my husband's birthday.  Well, we ordered the cake and no candle on the cake. We had to ask for water refills.  I thought I was at McDonald's3, not a fine restaurant.  When you are spending $45 for an entree you expect fine dining.  I believe the room is called the Senators Room, beware if you are being seated there.  They did comp all 6 of us a dessert to share.",2021-01-18 18:14:07,392,1827,

We had a delicious Sunday brunch at the Court of Two Sisters on Royal Street, as recommended by a few friends. I consider myself somewhat of an eggs benedict and gumbo connoisseur, among other things. They make a classic eggs benedict - poached eggs with Canadian bacon and hollandaise sauce on an English muffin. It was a fantastic as it looks! I've been trying a new favorite drink more frequently lately, the bloody Mary. The one I had tried a day before somewhere else in the French Quarter tasted like straight pepper. This one was just right! It had just the right amount of spice and even comes with pickled green beans on top which were so crunchy and zesty, a nice finishing touch. I'm a Southern girl and I always love having grits with a lot of cheese with breakfast. It didn't disappoint either! My travel partner ordered the boudin omelet which was exactly that - an omelet stuffed with boudin. He said it was tasty!

We didn't have reservations so the outside patio dining was full. It looked really beautiful out there, but it was still just as nice inside. There is a huge wall of glass windowpanes shining into a room lined with mirrors to enjoy the natural light. It is a really nice space and it was quiet inside, which was also nice. If you want patio seating, make reservations at least a day in advance or more, if possible.

Our server was Aaryance and she did a terrific job. She was cool and calm and answered our questions well. She helped give a few recommendations and was so attentive. We never had to wave her over and she was quick to bring us a few extra things we had asked for. Excellent service and dining experience, thanks to her!",2021-01-24 17:01:24,344,1691,

Mark came over before the flooring team just to do a thorough inspection of the issue. He was very attentive to my concerns and showed me step by step why I was experiencing the issues. David was so detailed with every step to fix the floors correctly. In fact, he inspected my trim and dry wall in the kitchen to see how insulation was done. He found some places where air was coming through, and fixed it. David came so well prepared in contrast to other workers and the quality of what he uses far exceeded what I've seen being used thus far. He was neat and cleaned up after each project, very meticulous with whatever he did. He also went around a few places in my house to inspect and ended up adjusting, advising or fixing it. He was polite, witty and overall just a very nice guy. If you have an issue with your CBH home, MAKE SURE to ask for David Enger to come and look at/ give an honest opinion or do the job. TRUST ME, I've had quite a few (4+) CBH guys come through my home and talk to me about the job(s) that need to be done, etc. David will make sure the job is done right, it's aesthetically pleasing, cleaned up after and his spirit will definitely brighten your day. 
Secondly, I'd like to acknowledge David Hoff. David assisted Mark with paint touch up and caulking. David wasn't the usual guy who does a quick and careless job. He was very precise to ensure it looked neat, clean and properly filled. Previously, I didn't even have my kitchen baseboards filled and painted after install under my counter. But, David took the time to come ask me for my sample paint so he could patch and paint correctly. In addition to this, as David was leaving he notices my front door wasn't closing correctly, and it had give after its closed. Instead of not caring, and moving on, he informed me of what he noticed wasn't right. He and Mark went on to fix my front and garage door; they're perfectly working now! Such a breathe of fresh air when people come through who #1 know what their doing, #2 are super detail oriented and #3 treat your home and space as if it were theirs.  
THESE guys made me believe in CBH's quality and character.",2021-01-14 19:08:28,490,2267,

It's a quaint little family run restaurant that has a festive seemingly authentic feel walking in and the door and the smell in the air wreaked of great Mexican comfort food. The complimentary Chips & Salsa was very good, warm crisps chips and what tasted like house made Salsa, also very good. We had seemingly inhaled them so we got another order of Chips & Queso Dip $6.5 and the Queso was OMG GOOD! We then each ordered 3 taco's, a ""Taco Pobré"", a ""Fish Taco"" and a ""Chile-Queso"" and a side of ""Re-Fried"" beans. The poor man's taco (Pobré) was simply re-fried beans, cheese & salsa and was delicious. The ""Chile-Queso"" was sautéed vegetables on a flour tortilla, it was good, not wowing and for $6 - I wouldn't order it again. The fried ""Fish Taco"" was absolutely delicious $3.5 with its tasty, crunchy fried fish pieces topped with pico & spicy-mayo. The Fish Taco's were soo good we ordered two more! Their refried beans $3 were wonderful. The restaurant was fairly crowded and appears to be a long time staple for good authentic Mexican cuisine in central Pinellas Park.
All in all it was a very good visit but we both felt that the portions were small for some of the prices. There are several items that are very, very good and we will be returning customers, but a little more discriminating on what we order.
I still highly recommend a try, I will be returning and if a few items were either increased in portion size or priced more appropriately, I would've rated it at 5 stars!",2021-01-11 17:46:34,341,1600,

I checked in at 11pm, I went to the room and it smelled like cigarettes and the bathtub had stains in it, like if it wasn't clean. So I went back to the front desk and explained the situation to the person that was working there and he went to the side and ignored me for 10 minutes. So I decided to book a room somewhere else. I don't understand why leave me waiting for 10 minutes at 11 at night with my daughter. I left and he did not refund my account. So I decided to call the next morning and I was put on hold for over 30 mins on the phone. So I hung up and called again and the person that picked up gave me an attitude when I asked him/her why was I on hold for so long. Then the replied was ""let me put this in words that you can understand"" like if I'm stupid. But he never explained himself from the beginning. I got mad then he/she called me a bitch and hung up. I was surprised in how I was treated by customer service and being the first time staying at Red Roof. This is no way to treat a paying customer. That all I wanted was a clean room for me and my daughter.  PEOPLE READING THIS. DO NOT STAY HERE. 

This happened on Saturday January 2, 2021 at 1030-11 and I called the next morning on the third around 1030-11 and got a nasty attitude by customer service all because I wanted my refund since I didn't stay the night.

I decided at the last minute to take my wild dog Cash, honestly the cutest part of this review, (Instagram #adventuresincashville) to the dog park because he needed to run off whatever was making him act like a wild man! I don't wanna say it was a donut but it could have been a donut. He's a sneaky little bugger. Lol. ANYWAY! We pull up to the dog park and he's going wild in the backseat but even he went silent as we passed the Music City Brisket Food Truck. Call it fate, kismet, some good Karma...whatever you call it, I'm here for it! 

Figuring that the bbq gods had smiled upon me knowing how little I wanted to cook tonight and following Cash's meet and greet at the park we hop skipped and jumped over to the truck. The menu featured some great items from sandwiches to tacos and ribs to loaded fries, a great menu! I chose to go with two rib entrees ($12) and an order of loaded fries ($10) topped with Yum Yum sauce (if you don't know about Yum Yum sauce GET SOME! Get in your car and go get some!!). I'll just tell you that it all looked great but the loaded fries did not make it to dinner time. lol. They were soooooooo good. Topped with cheese, brisket, jalapeño, and of course the yum yum. They do have other sauces if you don't want the most amazing sauce ever made in the history of sauces. The brisket was very good, great flavor and very tender. The ribs were really good, very tender with a little pull which for me is a perfect rib. I was pretty sleepy after so that's a sign of good bbq in my opinion. 

They also have some brisket treats for the pups but to Cash's disappointment they didn't have any. The food gods did not smile on him that day but he did get to meet some new friends at the dog park and now he's laid out on the floor exhausted from his play time! So all is well and everyone is happy!

If you've found yourself on this page, chances are you definitely disagree with me. Nonetheless, I might not be a big sandwich guy, but Middle Child makes me want to be.

Ordered pickup on their website midweek around lunchtime. Went with a Court Street's Reuben on a hoagie and a Baller Classic on a hoagie. The wait wasn't too long, and their website time estimate was on point for pickup which was really helpful for planning my arrival. One suggestion - plan ahead when you order - this is a VERY popular and busy shop that has been kicking butt during covid! Even if the wait time is longer than you expected - it is worth every second. I knew that I wanted my food in 45 mins to an hour, so I ordered accordingly. There have also been days where they temporarily turn off online ordering because they're swamped - check back on their website periodically or check their Instagram story for updates! A little planning goes a long way!!

Now for the food - the reuben was without a doubt the best reuben I've ever had - the short rib corned beef was INSANE, and the kraut, sauce, and cheese were perfect. The Baller was also great - something about the combo of mayo, pickles, and red onions made it extra special.

This has been proven to be very taxing emotionally, financially, and physically. My Godsent partnership with Sunlight Contractors, LLC is a result of my personal frustration with the unreturned phone calls, missed appointments, improper inspections, and inflated estimates I experienced with over 20 other roofing contractors.   After this hurricane, tarps were placed by someone else, but more were needed due to the continuous rains and high winds.  Mr. Ira's crew quickly provided new ones and properly nailed down the existing ones. Because I presently reside in North Texas and own property in Louisiana transacting business during this Covid-19 pandemic has been mostly virtual and proven to be adventurous.  

Authorizing Sunlight Contractors, LLC with this job assignment has me fully persuaded that there are still companies out here that want their clients to be proud of their investment (home).  I was able to select the shingles that I wanted and not pressured into selecting only what was currently in stock.  After their meticulous inspection of my property, I was provided a contract that gives the job description so in depth that it lists how many boxes of nails that are needed. My every interaction with Sunlight Contractors, LLC specifically Ms. Jessica and Mr. Ira has been enlightening, educational, impressive, reassuring and downright outstanding!!!!  Mr. Ira and Ms. Jessica have repeatedly quelled my fears with their superior, noteworthy dedication to deliver a 5 star customer satisfaction experience from the beginning to the end.  They are very patient, detail-oriented and have answered my every question with a phone call if necessary rather than a text or email.  

If you're at the beginning of the process of hiring a roofing contractor, don't do what I did and waste time and money by ""entertaining"" inexperienced contractors that aren't qualified to inspect your property let alone assist you with the insurance claim submission process.  With this company I feel like I have become a member of an ""elite group"" of people because I'm one of their clients.  Come on and join me and hire SUNLIGHT CONTRACTORS, LLC.

I was going to get a burger, but looked over YELP reviews, and decided to go with their highly-rated fried chicken, and have been craving mac n cheese, so ordered that, as well. DH ordered brick chicken and cheese curds. DH really loved the cheese curds. Felt the brick chicken was ""just okay."" My fried chicken came with hot sauce, and, much to my chagrin, it was a little too spicy for me, but DH really liked it on his chicken. As for my dinner, I thought the fried chicken was very good, but not as moist as I had read others had noted in their reviews. Crunchy, flavorful outside was satisfying.  The portion was quite large, and I only ate the breast, so the dark meat might be more juicy and flavorful tomorrow. The order includes very delicious  (apparently house made) pickles, the aforementioned hot sauce, and perhaps the most flavorful, flaky biscuits I have ever eaten (accompanied by a silky salted honey butter). The mac n cheese was odd. When I opened the container, all of the cheese sauce was on the bottom, and dry mac was on the top - that being said, it was a 10 minute walk home, in 20 degree weather, which could certainly affect this type of dish.  Mac n cheese was just not all that flavorful, despite mixing the sauce and macaroni prior to eating. It also did not have nearly enough cheese sauce. I do not know what it would be like if it was ordered to eat in-house. It is considered a ""shareable,"" and it was a portion large enough for at least 4 people to share, along with entrees.  Just not enough cheese sauce, or flavor. I will admit, I tend to prefer a rather thick cheese sauce that sticks dearly to the mac, and that was not the case here. I would say it was on the pricey side, except that it was meant to be shared among a group of diners, and the portion size supported the price. I look forward to trying it again, in-house, when the pandemic is over.  I cannot report on the ambience/service/cleanliness, etc., but the host was very pleasant when we picked up our order, and when I called earlier, due to a problem with the ordering app.",2021-01-31 05:13:33,464,2141,

Unfortunately for us, we came about 45 minutes before shift change. At 4:00 on the dot, the night server came in and we immediately heard our current server from the way back end of the restaurant yell ""you gotta take over my tables!!"" And he straight up yelled ""nope"" right back. It was so loud and I mean... we were sitting. right. there. 

We then heard them all bicker and joke around about who he did or didn't bring lunch for all while being completely ignored from 4 - 4:15 while they all chit chatted in their little back room where they finally had the common sense to shut the door. 

Our original server finally came back around to us and our empty waters and dry $65 dollar platter waiting on extra sauce to inform us she was ""going on break"" and the night server would be over. Guess who we never saw? Correct! The night server! 

The only person who maybe seemed like she was in change (or maybe she was the bartender?) came and refilled our waters (yup, they were still empty) and maybe 20 minutes after that a random girl working the cash register up front came to cash us out. 

Weird that the morning girl would so easily give up a $150 check instead of hanging around 20 more minutes. We also heard her complain about morning tips to the maybe manager/bartender. Makes sense now. Also weird the night server wouldn't scoop up an easy almost finished table with such a high check average. 

If business keeps running like how we witnessed it, this place won't last a year more. Good thing they have a disclaimer on the menu that says ""no refunds"". It's gotta be the only thing keeping this place afloat. What a joke.

They completed the service at the end of October issuing a report that the 30 year-old furnace was fully serviced and in working order. Upon running the furnace for the first time after their service we were not getting heat to the 2nd floor radiators. Having worked closely with a plumber in the past I knew I likely just had to bleed the radiators. I checked the T&P boiler gauge first to see if adequate pressure was being applied. The gauge was reading close to 0 which led me to believe I need to add water to the system. Upon doing so a little bit at a time the expansion tank sprung a leak almost within minutes.

At this time, I delineated that the culprit must have been a faulty T&P boiler gauge because there was no change on the gauge throughout this process of adding water and springing the leak. I called WM Henderson to come out as they were the ones to sign off on a fully functioning furnace. I told the dispatcher I had water spraying out of my expansion tank which was all a domino effect from having a faulty T&P gauge despite the system just having been inspected. The dispatcher agreed that invoice for the initial service made no mention of a T&P reading even been taken at the time of the service so he had no problem waving what would have been a $95 service call. 

The technician, Brandon, showed up (in a timely manner) but was extremely rude and dismissive. I had turned the emergency switch off to the furnace (due to the leak) which he immediately switched back on and said ""it's wasn't working because the switch was off"". Clearly the issue I was having hadn't been communicated properly between the dispatcher and the technician otherwise he would have known not to restart the system. Once he recognized what had happened he told me that he didn't have an expansion tank or a T&P gauge with him so he couldn't fix it but he would write up a work order. I mentioned to him that I would be seeking WM Henderson to cover the cost of the repairs as it was them that failed to notate a faulty T&P gauge. His response was ""we never notated those faulty gauges because they are always faulty on furnaces this old.""

I followed up with the office on Monday morning. I gave the administrative assistant a recount of these events and she said that the call was recorded and that her service manager would review it in a few hours. 

Eric, the service manager, responded in a timely manner and heard the same recount of events. He acknowledged and took ownership that the technician, Joe, who performed the initial service had likely made an oversight in reporting the faulty T&P gauge. I also told him what Brandon had told me about technicians not notating these kind of issues and Eric responded by saying that he would speak to Brandon about that because that is not acceptable by company standards.

At this point I believe that Eric and I are on the same page about WM Henderson covering the repairs due to this series of missteps by their employees...but I was very wrong.

He said despite all of that WM Henderson was not taking responsibility for repairing the furnace at no cost. He said he was happy to refund the seller what they paid for the service because it was not completed to satisfaction but that was as far as he would go. $59 refund to a person that no longer owns the property and is not at all effected. Instead he was insistent that I should pay $494 for the expansion tank replacement, $371 for the T&P boiler gauge replacement, and & $530 to drain and refill the system. None of these invoices listed out the cost for the parts & labor. Just one line item for the job.

Supply houses sell the expansion tank I need for $30 - $45. This means the labor they would like to charge is over $400. And if you do a simple internet search on replacing an expansion tank or just look at the tank itself you will see that this price for labor is astronomically expensive. Would likely take a 'skilled HVAC technician' as Eric described them, a half hour at the most. 

Supply houses sell a T&P boiler gauge for $10 - $21. This means the labor they charge is over $300. 

The system is already drained due to the 10 gallons of water I removed in buckets because of the leak, but they want to charge $530 to drain and refill the system.

I ended up telling Eric that I felt that the owner of the company would be very disappointed if he knew how his service department was representing him and that I'd really like to hear from him on the matter. Eric told me that he'd leave the paperwork on his desk but it was unlikely that the owner would return my call. 

Overall, and to say the least, WM Henderson should be ashamed. Through their actions (or lack thereof) they have accepted that if their technicians do not fulfill their duties it will be, not only tolerated, but defended and accepted. Please seek other options at all costs.",2021-01-05 03:31:44,1026,4984,

Mom and dad loved the ""light, thin crust pizza #calorieconscious"" so we would get C&M's pizza. As we bit in to the crunchy crust I always remember half of the slice ending up on my lap due to the extra cracker-y style dough. I never ate the crust and always wanted more. 

...Fast Forward 25 Years- to Dec 28th 2020, COVID Times... Moved back to Seminole and had to have Charlie and Millie's pizza for the pure nostalgia of it. Ordered two large pizzas: mushroom & green pepper and half pepperoni & mushroom. Now- I get it- we're in tough times but man it was some skimpy pizza. The crust was still as remember it, crumbling all over my lap again, the squares were still square, however the toppings were lackluster! 

A solid one inch from where the end of the ""barely there"" sauce and ""kinda"" cheese was a very browned, extra crispy, cracker of a tasteless crust - one that I didn't even bother with. Shameful to leave crust but this time it was a MUST.

I'll revisit the ""barely there"" sauce but it wasn't really much of anything besides a tint of red atop my cracker. And the kinda cheese made me feel like I microwaved a cracker with some tricolored cheese on it. It was ""kinda"" there, ""kinda not"".

Mushrooms were straight out of a can which is the usual, green peppers were just ok. And the Hubs said the pepperonis were anything but that- there was more ""roni"" than pepper or flavor. 

I'm not writing them off yet as they were still as friendly and welcoming as they were 25 years ago, but I'm for sure not going back any time soon. So 2.5 stars for nostalgia and friendliness and I'm keeping 2.5 stars for the red cracker I ate.",2021-01-12 18:49:08,381,1749,

I called and scheduled an appointment. My first clue that this wasn't a legitimate cleaning company was when the technician brought in the machine to clean and a huge wad of blond hair ( that wasn't mine)  blew onto my sofa. He also dropped the heavy metal head of the vacuum on my floor and took a small sliver of my wood out of my floor. I thought it's ok I'll just cover it with a wood color marker. The technician cleaned my sofa and then set the sofa cushions on my red cherry floor to dry. Long story short my red cherry wood floor bled onto the cushions. He also told me to put them back on the sofa in a few hours. I called the next day to tell them that the cushions had stains on them. They eventually sent another team out to clean them. They tried everything but the stains remained. They figured out how my cushion were stained. They asked if I'd allow them to take the cushions to their facility to try and clean them. I agreed but said I needed them back in three days. Noah was supposed to come get them on December , 2020 but they sent a random employee to pick them up. He didn't have any bags or protective covering to protect my cushions from further stain damage. I had to call countless times to find out the status. They finally brought them back on December 10, 2020. I received a call on December 9, 2020 and said the cushions looked great. When they were delivered back to my home they were returned in the same black garbage bags I sent them in. There was absolutely no change in the stains on the cushions. I doubt they even tried to clean them. I called again to tell them there was no change in the stains. I received the run around. A person named Mary was who I talked to. She was going to call me right back once she talked to the OKC. I didn't hear anything from Mary. I called several times and kept getting passed around. I asked to speak with the corporate customer service. I talked to Darrell on December 11, who seemed to care. He said he'd get back to me by December 15th. Finally on December 17, I received a voicemail from Jasmine. I was at a funeral for a dear friend that passed away from Covid. I returned the call on December 18, and I left a message. I left another message for Jasmine on December 21. I never received a call back from Jasmine. Stanley Steamer Mary called December 28, I missed the call but called her back within 28 minutes and left a voice Mail.  Mary didn't call me back, I tried again on the December  29, 2020 and went to voicemail I left another message. I didn't receive a return call from Mary. I called Stanley Steamers regular number and talked to Libby and I asked to talk to another corporate customer service rep. She wanted to send me to OKC to speak with Noah and I said no I haven't received any results from him. Then she wanted to send me back to Mary that had never returned a call to me and I said absolutely not. Libby put me on hold to talk with her manager. I was on hold for 5 minutes. When she came back on the line she said her manager was trying to reach someone. They sent me to Jasmine again. Jasmine wanted me to send pictures. I couldn't believe they didn't have  pictures after all the time they'd had my cushions. Jasmine said she'd look into it and call me back. I reminded her that she'd told me that before but didn't. She did call me back that day an told me that they were turning the claim over to insurance. I was finally contacted on January 7; 2021 by insurance. He told me he needed pictures and a statement. I sent him pictures, a statement and all the documentation I had of the run around that started on November 19, 2020. I had to go through all of this while grieving for a dear friend that has been family.  Stanley Steamer has caused me additional stress because of all the run around and dealing with this issue for almost two months. Mr. Dippel the insurance rep for Stanley Steamer is offering me $250 for my sofa and a signed release for damages. He also suggested if I wasn't satisfied I could turn it into my homeowners insurance. What an insult. I'm not stupid and I do not want to have my insurance rates go up because of Stanley Steamers mistake. I cannot find the receipt for my sofa so $250 is the best they can do. My sofa was in excellent condition besides a few spots that they got out. I would still have a pristine sofa for several year if it wasn't for them ruining it. The company I purchased from has went out of business. I plan to contact their CEO and take them to small claims court. I'm out at least $1,500 because of their mistake. DO NOT USE THIS DISHONEST COMPANY THAT SENDS UNTRAINED TECHNICIANS OUT TO YOUR HOME.

There is always a stunning display ... actually quite fantastic!  They are decorated for Valentines so get that reservation in.  

Inside they have oriental room screens set up With subtle accent lighting behind them.   They are set at a distance on the perimeter of the ballroom providing a serene and elegant environment.

Now !!....our server, Steven.... !!!!
Steven has mastered fine service.   He is always aware of his tables, friendly and warm, providing immediate service for any of your needs while remaining largely invisible.  He is an expert at paying close attention to every little detail, never hovering and particularly good at pacing service based on your wishes.  I've been fortunate to have eaten at many fine dining establishments and Steven is one of the best at caring for his customers.

Take a good look at the menu.... wow!  I would like to point out that every item has a special and irresistible flavor..., the portions are generous ( this is definitely a pleasure to enjoy a little take home remembrance ....)
The food is seriously fresh and the "" on the half shell"" items are a few steps from the ocean.., plump and sweet.  The accompanying condiments are traditional yet unique in subtle ways.

Let me say, ""My Favorite Appetizer"" as it is titled on the menu is an EPIC and deliciously irresistible version of seared tuna with really generous and wonderful side compliments ... from now on I'm doing a double order because it's hard to let go of the last bite and everyone at the table felt the same as they dug into MY Favorite Appetizer.

We tend to order a lot of items because it's almost impossible to resist their menu.  The French Onion Soup is the best any of us have ever had.

The $$$ is well worth it and during Covid, we have not found restaurants up to their usual standards  I understand they have to cut corners to survive and so we especially appreciate the continued amazing menu quality and variety,!the decor and most of all, tip top service at a time when food servers are truly struggling to survive.

Oh, wow, don't miss the dessert tray!  It's been a very long time since I've seen such a variety and generosity in portions.  And there are no boring yummy sweets here!

RESERVATIONS ?!?   YES !

Our recent visit was a Wednesday night and they were very very busy.  I had thought during this Covid time that reservations on a Wednesday evening would not be necessary, but thank goodness we had the forethought to make them!! 
 
Note:  they still have outside seating right now and curb pick up to accommodate those who have concerns   They are also blessed with very spacious dining areas so   
that tables are more than placed at required social distancing which also provides privacy, a pleasant quiet space, and a nice serenity that makes you feel as if you have a private dining experience.",2021-01-28 17:47:31,589,2990,

Open since June 2020, I really want to give this location just 3 stars for having 6 self-checkout registers operational (& encouraged) daily, but just 1-2 manned checkouts open. (A staffer explained the checkout situation.) With all the self-checkouts, that's at least four people who weren't hired here. 

Personal peeves aside, it is a very nice grocery featuring many GMO-free, Gluten-free, organic, vegetarian, vegan, etc items. There are also 3 bars-- burrito, pizza/sandwiches, & Asian. Beer is sold here, along w/ a nice selection of fresh flowers. There's a soup bar & a salad bar. There's a long aisle of bulk grains, nuts, flours, coffees, candy, etc. And cheeses-- lots & lots of cheeses w/ a staffer overseeing the area. More expensive bottles of chilled wines are available (see pic), there's a Grab-N-Go section if you're in need of a quick meal, & very nice covered outside eating areas complete w/ ceiling fans-- located on the Eastside & the Northside. There are even glossy black grocery carts:)

Prices are higher here due to all the specialty items/brands, which leaves less room on the shelves for lower-priced ones. (For instance, there was no Hillshire Farms sausage, so I had to buy a more expensive speciality brand for a simple cabbage recipe I planned to make.)

Definitely a nice store. Not as upscale as Whole Foods (or w/ as many foreign cheeses), but worth a visit. No plastic bags are provided; you'll receive a paper one w/ handles. Curbside service is available & there's a Rewards Program-- see pic. 

There appeared to be many members of management on the floor. I was surprised that they were not more friendly to customers. The front end staff; however, was very friendly.

I don't reside in the area, but I'll probably stop in again. It's a fun store to browse. If you're having company or a dinner party (or want to run in to grab a quick lunch), this location is a good option.",2021-01-10 06:00:50,443,2066,

It didn't appear too have too much heating outside so we chose to dine inside. The design was a pretty clean, modern wood furnish. Each table had sanitizer ready, and everyone wore masks. The server was attentive and nice. Going into the menu we ordered the Dan Dan noodle, dumplings in chili oil sauce, scallion pancakes, and pork belly bun. The Dan Dan noodles were slightly spicy, slightly sweet, with bits of ground pork in a thick sauce. It was pretty delightful to eat, and different as I'm used to a thinner variation of noodle for Dan Dan noodles. The slight extra chewiness of the noodles was a refreshing change. The dumplings had just enough dough, with the right tenderness. I was slightly sad at the filling amount, but the chili oil sauce was a perfect mixture of sweet and spicy. The pork belly bun was great in flavor and filling with melt in the mouth braised soy marinated goodness mixed with not too sweet peanut power, pickled mustard greens, and cilantro. Unfortunately the dish failed in its packaging; the bun was inconsistent with many parts being hard and dried out. Last was scallion pancakes. The pancakes were perfectly fried and cut into pie slices stacked atop each other. There was enough scallions to accentuate the dish, yet not overpower the overall taste. The sauce enhanced the pancakes with its subtle sweetness to contrast the slight salty note. I tried dressing the pancake with the chili oil sauce and that worked wonders as well. Overall I would come again to expand my taste buds.

P.S. the dishes tasted are more of a family feel taste. I think if one were to try other entrees it might be better to try other entree dishes for a more unique dining experience.",2021-01-18 18:09:23,348,1775,

And the rooms are very nice for what you pay. But my issues were that they seemed very disorganized. There were quite a few hidden fees like If you want your guest to take pictures it's a $35 fee, if they take you pictures there's a fee (which we knew) but when they send you prints they are AWFUL BLURRY quality and then if you want to buy any from your gallery is $30 PER PICTURE for the digital download. So we essentially got ZERO picture because the prints they sent are unusable and I'm not paying $900 for my total gallery and I didn't pay the $35 like I should have because I trusted them to handle my pictures but was unaware of how low quality they would be and how expensive downloading them would be. I also have to add that they claim they have ""professional photography"". But Their photos do not come anywhere near the level of professional photography. And with how much they are charging if pay for WELLLLLLL OVER the cost they paid for the 10 year cameras they were using. So they either need to reinvest like any real professional would or drop down their photography price.
Secondly the front disk lady (older with a mullet haircut) was very rude to me. My mom and my maid of honor brought it up as soon as we left. Like they couldn't believe she really spoke to me the way she had. She was very snappy and very impatient 
It feels as though they just didn't care about your wedding, which is SUPPOSED TO BE the biggest day of your life so that was very disheartening. Would never recommend. I am quite surprised about their rating on here based off of our experience.

Chad singled out a small portion of siding that needed replaced. He was scattered every time I spoke with him on the phone. The job was scheduled three different times before the workers finally came which messed up our exterior painter's schedule. The job Beautiful Homes did for us wasn't great. After Chad agreed to fix issues after the job was completed only 1/2 were fixed. We were done messing around with the company. Our painter found MULTIPLE areas of siding that needed replaced that Chad should have easily seen since this is his specialty. Chad didn't do what we asked him to do and in the end wanted to put the blame on us. Don't bother contacting this company. You'll end up fixing it on your own or paying another company to come finish the job.

In response to your reply: I was your customer. This is the truth. You said you missed some areas on our final walk through when I pointed them out but at that point we were done working with you, we were not impressed with the workmanship that already needed to be fixed.  Later as the painter went around to paint our exterior he found water damage siding that you missed. The point of having you come was to find and fix all the water damaged siding which is your specialty. We wanted the repairs done before before we painted and added gutters.  I never said the painter repaired your mistakes.  If a painter can see wood rot/ soft boards and that isn't his specialty then that makes you look even worse. You told me that the painter could fix your terrible caulking job. Like I said, DON'T BOTHER.  A company willing to let another company fix the left over mess is the WRONG COMPANY.

Response: It is very unprofessional to post our address. You have the address incorrect which proves my scatter point perfectly.  You are still missing the point. I asked you to inspect and fix the water damaged siding. I hired you to look over all the home. You let someone else tell you where the issues were rather than being a professional and doing your own examination. An inspector points to issues and recommends hiring a professional to come look at the home in more detail. That is why we hired you and why we are disappointed.

During the walk through of the initial work I pointed out several poor craftsmanship issues. The caulking was terrible aside from the craftsmanship issues. You promised to fix more than you actually did. You never checked back in after ""correcting"" the mistakes. Not all of them were corrected that you agreed to. That tells me we weren't worth your time. This post is to show you aren't a 5 star business. I hired you because we wanted a 5 star professional to do the work. Your foreman agreed the work that was done was lacking. That is why we received a discount. You're the boss so this is on you. You didn't like me saying it in person and you could have fixed it with me in person and you didn't. You took back your word which is bad business. My review is accurate. 

I am not going back and forth with you anymore.",2021-01-12 17:19:27,635,3124,

I happened to be in South Reno so picked it up on my way home. My husband called it in about 10 minutes before I arrived, and it took about another 10 minutes before it was ready. All the staff I interacted with was friendly. The restaurant was very clean and had an open feel. The drive home was miserable - it smelled so good but the bag was tied (thankfully, or else I would have eaten all the fries before I made it home). 
I arrived home to three hungry kids and my husband (also hungry). Our full order was two large fries, pulled pork, two orders of mac & cheese, and a brisket burrito. 
The fries had great seasoning and everyone in our family really enjoyed them, particularly the baby (11 months old). They would definitely have tasted better prior to the 25 minute ride home - not much I can do about that.  We only managed to make it through one if the orders of fries, the other went into the fridge and will be great reheated for dinner tomorrow. 
The big kids and I demolished one of the macaroni & cheese cartons (16oz). My middle child typically turns up his nose at anything except Kraft but he actually liked this stuff. It isn't my favorite mac and cheese but it was tasty. We tossed the second carton into the fridge for lunches and dinners over the next couple days.
I don't generally eat a ton of meat so it is hard to comment on the pulled pork. I had a bite and it was smoky but generally had good flavor. The kids weren't interested in it at all. We put the lid back on and tossed it into the fridge for my husband to eat later. 
My husband had the brisket burrito. It was a pretty massive burrito. I didn't taste it. He said it was good but different. Whatever that means. Expect his review in the near-ish future. 
I will definitely eat here again. I'll just get into the fries before I make it home so they'll be fresher :).",2021-01-14 05:58:53,420,1934,

My husband, a big fan of Indian cuisine, frequently eats here. It was our anniversary last night so we decided to celebrate ""COVID style"" by ordering food for take out. I called about 6:30pm to place my order so I could pick it up on my way home from work. The man who answered the phone was very nice and said the order would be ready in 15 minutes. I arrived to pick up my order and it was ready on time. The gentleman who helped me I believe is the owner. He is always so welcoming and treats you as if he has known you his whole life. He gave me a discount and thanked me for my support. He even offered to bring my two bags of food out to the car for me which I declined, but it was nice of him to offer.
We ordered Lamb Biryani, Chicken Tikka Masala (my favorite Indian dish), Garlic Naan, and Masala Chicken Wings. I must admit it is strange to order chicken wings from an Indian restaurant, but these wings are awesome! They have a special sauce added to them that make them taste like Indian cuisine. You can order them mild, medium, or spicy (as well as many other dishes on the menu). The owner told us he had eaten wings at other places in town then made his own version. Hands down my favorite wings!
The Chicken Tikka Masala was tasty and the chicken was tender. It was very good over rice. We also enjoyed the Garlic Naan. My husband ate all of his Lamb Biryani...and was stuffed, but happy! 
The restaurant is clean, but was sadly empty last night except for one family that was eating in a booth. Hopefully it was just past the dinner rush. 
Please consider giving this restaurant a try when you are craving Indian cuisine...or want to try it for the first time. They also offer other American dishes in case Indian cuisine is not your thing.",2021-01-08 06:55:39,395,1834,

This fall we stayed at the Sand Pearl and made reservations for outdoor seating, for the fantastic view and Covid-19 precautions. The whole experience was wonderful. The steak was one of the best we have had.

To celebrate a special occasion in December, we invited friends to join us for steak dinner, the view, and some safety outside. This time we were not hotel guests so made reservations via Yelp. After booking for 6pm online, I called to request outdoor seating (didn't see option online for special requests). They made a note of this, saying in case of inclement weather, there would be a table inside. 

We all arrived early and had drinks outside nearby while waiting for our reservation time. At 6, I approached the host stand, and was told there were no tables available outdoors and no guarantee of outdoor seating in spite of the reservation with the request. We had seen several parties seated outdoors while we waited. Had we know if was first come, first served, we would have/could have. At first, I was very disappointed, but quickly focused on Plan B. 

We ended up sitting outside at Tate's (at a nice distance from other tables) and probably had more fun there anyway. Great service from Dylan. But no Caretta's steak--the reason we drove to Clearwater Beach.

I am posting this experience not so much to complain (ok, a little bit), but to share my lessons learned. 

- A reservation is not necessarily a sure thing. 
- Call multiple times to confirm and clarify.
- Confirm in person upon early arrival.
- Embrace Plan B. And be kind in these crazy times.",2021-01-03 13:24:28,346,1689,

None of our dogs require cuts and grooming in the formal sense. It's usually just baths, mail trims, gland squeezing and such. Our little senior dog's breath is an issue so we often get his teeth cleaned for a small additional fee.

We have always had them finish in a timely manner. When we can't get the dogs right when they are finished they usually sit cozy together in their kennel. As I read some of these other reviews - I like to consider why take your dog somewhere and try to force a facility to meet your needs (i.e. time restraint) than taking on a day when you have more time? I have also know MANY other locations to accidentally send a dog home with the wrong person. I'm not saying it isn't upsetting but it's human error. God forbid we get cancelled for our humanity.

It hurts to see people going around finding reviews that are low ratings helpful because they are still in their feelings about an experience that wasn't made clear. Personally, I take my dogs and refer folks often. The prices are the fairest and before COVID sometimes my dog would get to just hang back as she waited for me to pick her up. 

Have they accidentally cut too far into the nails before? Yes. Once. It wasn't fun to deal w in my car but we survived. The joy these folks have in the work they do, the affordable prices and the willingness to work with me on short notice are all reasons I keep coming back. I'm not expecting their services to be perfect every single time.

Have been concerned about how full a place is, and being inside, especially in Florida. Our friends arrived first, and got seats on the outside, which really isn't so much outside since there are canvas like flaps all over. Luckily we were sitting by the door to the actual outside, which meant getting fresh air. Didn't really care for the amount of people walking by getting to their tables. For me, the tables were too close together, meaning if someone walked by, they were right beside you. Our friends love dining here, for my husband and I, it's ok. I'm not as excited by it, and I'm not sure why. Our waitress was good, but didn't really explain that 2 for 1 happy hour meant doing double tall drinks. Would have been nice to know when I thought saying I was ready for my second beverage meant it was the other part of the 2 for 1. My husband and I split a grouper sandwich, which was good, not great. We chose the beans and rice as our side, which I really did like. Good mixture of each, and love the black beans. Of course I had to have some soup, so I went with the seafood gumbo. This I highly recommend! Nice mixture of shrimp and scallops in a very tasty tomato base. Maybe in the summer I would be more excited about the restaurant, since it sits in the marina.

We had to book a 7:30 reservation because we wanted the greenhouses. I didn't realize how popular this place was but I totally understand it now! When we got to our greenhouse I was in awe!! It was completely shut off from everyone else, SO warm, and absolutely adorable. It was a freezing cold night and I was so thankful it was actually heated. The decor was so adorable and I couldn't stop taking pictures! Just a warning, the greenhouses are clear so you can see/hear the people around you. We had a loud group next to us but honestly didn't bother us at all!

We got our drink and food menu and it took us awhile to decide. Between the four of us we got two Harper's Punches, a glass of Pinot Noir, and a glass of Brut Rose. I'm unsure of how Harper's Punch works because it seemed on the menu like it switches? Either way, our waitress told us that it was an assortment of fruits and Bacardi, which sounded amazing, and let me tell you it was!! Make sure you ask for a straw to mix it up. It was delicious and quite strong! My friends enjoy their glasses of wine as well.

We ordered our food and I would say the only downside to this place is the wait. We wanted a bit for our drinks, but the food was very long. I understand that they are busy, so trust me I'm not angry, I was just super hungry! I finished my drink before my food even came so that was a bummer (didn't order another because I was driving!) Our waitress came and told us she was sorry for the wait and that it would be out in a minute, and it was still about a 5-10 minute wait from there. I understand it was a busy time so I didn't let this affect my opinion! 

My food was amazing!! I got the Black Caraway Triangoli Pasta. I was nervous to try it because it had apple and mushrooms, but honestly it was a delicious combo! My friend and I split the fries and the aioli it comes with was amazing! I could not stop eating them! My one girlfriend got the butternut squash soup. It is listed as an appetizer but she wanted to try it. She said it definitely needed some salt but wasn't terrible. If she were to come back though, she wouldn't get it. My two other friends got the burger and the oysters. Both were amazing! We were very much satisfied.

Overall, one of the most beautiful and safe places I've found in the city to dine at. Great food and great service! I will be returning shortly to try out their brunch because that seems to be the rave here!!",2021-01-31 16:30:46,574,2588,

It's what makes the pie - and really, any pizza. The toppings are also carefully chosen for not only their quality but how well they blend into a delicious bite. 

I had their pizza once when they were still at the original location (and sent my husband to wait outside for a few hours until they opened!) and it was fabulous. I ordered it again last nice from their new restaurant location, which was so much easier - I was able to schedule a pickup and pay online. I live in Montco, so we didn't even eat it fresh - we took it home for football (Go Bills) and reheated it per their instructions. It was still SO much better than any fresh pizza I'd get around here. 

We got the No. 1, which is your classic cheese pizza - tomato, whole milk mozz, royer mountain cheese. We added pepperoni, which was just spicy enough. This is not the kind of pie you want to pile with toppings, so I'd suggest a max of one per pizza. We also got the No. 2, greens, calabrian cream, mozzarellas, royer mountain cheese. I also added pickled chilis (serranos) to go with the light spice of the calabrian cream. Note that this one doesn't have tomato sauce, it's more of a white pie, but I wanted the contrast with the No. 1. The greens were nice and crispy from the oven and the chilis delivered the spice I wanted! I might try this with roasted onions next time. 

The arrabbiata appears to have a spicy tomato base and pickled serranos, which is also up my alley, so I might have to try that too. I'm even considering trying the anchovy pie just because I trust them to make something really delicious.

The dining room had plenty of seating and the tables were spaced far enough away from each other. We got there a few hours before the live music started but note to self, check it out for a fun weekend kickoff! 

Hubby and I both ordered the shepherds pie, our youngest got boring chicken tenders and the oldest got the fish and chips. Our server kept up from being thirsty as she stayed on top of the refills! The bartender even came around a few times to check on us. 

The shepherds pie was as spectacular as I remembered, with a rich depth of beefy flavor and an ample topping of cheesy mashed potatoes! And garlic toast points to sop up some of the Guinness beef gravy left in the pie dish!  This entree is notoriously known as classic comfort food and it definitely felt like a warm hug! My youngest wasn't as enthusiastic about his chicken tenders but really, they're tenders, nothing extraordinary about them for the most part. My oldest, on the other hand, absolutely loved his fish and chips! He got the pub style. They were huge, fresh, perfectly fried and seasoned! He doesn't use dipping sauces and apparently this dish didn't need any to help the flavor. Side note, it is served with tarter sauce and coleslaw that he 86ed. 

We met one of the owners, Ash, and he was super friendly and charming! We discussed the shepherds pie for a few minutes and a few other odds and ends. He went into the kitchen and retuned a few minutes later with fried cheesecake for my family! Such a hospitable gesture! Needless to say, it was crispy and ooey gooey delicious.... the perfect ending to our very robust flavorful meals!

They have a new cauliflower rice option that we wanted to try. I will preface this review with the fact that we both love Chipotle. It's a always a good, quick meal that hits the spot.

This particular evening Chipotle was booming. A line around the dining area and things were moving rather slow. I'd say 15 minute wait to get to our order. When we got to the front, we both ordered bowls with cauliflower rice. Unfortunately, there was none ready at the moment. After waiting in that line, we had to stand aside and wait for the cauliflower rice to finish cooking. Another 5 minute wait. Then, when you order it, the employee warns you that the cauliflower rice is an extra $2 charge and you only get a small spoonful. It barely covers the bottom of the bowl.

After that, you go down the line and order as usual. The two cauliflower rice bowls, drinks and chips with queso was $33. Having made it through the hectic line, we finally sat down in the back to enjoy our meals.

Digging in, the bowl was what you expect Chipotle to be. A massive, heavy,  mexican style meal. While the cauliflower rice was a healthier choice, it is not a choice we will make again. You get a small amount for the $2 and it's very watery at the bottom. With all the different flavors packed onto a Chipotle bowl, the cauliflower rice didn't shine through and frankly, I never even noticed it all that much. In the end, while it may have saved us some carbs, we didn't think it was worth it.

We will continue to eat at Chipotle when the craving hits and this location is convenient for us. The staff wasn't super friendly this evening but maybe it was because they were pretty busy. I suppose you can try the cauliflower rice for dietary reasons but we won't be spending the $2 again.",2021-01-14 15:40:32,393,1833,

With our previous experiences with New Holland Auto as well as Jeff D'Ambrosio, we were not thrilled to set foot into another dealership. However, all those fears and discomfort were put aside when we met our car dealer, Steve Gray. Oh my goodness he was just an absolute joy to work with not just because he was a pleasant person but because he knew so much about Jeep, was passionate about the brand, passionate about us as customers, and the least pushy salesman I had ever met. And just as a little insight my fiancee and I are very passive and avoid conflict in every way so it was fantastic meeting someone who did not put on immense pressure for a more expensive vehicle or try to upsell copious packages we did not need or want. Fast forward to us finding a vehicle and we are off to the finance department, again a huge feeling of dread because we don't know this person and again in care dealerships, they put immense pressure on you to buy all the bells and whistles.  Then once more we were met with an incredible finance person who did not shove anything down our throats. He went through everything and gave us information but at no point did we feel as though he was forcing us to purchase anything or using us to meet some sort of quota. Overall I could not recommend this dealership enough because every here seems pretty great. Can't wait until next year when I get to trade my lease in, I will definitely be going back to Videon.",2021-01-10 21:33:29,313,1560,

To start off we were sat right away at a table that looks over the water. We started with some drinks they were perfect, not too strong not too weak just right. We then got some apps we got the warm crab dip AMAZING seriously one of the best I've ever had, and a small Caesar which was the perfect size to split as a side salad for the two of us!! For own main dish i got the salmon which was cooked to perfection (I'm very picky about salmon too) and it came with garlic green beans that were excellent, my boyfriend got the bleu cheese crusted filet and they too cooked that to his liking and he said it was fabulous!! The co-owner of the restaurant named Bruce walked around and greeted everyone and asked how our dinners were and i thought that was just great, especially during these hard times it's nice to see how thankful our business is to smaller businesses #supportlocal! He then sat a table next to ours with a couple who eat there regularly (the Flanegans) Somehow we all got in conversation and just sat and talked over drinks and it just honestly made our experience that much better! Bruce hearing that my boyfriend is a philadelphia police officer gave us a $25 gift card to come back which honestly meant so much to us! So if your looking for a spot with great drinks, AMAZING food, a very attentive staff, and great company do not look any further this is the spot to go! Hopefully you get sat next to the lovely Flanegans cause they were great!! Bruce thank you so much we will be returning regularly and bringing a crowd with us!",2021-01-16 16:07:40,345,1668,

Hostess greeted us, took my name and phone number (covid contact tracing?) and sat us across from where the servers come out from the kitchen.

After a few minutes, or server came by and explained that the we code on the table was how we would get menus. (Hostess could have mentioned it, but whatever) She got our drink order quickly and came back to take our order. 

We asked about the ranch flights and she gave us a small paper with names on it to pick the ones we wanted. We had to ask for a pencil. Some have goofy names, but no descriptions. So we skipped those. Picked a couple that she said were the most popular and places out lunch order.

Teen got the bid kid Mac and cheese and I got the Jack the Ripper burger. Both, our server claimed, were favorites and wonderful.

We got the ranch flight and started tasting them. Seasoned fires made no sense to either of us, as the taste of the fry seasoning mixed with the taste of the ranch. Unseasoned fries would have made more sense.

Sadly, the ranch wasn't good. The seasonings all had very artificial taste and even the OG ranch wasn't great. When asked if we wanted to take the rest home, we passed.

Of the 13 dressings we tried, only 2 tasted like what they said. Avocado and pesto. Others were blah.

The food came out after and was ok. Burger was cooked correctly, but I think they forgot to add the ranch, as I found none of it. 

The Mac and cheese was the big loser of the day. Teenager barely ate any and said it tasted weird. I tried it and it had a chemical/liquid smoke weird flavor. Didn't even look like the other pictures online.

While having lunch, we also watched as the servers and cooks gathered in the back area, loudly talking to each other without their masks on. They did pull them up when they came out around customers.

I looked at buying a t shirt as a way to try and save the day, but my teen pointed out that the logo made no sense (""it looks like internet explorer"") and the text of the name was odd.

The meal and experience were disappointing. Like, ""I'm sorry we came here, I read good reviews online"" disappointment.",2021-01-16 14:21:40,473,2187,

I'm notorious for waiting til the last minute to use my vision benefits. This year was no different. Thanks to these nice folks, I got it done!

Luckily, I was able to score a next-day appointment at this location. I arrived a couple of kind before my appointment but had to stand waiting at the front door for almost ten minutes due to COVID-19 protocol - there wasn't anyone available to take my temp and do my questionnaire.

I had another obligation that evening, so I needed to make this appointment as quick as possible. I asked them to pull over my insurance info from the other location to save time...of course, they didn't. So, I had to wait for them to verify my insurance and obtain benefits. Those steps should be done prior to the patient presenting, especially if I tell you that my vision benefits are not available online - you must call. That was irritating, an opportunity to revamp protocol and reduce wait time, and possibly increase customer satisfaction. 

I had a long wait before my appointment, so I used the time to pick out my frames. I loved that they are watching and every frame you touch gets sanitized before being replaced. And there's a frame for everyone: nuthin too fancy though. Don't expect to find high-end designer, haute couture styles here. Just metal, tortoise shell, and colored plastic.

The chain runs behind at every location I've ever used. It was almost 45 minutes after my appointment that I finally saw the doctor. 

They took retinal photos - those pricey ones - even though I shared I wasn't interested and had already taken them the year prior. But then STILL dilated my eyes... if you've already taken the photos, why not just evaluate the eye health and keep it moving? That's petty.

The doc, Dr. Colon, I think... was super friendly. Loved chatting with her during my appointment. She's one of those folks that I could see myself meeting for happy hour after work. IRL we could certainly be friends. 

At checkout, they tried to charge me for some ""extra"" services... to the tune of $60! No ma'am. Not today. The GM told the young lady that she spoke with me earlier and explained all the fees... umm, nope. I had never seen the GM a say in my life! I asked to speak with her and told her that exactly. She then apologized and said I ""looked"" like the woman she spoke with earlier. They adjusted the charges without further incident, so I was pleased. 

About 1.5 total spent there just getting my exam. I didn't even buy glasses.",2021-01-06 14:15:48,522,2499,

This place is huge when compared to most liquor stores.  But unlike buying liquor at a grocery, here the staff is knowledgeable and helpful.  The selection as you might guess is huge and the prices very reasonable!  
  
I won't promise they will have everything you need, but this is sure a good place to start.  They even have rewards programs and classes for those who want to learn more about the products offered here.  I live an hour away, otherwise, I would be intrigued by the options!

The store wasn't swamped when we entered, but it was quite busy and they had enough check out stations open to make that process quick too!

Because it is in a shopping center, we found a spot close to the entrance.  And the parking is free too!

Our friends took a little longer since they were going through the aisles of wine.  I was simply looking at liqueurs and though I didn't find the particular flavor of brandy that I was looking for, I grabbed a bottle of sloe gin that was put to use later in the evening.  The staff offered to help me find what I missed, but since I already had one bottle, I decided that was enough for the day.

Friendly staff, good selection and prices made for a pleasant experience.  I forgot to mention they even have shopping carts to help you carry all your items if you decide to browse awhile.

So glad our friend recommended stopping in here after lunch.  It was amazing to see so many options.

Unfortunately tonight I gave them another shot. Turns out I should've left them in the mini graveyard of establishments I've discarded from my rotation. I think their new management is terrible. So let's dive into it, shall we?

Covid: New Jersey's indoor dining is currently at 25% capacity. In here? Expect more like 75%. The booths are closed every-other, but the tables are not. As we received our food, a 3-top was seated right next to us. My mom also spotted the manager walking around to all his regulars and shaking their hands. And don't expect to find hand sanitizer either. If you're taking the pandemic in the slight bit seriously, I would avoid this diner like the plague.

Food: Vanilla milkshake was good but arrived pouring down all sides, so I couldn't change its placement on the table. It should've been wiped off before being brought over. My turkey salad club would've been okay with less black pepper. I asked for it toasted without tomatoes, so it arrived not-toasted *with* tomatoes. Our server did apologize and said that their system was messed up; she had put it in correctly. My mom enjoyed the cornbread and her jumbo lump shrimp meal. The cream of potato soup was nice too.

Check out: The manager should be expecting this review. In case you're not, let me remind you what you did: You literally threw your hands in the air while your condescending high school host argued with my mother. What type of manager behaves like that?

Our bill was $35.19. My mom handed her $40.19, expecting a $5 bill back. Next thing she knew, she saw the host counting out change, so she asked why she was doing that. The host replied that my mom had given her only nine cents rather than nineteen. My mom responded insisting that she gave exact, and the host wasn't budging.

So in case the host reads this: in the future, if you're given change on an amount higher than the bill and it's not exactly right, you should ask, ""Did you mean to give 9?"" There's no way for me to know which one of them was right -- I didn't see my mom counting out her change. And maybe she left the dime on the table? I don't know. All I do know is that I dug into my purse, handed her a dime, and told her that when her ledger is 10 cents over tonight, she'll know why. And the manager, standing behind her, threw his hands up in a mid-air shrug.

If you wanted to ensure a customer wouldn't be returning, you've met your goal. But whatever -- you have plenty of regulars to shake hands with mid-pandemic.

Edit, in response to the posted reply from Michael B.: 

The table next to my booth was not six feet apart. I also noticed no acknowledgement of the handshaking that was going on.

In what world would a guest give change in order to want more change? She should have confirmed the amount before throwing it in the cash register. And you, sir, should not have thrown your hands in the air. You should've done your job and intervened professionally.

I also don't know what you mean about what I find in Monroeville? And you guys didn't correct my club. I had to pull all the tomatoes out myself, and it wasn't toasted.

Not arguing with you anymore, but it's a shame you went on the defense instead of taking responsibility.",2021-01-03 00:32:30,740,3420,

It was towards the end of the week and he rushed clearly on the work which was done. Didn't put new inner or outer oil seals on front driver and pass sides when installing new whee bearings, left grease everywhere on my front end no joke thick sticky grease on control arms, boot, axles everything even the brakes?? The only thing he did right was install my lift kit which I had him do at the same time. Water like 700 getting wheel bearings done here. He was iffy about taking the job on bc of the time frame he was on but insisted he could get it done anyways. Let's just say he didn't do his best job, probably because he thought ""oh he's a dumb 21 year old he'll never know it isn't right"" or whatever goes through mechanics minds when they fuck people. To be totally honest I thought the wheel bearing noise would go away eventually n maybe they had to be ""broken in"". Not the case 2 months later (he blocked my phone from calling his shop after I left him a message which I only said I wanted him to check out my car again). He probably blocked me as I'm not able to call his shop anymore because he was afraid of what might happen.

I ordered many dishes including the Hamachi Carpaccio, broiled seabass, all of the specialty sashimi, and a large assortment of robatayaki. My server was very welcoming and had given me a lot of information about the menu. My first dishes included the carpaccio, specialty yellowtail and specialty salmon. Immediately, I noticed that it was really salty and had a lot of soy sauce in it. I let my server know, to which she said that ""it's supposed to be like that because of the ponzu"" which was a bit odd to say. The food was still flavorful, just too salty. Next, I had the robatayaki - which I noticed was also over salted. There was too much flaky sea salt and it really overwhelmed the other flavors. I had to douse it in mustard and drink copious amounts of water. I had brought it up to my server again, who had told me that ""robatayaki is meant to be a bit salty. I think that izakaya in general is mean to be salty. Even Royal Izakaya, I've found their food to be salty"" to which I didn't really know how to respond. Am I supposed to accept that all my food is going to be salty for the rest of my meal? I had asked if there could be less salt in my upcoming robatayaki, to which she continued ""I think izakaya food is meant to be salty so you can buy more beer.""  I was really appalled by this discussion and felt that my concerns were not being heard. I've had robatayaki, yakitori, and been to multiple izakaya in NYC and never experienced this. Anyway, I trekked through $170 worth of salty food on my own. The flavor was good, but it would have been better if I did not have to constantly drink water to overcome the extreme saltiness.",2021-01-21 03:26:11,372,1729,

Well, I took my 2011 Hyundai Tucson in to Firestone Tire and Service Center in Hendersonville today because my rear door latch was not working properly. The man at the counter said: ""Sure, we'll take a look at it.""
After looking at it, he presented me the option of replacing the latch for a total of $949. I had no idea it was gonna be that expensive, but it is what it is. I explained that I may not keep the car all that much longer so I was not interested in getting it fixed. He then said I would be responsible for the ""diagnostics"" charge. I thought this would be $20 bucks or so. Wrong. He charged me $100.16 for the diagnosis. It would have been more professional when he said they would ""take a look at it"" if he would have told me that there would be a fee and that I should have signed something recognizing that this was the case. He explained that the fee was so high because they had to take the door latch apart and then reassemble it to ""diagnose"" it. Again, the professional thing to do in this situation would have been to ask me for permission to take my door latch apart. I paid for the charge, and I will chalk it up to a lesson learned. I will not be returning to Firestone. I spent $100.16 and still have a broken door latch.

This time I got the tuna. Decently tasty. Appreciated that the tuna salad wasn't salty but it sure is ""wet"". Not sure balsamic is the best dressing for it. 

However, I agree with a previous reviewer that the portions are a bit small. The salads are definitely not 85% full. I poured the croutons in, left the dressing untouched, and it weighed 13.3 ounces lidless. By the way, that's with tuna salad which I assume would be heavier than most other proteins because of the mayo etc. With the pretzel, it does fill me up and I LOVE chopped salads so I'm used to the density factor. But I would agree with the other reviewer that the portion sizes are maybe off. I'm used to other meal salads being two meals for me as I often order yummy salads from breakfast places such as Two Chicks and Sunrise Cafe and they always provide breakfast, lunch, and snack for me. Pegs used to make a wonderful salad but they went to a reduced menu. 

The salad itself tasted fresh and was crunchy as I subbed romaine instead of their house mix of iceberg/spinach. But I watched the guy make a salad from the drive through window and he grabbed the spatula top which touched the food without gloves-they were stored top up in some jar :(  That's gross.

I know they're new but they're not that new. They have some processes to clean up. By the way, the young woman working the drive through was fabulous. Hayley maybe? I weighed the salad because the manager was defending the portions of the salads in a reply. And in all honesty, it's fine for one serving. And I really appreciate the drive-through. If they opened at 7am, I'd buy more salads here instead of Sunrise or Two Chicks simply for the drive through. Pretzel stick is yummy!

I'll be back for sure because seriously, what do you want from a salad?  Tasty, fresh ingredients. Crunch. I do like the container also!  It's easy to handle and eat from.",2021-01-28 23:13:53,430,2011,

Having been to Cane's in the Midwest, I would always rave about them to my family. We went on a weekend trip to Reno and before we left we had to hit up Cane's. There were three families email our group so we decided to get the Hard Hat party pack which includes the following: 50 chicken fingers, 10 Cole slaws, 10 Texas toast and Cane sauce. We added a pan of crinkle cut fries and honey mustard sauce and they provided plates as well. 

We were surprised how fast they completed our order and we waited for 10-15 minutes at the most. No one in our group has ever had Cane's and I was excited to introduce them to Cane's. A few friends commented on the limited menu and mainly consisting of only chicken fingers. I told them it's because unlike most fast food places have a few good items and many mediocre items, Cane's specialize in chicken fingers and they do it right. 

The chicken fingers were exactly how I remembered. They were large size fingers, crunchy yet firm, not oily at all and the chicken itself was soft and moist on the inside. The fries weren't too oily, had the perfect fries crunch and were crinkle cut (which you don't see too often anymore). The Cole slaw is pretty much a standard close slaw and I find people either like it or they don't. I happen to like the close slaw and the cabbage was crunchy and not too over soaked in sauce. The Texas toast had the right amount of garlic and butter and was toasted perfectly. 

The staff was friendly and the restaurant (including the bathrooms) were clean. Overall, a very satisfying eating experience at Cane's. 

We live in Roseville and heard Cane's is going to open a shop near the Galleria Area. We are very excited about this, as now we won't have to wait to go to Reno to enjoy some Cane's. When that shop opens, I will post another review of that location. 

At Cane's you get quality chicken fingers and they don't disappoint. If you're looking for chicken strips/fingers, give Cane's a try. All they do is strips and they do it right!

I was required to give a credit card ahead of time as no shows/late cancels are charged full price. Once I arrived for my appointment I realized they had changed my therapist to someone who isn't able to do the type of pressure I requested. I figured it would still be nice so let it go. However a couple minutes later I got a call from them stating that the person I had been scheduled with was unable to do my massage due to a family emergency and had to leave a few minutes earlier. They stated they couldn't call me earlier due to their phone line being down and they were now using a cell phone. Made no sense but ok. They offered to reschedule me for Wednesday at noon and said they'd add on an enhancement of aromatherapy lotion. I agreed but couldn't help but think that at most spas scented lotion is par for the course and doesn't come with an up charge. Also very interesting considering their inflexible cancellation policy. It would've cost me the full price of a massage if I had cancelled 5 minutes prior but for them it cost a $10 enhancement. 

My appointment itself was mediocre. The room was poorly decorated and therapist was nice but not overly friendly and she rushed - my massage was closer to 45-50 minutes, not 60. She spent very little time on the areas I had highlighted on the check in paperwork. Overall the massage was ok, not bad but also not great. 

Once I finished the woman at the front desk told me I would be charged $115 next time ($55 more than the one time introductory price) unless I subscribed to a monthly membership. How outrageous. Most spas I've been to in the past charge $75-$100 for 60 mins massage, $115 is overpriced and a joke considering the mediocrity of the experience and their poor customer service.

I used to work at chickfila gandy. The work atmosphere is horrible. The managers did not care about the employees health and safety. If i could be completely honest, working here was very detrimental to my mental health. One shift, a co worker felt ill during work and my manager refused to let her leave. I am pretty sure she was running a fever this day. We are also in a middle of a pandemic and people are dying from COVID. If this co worker had COVID, then she would be putting all other staff and guests at risk for contracting it during work hours. Another shift, a co worker threw up, and my manager refused to let her leave because she didn't have a fever. You can have COVID and still be asymptomatic without a fever, but i guess this location is not letting their staff leave fever or no fever now. I would often not get a break for 15 minutes at least during my 6-8 hour shift, often staying later as well. I find that unprofessional that they cannot schedule staff appropriately when they have families and other things besides work to do. Also, not getting a break is a OSHA violation and cause for more errors or hazards in the work place. Another thing is that if we dropped something on the floor, we were told to pick it up, sanitize it and place it back with everything else, which is disgusting. They also do not clean their machines daily. They also cut workers paychecks, which is unreasonable since many have families to feed. 

please people, DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!! what you really should do is call corporate to make changes to this location management wise because if this is happening, then it will be downhill from here.  do yourself a favor and drive the extra mile or so to the south dale mabry location. protect yourself because this chickfila is NOT living up to company purpose and values!",2021-01-16 13:59:58,383,1876,

1) The unit was not properly cleaned prior to our arrival! The bed in the master bedroom was not made, the blankets and a towel were wadded in a pile on the bed!! There also was a dirty glass in the kitchen sink. That is absolutely unacceptable, especially with covid being such an issue and this company advertising how thoroughly they clean and disinfect!!
2) The hot and cold lever on the shower was backward!! Thank God my son didn't get burned!! He knows to turn the water on more toward cold and then adjust to warmer water after he gets in the shower, to avoid getting burned. Thankfully he saw the steam and realized it was hot before getting in!!
Then there were the multiple small issues:
-the TV, modem, cable box and phone were on the floor in the master bedroom
-there was a large stain on the carpet near the nightstand in the master bedroom
-the fan didn't work in the master bedroom (the pull chain was broken off)
-the light didn't work in one closet in the master bedroom
-the remote was taped together in master bedroom
-the carpet was pulling away from the entrance to the master bath, so the tack strip was exposed (not awesome when stepped on)
-the blinds were broken in the master bath
-there was packaging material, including staples on the carpet in the master bedroom
-there was no bag in the vacuum, so the above issue was cleaned up by hand. (Definitely didn't want a staple in my foot!!)
-the cable wasn't working in the bedroom with the twin beds
-the light switch in the dining area was covered in scotch tape‍
-the blinds were broken in the kitchen
-the balcony light didn't work
-the covers were broken off of the outdoor outlet on the balcony

Despite all these issues, they offered NO compensation!! ZERO All they did was say, oh I'm sorry....",2021-01-20 23:21:16,394,1909,

No intro, no I'll be back, no comments from her at all.  I decided I was getting up and leaving at 3 pm but she came by at 2:56 and I made my order.  The lunch special spaghetti and meatballs ($8.99) which included unlimited soup and salad as per the menu.  

I had told the waitress I was starting to think no one had this table.  Well, I guess I triggered her because when she brought my tea she slammed it on the table without comment.  She brought my salad, no cheese, and throughout the meal her attitude was obvious and negative.  She was nasty, I saw her interacting with the table beside me so I knew it was a different attitude towards me.  I had to overtly ask for sweeteners, a refill, and bread sticks.  

So after finish in my meal I asked for my check and she gave me the little machine.  When I saw my bill I realized she'd NOT given me the lunch special (ostensibly because she didn't put my order in within the time frames to get the lunch special) and charged me as you can see below.  So my $8.99 lunch special and an unsweetened iced tea came to over $20.00. 

Normally, I'd have spoken to a manager but there wasn't one in sight during the meal and for the now 25 minutes I've been here watching for one.  Terrible service, terrible staff, terrible experience, and obviously poor management.  

I strongly recommend against going here, I'd give it less than one star if I could.  Also note in the photo they clearly served me a lunch portion spaghetti despite being charged 7.99 plus another 3.49 for meatballs.",2021-01-11 20:38:15,361,1709,

The Garage Food Hall is what I might call industrial epic, an establishment that maintains the historic vibe of the Coca-Cola Bottling Plant yet turns it into a truly Indy indie destination spot that should have no problem attracting tourists and Indy residents alike. 

Technically located at 906 Carrollton just off Mass Avenue, the Garage Food Hall is part of what is truly becoming known as the Bottleworks District. It also includes the shiny new Bottleworks Hotel and the Living Room Theatre. There will also be other spots alongside the Garage. I'd parked on Mass Avenue to pick up my swag bag for this week's Yelpies and then wheeled on over to the Garage to check it out and grab some lunch. It took me a few minutes to figure out the lay-out and where everything is located, perhaps some additional neighborhood signage would be helpful, but it's also fairly nice having it be a little discreet given some limitations currently with health regulations and limited capacity. 

The Garage Food Hall is just that - it's one ginormous food hall with multiple restaurant vendors, a couple service vendors, and a handful of retail vendors. I was a bit worried about this entire complex - I'm one of those folks who isn't really happy with what's happened to Broad Ripple and I feared the same would be true on Mass Avenue. While I might argue Mass Avenue has a few too many apartments, the truth is the Mass Avenue ""neighborhood"" vibe continues and there's been a much more successful effort at maintaining the history of the location. 

The Garage includes food vendors like Clancy's Hamburgers, J's Lobster and Fish Market, La Chinita Poblana, Azucar Morena, Poke Guru, Hard Truth Distilling, Gaucho's Fire, Lick Ice Cream, Abbiocco Pizzeria, Herculean Meal Prep, and soon to arrive Certain Feelings Coffee Company, Blupoint Oyster Bar, and Chapati Beta. 

Brick & Mortar Barbershop is here. Pumkinfish re-opens after closing down their Mass Avenue spot. Becker Supply Co. is also here. I saw at least one woman offering classes in a vacant spot, while there was a corner that offered a couple cornhole games and I believe a table tennis set. On this Saturday that I visited, there was a DJ spinning tunes. 

Right now, Garage is set up for safety with health regulations. Tables are 6' apart it would seem. Staff are cleaning up in a timely manner and super friendly. There's a mix of taller tables and shorter tables - Geronimo has a solid record of truly accessible establishments and this spot is pretty darn good. There's disinfectant stations around, as well. 

If you've ever been to the Ironworks area, there's a definite similarity in the vibe but also some definite differences. I'd say this is definitely aiming for a younger crowd. 

They do have their paid parking lot and it looks like there's another parking lot going in not far away. The Bottleworks Hotel is already open and vibrant, while the Living Room Theatre opened this past week and is sort of working on a lo-capacity vibe. It's actually a great opportunity to work out the kinks of business and be ready to go once pandemic life calms down. 

The price range varies quite a bit here in terms of both shopping and eating. I'd plan on a $10-15 range minimum and it can go quite a bit higher at some of the more upper tier joints. Of course, with Lick Ice Cream here you should probably just go ahead and plan on dessert. 

This is beautiful, accessible, consistent with the neighborhood vibe, the employees are super friendly, parking is convenient, and the food options are culturally diverse and truly worth being a destination spot here in downtown Indy. 

I'll be back soon.",2021-01-17 17:22:23,753,3903,

I try to avoid a particular cashier who really just seems to despise being there. Shrs overcharged me several times, talks so that I can not hear her, wont tell me when I need to insert or remove my debit card and this last time when I said "" do I need to put my card in now?""

We visited New Orleans and Florida between Christmas to New Years.  

I woke early the morning in New Orleans and took our dog for an early walk around a quiet downtown; the one park was very dog friendly.  They also saw a place where water was flowing gently up from between the crack in the sidewalk... must be a broken water main under water.

We went back upstairs to wake my wonderful wife and our kids.  As they got moving, the dog wanted to walk some more so we did... and our daughter was moving quickly enough to come with us.

Our dog is named Backes, for hockey player David Backes - Blues, Bruins, and now the Mighty Ducks.

Backes immediately walked next door, to Streetcar Cafe.  He must have really smelled something good because he led us straight from the hotel to next door at the Streetcar Cafe.  We were unsure about going, in, but the hostess quickly came to the door, welcoming us with a big smile.

The people immediately welcomed him and us in, and they had fun petting him, and they gave him a bowl of water; the other guests were smiling, too.  Backes was very excited but soon calmed down.   

We ordered bacon, sausage and beignets and took them in the room... where they were gone in minutes.

Oh so good.

I've had beignets before but these were a first for the kids... well made, toasty warm and with powdered sugar on top... couples with bacon and sausage and we were so happy.

And we ordered extra sausage and bacon for Backes and his tail was till waggin' from the attention the staff at Streetcar Cafe gave him.

What a great way to start our day!!!


Thank you, Streetcar Cafe!",2021-01-21 07:52:47,352,1667,

Reason for the three star review of what could be a five star place:
1 for good food and value
1 for overall very nice wait staff (once you get past the desk)
1 for atmosphere and ambiance

The negatives are for the reception experiences, worse this year with the closures.  We all know that restaurants can't be at full capacity, and at the same time fewer people are dining.  So, why the attitude?

For the past two years wife and I have been ""every-other-monthers"" at 59 Almshouse-- not regulars, but consistent.  It was our anniversary spot and a favorite place to bring visiting guests and family.  Earlier this year after the first spring lockdown was lifted we stopped in, and an extremely frosty hostess (who seemed to be annoyed that we were interfering with her chatting with the other one) told us ""we're SO booked right now, etc.,"" I took my wife's arm to leave, and ran into a man waiting tables who may have been a manager. So I asked him and he very nicely told us ""I think we can get you in,"" went over and said something to the the pair at the desk, and we were seated in about a minute. He also waited on us and we had another nice meal (their American burger, my favorite).  Since was our first time dining out in Pennsylvania since the initial lockdown it was special for us, and he made it right.

I'll never judge a good place on a single bad experience, but it happened again almost identically maybe two months later: hostile, snobby reception, then friendly waiters and great food. But again, willing to cut the place some slack.

So about a month after that we had a family member visiting and wanted to do something special for her last evening.   I called and got the same snarling treatment over the phone, ""there's NOTHING tonight, we're COMPLETELY booked."" Then a hang-up before I could even ask if there was indoor available much later.  

Three strikes as they say, and sharp contrast to the next calls we made to local restaurants.  One was also booked with no seating-- but they were genuinely sorry they couldn't seat us and nicely asked us to please try us again next time.  The second was equally friendly: ""come by right now, we can get you in.""  

That's all it takes, Almshouse.  When things were more open we ate out regularly and had lots of local options (Tony's is a favorite, also Luca's, Seam Pub, etc.) and would rather spend our money in a place that acts like they want us there.  At some point things will open fully and something called ""competition"" will be back in force-- smiles now are money in the bank for that future.  I hope you can address this, we'd love to feel welcome and come back at some point.  But in scanning some of the other reviews I see the phrase ""rude hostess"" going back a year so it's not like we're the first to report it.",2021-01-03 18:28:03,625,2923,

Chris' demeanor and the flavor of the initial conversation was exactly what you want when looking at a place to buy a car. Welcoming, accommodating, and appreciative. Instead of dealing with Chris, as GM, on my call to set up an appointment to look at vehicles, I was directed to Jonathan Ault. Again, a wonderful conversation. I told Jonathan basically what we were looking for, and he welcomed us to come and said ""You'll have the best car buying experience you've ever had"". I've had quite a few, and in short, I can tell you, the expectation that Jonathan provided was met and exceeded 110%. When we arrived, we met Ben Webster, who ultimately was the sales professional that took care of us. The Covid precautions were very adequate. Everyone working at the dealership were wearing masks, and the 2001 Subaru Outback that we wanted to look at was clean and waiting for us when we got there. The test drive was great, and the information provided by Ben was very thorough. Chris and Jonathan both came by to introduce themselves and check in on us. Great touch. When it came down to ""the deal"", the offer presented to us was actually better than I expected, as I was trading in a fairly low mileage vehicle. We were so excited not to have to worry about haggling and were just plain satisfied with the offer, which we accepted. Top to bottom from the first phone call, to driving our car off the lot, and even in the support after the sale, this was indeed, the best car buying experience that my wife and I have ever had, by far. I highly recommend Subaru of Gallatin, Chris, Jonathan, Ben, and all the team of professionals there. You've definitely made believers out of us!!",2021-01-03 18:18:01,375,1765,

Reading the other reviews, I couldn't help but notice how  markedly out of place the few the one or two star reviews appear, as the vast majority give Dave Scholl Automotive an enthusiastic five stars.  Additionally, what stands out even more is that the negative ones are virtually identical, sharing the same complaint, which is absolutely NOTHING to do with the quality of Mr. Scholl's work. Rather their displeasure primarily stems from the fact that Dave is not an overly gregarious individual who does not relish engaging in small talk with his customers. It is not his nature to come bounding out, beaming ear to ear, waxing lyrical about the beautiful weather we're having, and ""How 'bout them Dodgers?!"". Myself, I respect that he is simply a reserved individual: perhaps a bit terse - but polite, and entirely genuine. You will not be paying bargain basement prices for work done here, but Dave is trustworthy and fair.  When I am hurtling down the 101 in my 3,200 lb Volvo, going.......um, the speed limit of course (haha), I'm not thinking to myself ""Boy, I sure wish I'd gone to 'El Cheapo Express' and saved seventy bucks on my brakes!"" Lastly, presumably Dave does not encourage us to expound upon our theories regarding the source and/or solution to a problem because - now I'm only guessing here - but if we are bringing our cars to him we are probably not master mechanics - otherwise we'd be taking care of any issues ourselves. Don't get the wrong idea, Dave Scholl is a very nice and friendly individual. But he Dave is also a professional; he knows what he is doing and just wants to get on with his work. His time is valuable and labor is expensive: do you expect your lawyer to chat merrily with you - and every other client they see that day for 20 minutes (and for free)? It is unreasonable and absurd for one to expect Mr. Scholl to do so either.

You can tell the normal noise from the excessive noise. I only had to ask my neighbor one time to quiet down, and they were very polite about it. There is also a courtesy officer that you can contact after hours should it rise to that level--it never did with me. The walk score is fairly low here as well since there are a lack of places to walk especially with a dog. It's a short trip to walk around the entire complex and really no way to walk outside the complex since you have big streets on both sides of the complex with no sidewalks. That means be prepared to take your dog to local parks or elsewhere for a decent walk. Also, the sidewalks are small which is strange so you constantly have to get off the sidewalk and back on because there is not enough room for people to pass going both ways. And, people drive way too fast inside the complex so they need to put on the brakes and calm down. On the plus side, the dog park was a big hit with my dogs, although the occasional aggressive dog would show up--but you get to know the crazy ones and to avoid. Now that we have a house and a backyard we already miss some of the friends we met at the dog park. The folks that live in this community are friendly. The location is good as it's far enough away from the nonsense downtown but close enough to take your friends to Broadway when they visit. The maintenance team is excellent and fast. Kaylee in the leasing office has been extremely helpful since day one so I am sure she will move onto bigger and brighter things real soon. Overall, the pros balance out the cons, and it is certainly the nicest apartment community I have ever been apart of. The food trucks are great as well, especially during Covid.

At just about the same time, I saw Nicole S's review for Hard Truth Hills on Yelp.  Turns out I had to go into Indy this morning so we checked out the place today for lunch.

I read all the reviews and indeed parking was a challenge for us.  First I tried parking on Ninth St. where it looks like it is free because there are no meters but there is a kiosk to pay for parking.  You enter in your license plate number and pay by card only; it does not accept cash.  Unfortunately we could not get it to read the four different cards we tried.  The pay machine looks brand new but it seemed to struggle with whether it wanted us to leave the card or pull it out.

So we tried the parking lot right there on Ninth St. which the sign says is Lot No. 4.  Getting in was no problem, but getting out could have been better.  The recording says, ""Insert Card"" but doesn't tell you how much you have to pay.  The screen was blank and did not have the sun shining directly on it.  There was a ""receipt"" slot but no receipt was given.  But this place is new so we will give them time to iron out their growing pains which I hear some have already been.

So there are still many places not open yet in various stages of being ready to open with signs of coming soon.  It was not crowded at all at noon on a Thursday but was getting more crowded after a couple of hours when we left.  I will bet for dinner times more tables are going to be needed as more places open.  But in favor of The Garage Food Hall, there are plenty of attendants cleaning and busing tables constantly and also ensuring germ safety.

A friend of mine knows someone that works here and the information I am hearing is that coming soon will be a coffee and dessert shop, a soup/salad/sandwich shop, a BBQ joint, Axels, a 20 tap beer bar, an Indian and Pakistani cuisine spot and the Blue Point oyster house.  And there are still more units to build out.  I suspect this place will be very popular and it will always attract the repeat customers back.  

We tried J's Lobster & Fish Market and Lick Ice Cream.  See their individual Yelp pages for those reviews.",2021-01-21 23:00:46,470,2221,

Oy. This place is awesome. 

One of the additions is the relocated Lick Ice Cream, a former Circle City Industrial Complex business now housed inside the Food Hall. 

Lick is a locally owned micro-creamery that uses organic dairy and made from scratch ingredients to create rather masterful ice cream concoctions. They offer ice cream cones, dishes, shakes, ice cream sandwiches, and a handful of other things. 

This is an ideal location for Lick. It seems like the Bottleworks management has made a tremendous effort to create a diverse menu and to do what they can to ensure everyone's success. Their stand is a little bit awkward as it's at the end of an aisle and in the current pandemic it's a little difficult to maintain social distancing while also making it obvious you're in line. Fortunately, everyone was polite and it worked out just fine. 

The Food Hall is pretty good with access - they have a parking lot (paid) with accessible spots and all the entries are level to the ground. The Hall has a mix of taller and shorter tables. Right now, everything is well distanced - this keeps everyone safe, but it also means you might have to look a little bit for a table. However, I had little difficulty finding a wheelchair friendly table. 

The Bottleworks complex has people cleaning quite frequently. I noticed that anytime someone left a table, someone was there right away to clean and disinfect. Likewise, they were very proactive about removing trash. 

I ordered a regular scoop of milk chocolate. It was a healthy serving coming in at right about $5.45. They have a small scoop that comes in less than a five spot. They had about a dozen or so flavors available. As expected, the ice cream was wonderful with a sublime chocolatey flavor that lingered even after I'd left. 

Of course, that might also have been the chocolate on my mouth.

Seriously, it's nice to see Lick get this terrific spot and while it's indoors it felt safe and distanced. Everyone was masked and disinfectant stations were throughout the complex (but not in a way that ruined the decor - very tastefully done). 

While it doesn't appear that quite everything in the Food Hall is locally owned, several of the options are and it's a joy to see. There's ethnic diversity and multiple options I can't wait to try. I'll definitely be returning to Lick and most likely getting a bit more adventurous with my taste buds in the future. 

The person working today was super friendly and hospitable. Locally owned and high quality ice cream? Count me in. I'll for sure be back.",2021-01-16 23:36:30,550,2769,

GiGi is a very rude/misunderstanding business owner. Paying clients are not at the top priority for this business. GiGi seems to lose her temper instantly when questions and/or services are properly examined by clients for verification. I feel very sorry for her staff and hope her actions do not further affect their occupations. GiGi is not understanding and immediately is overwhelmed if any questioning is involved by customers. Her attitude is very negative and is not welcoming what so ever. I do not understand how she has been able to keep this business open without changing this aspect completely. My Fiancé was gifted a facial as her pregnancy gift. She called a couple times, as there was no answer on the other end. No voicemail command was available. After she was finally in contact with GiGi, she was immediately very rude about the entire situation. She continuously made rude comments about how many times she was contacted. She had no apprehension what so ever towards a paying customer (that was being very polite and understanding). She even began to raise her voice and instantly stated she would not permit a refund. She also immediately stated that she canceled all existing appointments for the individual in which issued and payed for the gift certificate. I was standing right next to my fiancé during the entire call and heard every second of it. Gigi was very rude from the start. My fiancé even has the screen shots of the calls, which were 4 minutes apart with no voicemail options. If GiGi is to rebuttal, I would love to see screen shots of her call log. As far as Yelp goes, this is my first review. I am only leaving this review as GiGi is very disrespectful. The only rebuttal she continuously refers to is her voicemail. The voicemail isn't the issue what so ever; it is the way she handles her wrong doings without repentance towards her potential clientele. Once again, I was there for the entire conversation and heard everything, she is a very rude and inconsiderate person. Her only repent towards the argument in general was her voicemail, there was no compensation or worry for the customer. At the end of the day, be patient with and caring with your customers. I noticed right before me, there was another review regarding how rude and negative GiGi is.

It's a brand new location and the waiting room is very nice, I was impressed. I only had a low tire pressure indication so I figured it would be a quick fix, however it took about an hour to let me know the tire could not be repaired and they would have to order a new tire since they did not have a matching one in stock. Apparently, the tire was not safe to drive on because they took it off and put on my donut spare. Okay, fine. The assistant manager gave me her card and said they would call the next day and that they kept my alloy wheel and would mount the tire so all we had to do was swap out the donut for the newly mounted tire. 

Got a phone call the next day saying my wheel was ready for pick up. When I showed up I was immediately charged $207.00 for the new tire, and they were like ""Thanks, you are all set!"" I was like ""Um, wait a second, I still need the wheel put on my car!""

""Ohhhh, well it's gonna be several hours till we can work you in, I don't even have a free bay at the moment."" 

I explained the previous day's conversation and how they kept the alloy so the new tire could be mounted etc. and that it was supposed to be a quick swap.

They did take care of me and it was done pretty fast so I felt somewhat relieved in the end.

Online reservations were easy and we were delighted to get in New year's Eve at 7:30 p.m. We actually did arrive a bit early but they were willing to accommodate and seat our party of four at a comfortable table near a window. This place is gorgeous. Simple yet elegant and thoughtfully decorated. 

We tried an array of cocktails. All were good. My favorite cocktail of all time is a New York sour. This is not on the menu but they were able to recreate their version and it hit the spot. 

For our appetizers and entrees:

Chicken liver paté 5/5.  Really, really enjoyable. Portioned out on four pieces of wedged toast and caramelized onions. Geez it was delicious.

Pimento cheese 5/5. Again, they did this right. I'm a southern girl so I know my way around this dish. They used the right amount of pimento and the perfect consistency. The house made chips held up nicely and were a great accompaniment.

Octopus 4/5.  I've had more tender renditions of this dish. It did not pack a ton of flavor but overall enjoyable.

Bacon wrapped dates 4/5. This has never been a favorite of mine but the table did enjoy this.  I would probably skip this on my next visit but it's worth a try. 

House special black grouper with cauliflower puree 5/5. My friend and I were filling up pretty quickly from the appetizers so asked our server if it was possible to split this dish. No problem, not only did the chef split it and plate it perfectly, they also split the bill as well. 

Tamarind glazed pork shank 5/5. This was my husband's dish and he cleaned his plate.  There was a flavor explosion in this dish.  The pork was so tender and slow cooked. 

Speaking of service, Amy was phenomenal. Very personable, she took her time at the table with us discussing our best choices for cocktails and food dishes. She really is a pleasure. 

This experience was perfection. Very happy to have rung in the new year with this as my last dining experience of 2020. Barterhouse is going down easily as one of my top 5 restaurants in Tampa Bay.",2021-01-01 17:44:18,434,2150,
WC3KJGnNdiBmwAGaPsawfQ,FNlbsqYsAJQA03oCazLrcg,dQJGkmxqHxowT8DnxioJZg,5,1,0,0,"Came here a little hesitant because of the fairly high price for the tacos when there's other places that sell them cheaper so I told myself I would be stern on them in this review. And they passed the test. The tacos were delicious. Your best bet is to get the Combo Cartel which lets you mix and match three tacos, along with fries & melted cheese, and charro beans. For $15, that's actually pretty good bang for your buck. The fried fish and fried shrimp tacos were awesome. The aioli they cover both with was so good. The carne asada taco was ok but that's my fault because I'm a picky eater and basically got everything off the taco but the steak lol. I would like to go back and try the other tacos because if they were as good as the shrimp and fish then my stomach is already craving it. The beans were really good too. They should probably offer you a spoon for that though (they only give a fork and knife). The fries were decent. The melted cheese on them dries up pretty quickly. But if you eat them fresh, they're much better. Service here was exceptional. The manager of the store came by multiple times to make sure all was good. She was very sweet. We also had a male server who was really nice and informed us that a ""refill"" of the salsa and chips would have been more which was very nice of him to let us know before just surprising us with the charge on the bill. I do think they do not offer enough salsa with the chips though. But it's free so I guess you can't complain too much. My only other slight gripe is the cups are small. Fancy, but small. So you will likely be constantly needing refills if you drink a lot with your food like I do. However, me and my date only had water so I do not know if they offer larger cups if you get a fountain drink. The inside was beautiful. Great ambiance and perfect for date nights. All servers had masks and soon as a party would leave they would sprint to the table to clean it. Was pretty funny to see haha. Taco Del Cartel left a good impression on me and I will certainly be back.",2021-01-09 05:07:10,445,2048,

I usually give a little scene setup before diving into my reviews, but the Korean Cheese Steak from Zenwich in Central West End was just too good for me not to start gushing over!

The meat on the sandwich is Korean style marinated beef brisket. While most cheesesteaks feature shaved meat, the thick cuts of meat on this sandwich made for a hearty mouthful with each bite. I'm not well versed in Korean food, so I couldn't really pick out or describe the flavors other than THEY WERE AMAZING! The meat was tender and the wok-charred mushrooms were a perfect complement to this creative take on a classic sandwich. 

On to the fries. Yes please! The truffle seasoning at first was off putting just because it's such a strong scent. But the taste was really chilled out by the starchy goodness of the fries. I'm a sucker for really thin crispy fries, so these little morsels were right up my alley. And not to mention, the aioli that was served with the fries was like a magical concoction of happiness and joy. I actually dipped my sandwich in it a few times because I loved it so much.

Last tip is the drink. I had Sangaria Macchairi Green Tea Unsweetened. Not totally sure what it was, but it was refreshing. I savored every drop. Definitely try it when you visit Zenwich.

Ordering from Zenwich is so easy online. There are photos and descriptions of everything they offer. My order was ready very quickly and their safety precautions were top notch too! Can't wait to go back so I can try their ramen.",2021-01-07 22:45:10,338,1652,

Appetizer: Crispy Calamari was absolutely delicious. Perfectly fried. The sweet chili sauce was amazing and the portion was definitely enough to share. Ordering this again for sure! 

Entree: 10 oz Filet cooked medium rare. The steaks were cooked to and seasoned perfectly. I could of cut it with a fork. The chimichurri sauce was good, the blue butter was great, and the stk bold sauce did not make me a fan. The ark bold is like a sweet bbq sauce and I was expecting more of an a-1 type sauce. So far, this has been the best steak I have had when compared to Kayne Prime and Bourbon Steakhouse. 

Sides: Parmesan Truffle Fries were my instant choice. I really wasn't a fan. They fries are very thick and give you more of a baked potato taste instead of a French fry. I won't order these again. 

Sweet Corn Pudding was amazing. Enough to share, but I promise you won't want to share. It is sweet, but paired very well with the steaks.

Drinks: My fiancé had 2 old fashions. She said they were strong but extremely good. The orange slice was a nice touch.

Dessert: Bag of donuts were amazing. I didn't even though the chocolate sauce. I dipped them into the dulce de leche and the raspberry sauce. So fresh and soooo good!

Service: I don't think I could take more than a 2 sips of my water before it was refilled. They were on their A game and it was amazing. They were also very knowledgeable of the menu and super friendly!

I still want to try out all the other steakhouses in the city, but so far STK is my favorite!",2021-01-22 19:26:50,348,1608,

Me and some girlfriends decided we'd give this place a try so I made reservations on Tuesday, when I walked in on Friday night the host did not have my reservation written down. Luckily she still sat us. Our server Fernando was nice and energetic. It was easy to order - choose what seafood you would like in your bag, then the sauce (you can mix it up) and last you'll decide what heat level you'd like. I was conflicted between the mild and medium, Fernando offered to bring me a side of medium sauce but he didn't mention it was an extra $2. We also ordered a michelada but instead of the $35 one, Fernando offfered a $12 michelada which is just a regular michelada. It was actually $12.99 on my receipt. The specialty drinks cost $14.99, I thought that was a bit pricey. But the beer were fairly priced. 
The food was OK. I ordered a lb of snow crab legs, lb of head off shrimp and a lb of sausage with mixed parsley lemon pepper and garlic butter sauce... pretty plain but next time I plan to order different sauces!
The restaurant was clean and the tables were perfectly distanced from each other. And the service was great! If you plan to come here be prepared to spend some $$$$. Overall good experience!!",2021-01-30 19:14:17,303,1420,

So the ridgeline, my truck, sits there 20 minutes in line. Then they go and move it to the side. Then 15 minutes later they add it to another line and it sits there for 30 minutes. Bare with me this issue is not what the problem is. They change the oil. They come tell me the drain plug is stripped after two hours of waiting. So they have to see if it can be fixed. They bring a bunch of drama about they may need to put in a new drain pan. So I tell them if they can't tap it put a fumoto valve in it so it permanent. He says yes he has heard of it, but we don't normally do it. So anyway they finally put in something like a helicoil in so the drain bolt doesn't leek. So I go to pay them and the let me kinda look at the notes on anything they find. A week before I changed my air filter and in cabin air filter on my truck myself. I seen on the work paper I have a slight oil leak on my valve cover gasket. So the give me my paperwork. It says battery good in the green verbally he said my battery is bad. On my windshield it says brakes good, tires good, battery bad. On my paperwork it says brakes in bad shape needs immediate attention. Tires good. Filters need immediate attention. It says on my paperwork in cabin air filter bad and air filter bad. Somebody is wrong. So if you want to take your vehicle here, there is no telling what is done proper. Also, what needs to be done. I spent 5 hours in the waiting room, and outside, before a seat became available just to get a simple oil change. I will not be back. What a shame that the Honda corporation allow this facility to operate with so many bad reviews. Lesson learned for me. I even called after I received a text from them. I told the receptionist what happened. I said I am fixing to write my review on Yelp she said a manager will call me. Still waiting for that. So it cost me about $170 for an oil change and tapped oil pan with new drain plug. The person did give a coupon of 15% off which I am greatful, but the drama and no communication in the 5 hour wait doesn't make up the difference or my time. By the way they get a lot of their parts from locale dealers because he said that is where he would get my oil pan if needed. If you go here lots of luck!!! Here is an update I went to have my battery checked. It turns out the battery is very good just a loose battery terminal. Never will I take it back to here.

The first time I visited the salon, the tech was roughly shaping and over all handling my hands in an impolite manner and it almost felt like she was rushing. I had reached out to them via Instagram initially regarding the design I wanted and the price and secured an appointment time and date about a week in advance. The Day of my appointment: the tech had informed me that they did not possess the materials to create the design I wanted and asked me to chose another design. This happened AFTER someone had already put the base for acrylic nails on. Had I known they didn't have the materials prior to my appointment I would have been better prepared with another design option or wouldn't have gotten my nails done there. I quickly found another design that I liked luckily but the tech did not execute it how imagined but I was so flustered that I just left with what she gave me. I was angry because I left with something completely different from what I wanted. SECOND VISIT: I wanted to give the salon the benefit of the doubt that they wouldn't treat me so unprofessionally a second time but BOY WAS I WRONG. I went to the salon again in preparation for my upcoming birthday celebration and I was given a different nail tech this time. I showed her the design that I wanted from my previous visit and asked ""can you do this design and do you have the materials? Because last time y'all ran out of clear tips and that's why I couldn't get it."" And she responded...that she didn't need clear tips for that design. So we both agreed to go with that design. She put on the tips and shaped my nails. It wasn't until she put on the polish did the tech realize that she couldn't execute the design I wanted yet again. At this point I wanted to cry in chair because I had things to do after I got to the salon and was faced with two options. Either keep the ugly design she had on my nails through my birthday to save time but hate looking at them or change the color. The tech didn't want to take the color off so she was pushing for me to keep the design but add a different design to it. Everything she added wasn't cute, it was further wasting my time and frustrating me (the tech could clearly tell from my responses and my attitude I was not a happy camper). I finally decided on choosing a basic color with no design in the end and the tech was rushing to get me out of the salon at that point. I will NEVER come back to this disappointing salon again. She left nail polish on my fingers tips and did fully remove the ugly color she originally applied before I requested the color change. She knew I was unsatisfied so she only charged me $43 which I still believe to be too much for all the drama i experienced in the seat. I highly DO NOT

We headed over to the bar and grill to have some drinks and food before bowling. The bartender told us angrily that we would have to wait 20 minutes before he would have time to take our drink order. We had a long wait for our lane anyways so we had no problem with this. He eventually came around to take our order. We received our drinks the same time our lane was ready, it took a full hour. After getting the text our lane was ready, we headed out. The server screamed at us to finish our drinks before heading out. We apologized saying we didn't know and had just got them and were forced to chug them. He then yelled at us again to pay with him because he could not transfer our tab, which we did and apologized again. We asked him to send our food to our lane when it was ready. When we got to our lane, the waitress at the lane said the bartender had told her we already got our food (this is 2 minutes after he agreed to have our food sent to the lane). The manager came over and refunded us the food saying we allegedly didn't get it, basically siding with the bartender without ever hearing our side. I told him this could all be solved if he sends our food over here we don't even want our money back and he again spoke to us in a disrespectful tone and waked away in the middle of my sentence. We all left feeling disrespected. Usually have a great time, but the staff was terrible and the manager did nothing about it.  Been a server for four years and have never left a bad review about a staff member but his behavior was not acceptable. Pricing was good and lane waitress was great.",2021-01-16 17:34:13,351,1646,

As we have done with our Mexican food recommendations, https://www.yelp.com/collection/uhtPpaJoVOAuUc8a1wk10A, our findings will be published when we get through enough chewing.

The meal starts with a complimentary bowl of hot & sour soup for two that has lots of black pepper in it.  It will definitely take the chill off during the winter. 

We ate ""in"".  We ordered the Pad Thai, House Chicken w/noodles and Beef with Broad Flat Rice Noodles.  All were big portions and definitely done in a Cantonese Chinese style.  A lot of fresh flavors and a focus on sauce.  This isn't Thai or Mandarin or Hunan.

It is no exaggeration that it is ""one man. one wok"" in the back doing the cooking.  Each dish comes out as he makes it.  It is a refreshing change from the places where everything comes crashing on to the table at one time. 

The photos of the dishes were taken after we had started eating and do not look as pretty as when they came out.  We were hungry.

Important note: each dish can be made with 0-4 stars of heat (spice).  We got 1x and trust that it may take 3-4 stars before we would consider the dish as spicy.  Next time we are going to order everything as a 3x and see what happens.

Lots of takeout orders here, so you may find yourself behind some of them when you sit down.  Lunch from 11:30 to 2 pm has some very attractive prices for a no-nonsense lunch.  Call and order ahead for a sitdown lunch.",2021-01-19 19:05:12,309,1511,

The theatre was built in 1916 in a Neo-Classical Revival style and can seat 1,660 people. The theatre offers its hall, lobbies, and Wood Room for rent. 

The theatre includes a main floor, balcony, and stage terrace. There is a parking garage connected by covered awning. For most events, you can expect to pay $10, though there may be some variation. 

Seating for the event is comfortable and there is accessible seating available. The front entrance has your typical wooden doors (with glass in the center). Given the age of the building, it's not surprising that these are heavier than usual doors, though during event nights they are often open. Anyplace you need to go for a show is accessible. I've actually never been backstage, so I can't speak to accessibility of the stage itself. 

The Hilbert Circle Theatre hosts ISO shows, Yuletide Celebration, the Metropolitan Youth Orchestra, and educational programs. Mayor Hogsett had his inaugural event here that I also attended. 

The acoustics here are sublime and ideally suited to an orchestra. I attended a Bobby McFerrin/ISO concert here that was amazing even when it was just McFerrin's voice. 

If you're like me, you tend to love the older theatres and the Hilbert Circle Theatre is very much one. I did an event not only ago where I wheeled around Monument Circle a couple hundred times and each time I passed the theatre I just had to stop and look at it. 

Irvington Group artist Clifton Wheeler designed the pastoral-themed mural over the marquee. In 1928, the theatre played host to Indy's first ever film with sound - The Jazz Singer (No, silly. Not the Neil Diamond one). By the 1940's, the theatre was hosting big bands. The theatre fell into disrepair in the 1970s before ISO decided to call it home in 1982 and opened there in 1984. It was renamed the Hilbert Circle Theatre due to the generosity of Stephen and Tomisue Hilbert. In 2013, the theatre replaced its hall seating with a grant from Lilly Endowment that increased comfort and accessibility while maintaining its historic integrity. You can also arrange for a tour of the Hilbert Circle Theatre.",2021-01-11 19:58:46,457,2377,

Tonight we ordered In from PitaLuv and I will say I was not only impressed, I was FLOORED!! Start to finish! Where do I begin? At the beginning, I suppose! First off, ordering online was super easy, they said the order would be ready by 6 and it was literally waiting for us hot & fresh, when we arrived. I will say I can't wait till we can actually dine in, because the inside of the restaurant was done really nice, They have tables outside as well. Eggplant fries were delicious, and the tzatziki dip that came with them was in my opinion PERFECT! Mac & cheese bites were very very tasty, kids loved them, and so did the adults.  Mini-spinach pies were also phenomenal. So now the salads, I had a Greek Salad, and my wife also had a Greek salad with shrimp. Shrimp cooked perfectly, not overdone, and well seasoned. Salads had plenty of toppings and literally not a wilted piece of lettuce. The salad dressing they made for us was phenomenal. Perfect mix of olive oil, vinegar and lemon, with just the right amount of seasonings, that didn't overdo the salad allowing me to taste every bite. The dolmades were an awesome touch, not gonna lie. Now the gyro, easily one of the best gyros I've had, and this includes tarpon. Fresh cut gyro meat, not boxed, and plenty of it! Plenty of fresh vegetables and of course their amazing tzatziki. We also got to try some of their avgolemono soup and it too was full of flavor, and very satisfying. Desert we had 2 of their mini key lime pies, and they were delicious! Not too sugary, and they tasted just like REAL Key lime pies. If you've had one, you know what I mean. They don't compare to that store bought garbage. One thing that ABSOLUTELY stands out from this establishment that you NEVER see is the personalization they put into the food preparation. To go silverware is wrapped with their seal ""Handmade with love  "" so was my Gyro. The last time I saw personalization like this, and ownership was in Greece when I visited the last time over 15 years ago! I'm not going to lie, I've read all your reviews, I've watched the posts go up about PITALUV, I've seen it, and today on my way home from work I decided today was the day! I'm so glad we gave them a shot for the first time because they were absolutely phenomenal!! I was upset when Little Greek shut down, because they were our Go-to. Not anymore, PITALUV all the way!

My sister surprised me with a huge box of desserts for my birthday and I couldn't have been happier. Vegan or not, I'd highly recommend this place.

Spinach Jawn: Omgggg  my sister got me this as a bday breakfast surprise and WOW it was amazing. The pastry is super flaky and the spinach was well seasoned. I like mine heated up slightly. I would happily pay the $5 bridge toll to go from NJ into Philly just for this pastry alone.

Vanilla N' Vanilla Cupcake: A classic vanilla cupcake that's perfect for birthdays. The cake is super dense so this is quite filling, and the frosting is fluffy and sweet.

Coconut Snowball Cupcake: This was the crowd favorite of the desert spread! The chocolate cake was moist and fluffy, and the coconut icing was amazing. It tasted like buttercream. I don't even like chocolate cake but I could eat 10 of these.

Cannoli: My first vegan cannoli! These were really good, though they definitely taste like Tofutti cream cheese haha. They could have been a little sweeter in my opinion, but are still a great option for an Italian dessert.

Snickerdoodle: A classic snickerdoodle cookie. These were bigger than my hand! They're more on the hard side instead of soft & chewy, but they're not crunchy. They basically melt in your mouth. The amount of cinnamon and sugar is perfect.

Double Chocolate Brownie: This was like fudge! Super rich and filled with chocolate chips. You only need a small piece to satisfy your chocolate craving, so this great to share. It would be amazing heated up and topped with some vanilla ice cream.

The McReeky: Amazing vegan version of a McMuffin! I like how you can request them not to be heated up for takeout, then I baked it at home so it was extra warm and fresh. Great taste & great price at only $7.

Coffee Cake: Perfect for breakfast or dessert! This is a vanilla cake with a delicious cinnamon crumble topping. It's dense and not too sweet. I ended up sharing (regrettably) and nobody expected it was vegan!",2021-01-20 18:08:56,430,2083,

When we went it was all decked out for Christmas, including window displays, tons of garland lights and trees, as well as a swan sleigh to take photos in. It is so magical, especially at the holidays with the most comfortable couches and lounge chairs lined up at each table for you to eat.

I had never tasted more than the desserts at Cake Bake, but this time I got dinner as well as drinks to enjoy. The winter sangria had just the right amount of sweetness with a skewer of cranberries to top it off; super refreshing. They have a ton of great options for entrees. For my meal I went with the choose two so I could try a couple of items. The poached pear salad was the perfect combination of sweet and savory between the pear, prosciutto and gorgonzola cheese. Of course in true Parisian cafe fashion I had to try the ham and brie sandwich. The bread given it was gluten free was more like traditional sandwich bread, although I was hoping for a gluten free baguette it was still good and seemed to be toasted. The brie wasn't too overpowering making for a great taste between all of the flavors.  

To end the night I tried one of the seasonal lattes; Cake Bake uses Illy espresso. The latte was incredibly rich in flavor and had fun sparkles as well as brown sugar and was the perfect size to end the night - no larger than a teacup. Of course I had to take home a piece of cake to enjoy since we left completely stuffed. The black and white cake is to die for! It literally tastes like a fluffy cloud (or really good version of a Hostess cake). 

One item to note is just to be prepared to spend a lot if you are getting more than dessert. A slice of cake can run $14-16, as well as a single cocktail. For the experience and atmosphere Cake Bake provides, it is well worth it.",2021-01-01 05:24:12,407,1963,

With so many 5 star reviews, I expected knowledgeable staff, or at the least a clean and stocked store. Upon my arrival, I found a tiny parking lot not even big enough to back out of or turn around in. A very sketchy location, but saw a couple cars and against my better judgement, I went in. I was immediately in what appeared to be a hoarders wonderland, surrounded by a sea of unopened boxes piled on top of what seemed to be a dirty floor in a poorly lit room, much smaller than a studio apartment. The photos posted by others in the past are still accurate on the chaos occurring currently. Three guys were inside, none of which properly masked, one noteably older than the others who gave off the impression that he was the owner. I explained that my current vape pen was overheating while charging and the battery life had decreased drastically lately, and for safety reasons I was looking to buy a new piece. The younger guy ""helping"" me walked over to a shelf in the back seeming very unsure and stood for a moment before asking the owner if he could show me a box. I squeezed past (and I'm a small person) stacks of boxes and was handed a product and told it was $20, or I could buy the one that was opened, and the owner attempted to hand it to me. I declined (it looked very unsanitary and dirty, the mod was fully exposed with no box in sight). The staff knew nothing about the products, couldn't provide any details, and seemed to not be familiar with any of their own products. I made them aware I was going to look around elsewhere and hustled out, having to dance around another person just to exit the scary small business. Maybe if they relocate, spend some time organizing and looking professional, and train themselves to be experts in their field then I'd consider going back. Maybe.

What makes this food hall different from the others scattered around the metro area is the uniqueness of the Bottleworks development and the effort in preserving the historic details of the former largest coca cola bottling plant in the world.  The Garage is the name given to the food court and you will see the name garage all along Carrollton etched into the building on the west side of the street all the way from Mass Avenue, passed 9th, and up to the north end of the development.

We didn't realize that the south end of the development was NOT the food court and shops.  It is for a separate business.  The food court is strictly north of 9th Street.  There is limited street parking (metered) along Mass Avenue and a few spots along Carrollton, but most of the street is drop off zones only.  Fortunately, there are parking lots that require you to take a ticket when you enter.  The lots are on the west side of the building that contains the food court.  They aren't cheap by Indy standards, running about $5 for 3 hours, with prices for longer periods escalating from there.  The good news is that if you make purchases inside, you may get your parking validated or at least discounted.  I didn't use the lot, so I can't say how much it saves.  Note that you have to take your receipts to a validation station before you attempt to drive off.  Hopefully a future visit or review will make note of where the validation stations are located.  

Inside the Garage I found a bunch of food places with mutiple ethnic offerings as well as a burger place, so hopefully, everyone in you group will find something to satisfy their appetite.  

The interior of the garage does get a bit loud and my wife thought it a bit austere in appearance.  You get spoiled looking at all the cool detail on the outside of the building and at the hotel, but in here, it seems like any other large space.  Not bad, just not the wow that you see on the approach.  The garage has typical food court seating with mostly smaller tables for social distancing.  So, if you see one retaurant is packed with customers in line, there are usually some tables not too far of a walk down the way.

The place appeared well maintained and seemed like sanitation was in good order too.  Restrooms were unisex and located in the middle of the garage.  You have to keep you eyes open to find them since they don't have large flashing signs calling attention to them.  We found some near the ""Lick Ice Cream"" shop.

I would gladly return to check out some more of the shops and food places if offered the chance to go.

uKTygH4YmIup5DRyl72jJA,D6BU7ZjS1gYhhPGHSr3C9Q,1Vq7DR9FRh_ud2EMA3ldpw,1,8,0,0,"I would never recommend this apartment complex to anyone. Although the apartments are aesthetically appealing and seemingly come with wonderful amenities, I have found that what is advertised does not match the true experience of living here. As you can see below, the cons of living here significantly outweigh the pros.

Pros:
- Location, near the river and quick access to major highways
- Availability of assigned parking spots (but at a significant cost)
- Grocery store located in the common building (super friendly staff)
- The pool (when it is actually open) and outdoor spaces
- Newly renovated apartments, nice kitchens

Cons:
- The apartments are unable to simultaneously have both A/C and heat running. They switched the HVAC unit to heat early in the fall. There was a stretch of about a week where the weather was over 70 degrees. This left many resident's apartments, including my own, reaching temperatures over 85 degrees for an entire week. No explanation or apology was sent to residents. Those who reached out to management were simply told to ""open our windows"" and deal with it. The windows only open a few inches. I was unable to comfortably function or sleep in my own home. I cannot imagine working from home at this time.
- PTP canceled the commuter shuttle in the middle of a pandemic. This left many residents who are healthcare workers without a means to get to work. Management stated it is because there are not enough people using the shuttle for the cost of the shuttle. However, they have not offered any reimbursement on our rent.
- You can hear EVERYTHING through the walls and vents. I can hear chatter from multiple surrounding apartments through vents in my wall. I am not referring to muffled noises. I can make out entire conversations of multiple neighbors, including my neighbors upstairs who think it is appropriate to be having parties throughout the pandemic. I hear at least 3 different dogs barking throughout the day. It is difficult to sit in the apartment and do anything productive without having headphones in the entire time.
- Prior to many of these issues coming to light, I renewed my lease. Management attempted to significantly increase my monthly rent and parking (a $75 increase in monthly parking). This was during the height of the pandemic when 0 of their amenities they advertise were open. This was while they were simultaneously sending out emails attempting to show their ""concern"" for residents who were unable to pay their rent for the month.
- I have lost hot water multiple times for multiple days since moving here less than a year ago.
- Many people, including staff, do not wear masks around the buildings. Capacity limits are not enforced in common areas which means even though amenities are now open, those of us who want to safely use them cannot do so (I.e. fitness center).
- You are required to pay a $50 dollar fee each year for a locker service for packages. This package service became overwhelmed during the holidays to the point where all of the residents' packages were just put into a large room to sort through ourselves.
- No consolation or rent reimbursement has been offered throughout the last 10 months of amenities being intermittently closed. I know many individuals, including myself, moved to this complex for its amenities.",2021-01-13 04:35:19,636,3324,

We were told approx 30minutes for the green track and 45minutes for the red track. However, they said they don't take reservations on the phone so we would have to reserve it on line or vía walk in. This isn't an issue, no problem.  I asked her the difference between the red track and green track and if it was called ""red track"" and ""green track"" online, bc you have to reserve one or the other. She said ""oh, idk anything about our online system..I just know that it works"" hahaha wait what?

At 4:51 I reserved 3 races. It was $70 for three people to do ONE race!! OUCH! The earliest reservation was for 5:36pm...I thought the arbitrary time was bc it was so accurate. We reserved it and at 4:57 I got an email for our reservations. 

At 4:59 we got to the track. We were told we had to make a profile. Perfect, no problem! We made a profile and then checked in. We were told that we had about a 30 minute wait. Yup! No problem because that's what our reservations are.

5:36- our name was not called
6:00- our name was not called...at this point our 30minute wait tuned into an hour. 
6:30- our name was not called
TWO HOURS LATER I go to the front desk. 

I was told they made a mistake and kept putting people in front of us.  No apology- nothing. She said that it happens sometimes? Lol okay.
Infact, we watched a family ride THREE times before us AND a family who came in AFTER us rode before we did??

We didn't get on the track until 6:57pm...then they call you and everyone else and there's an orientation, etc then you get in the car and wait even longer. I bet we didn't start driving until 7:15..

We got there at 5pm - was told it was a 30 minute wait - then rode at 7:15.
We had a sad and patient and hungry teen with us. It could have been a great experience but it was very disappointing.",2021-01-04 01:22:52,422,1866,

I stopped by here over the weekend with my husband just to take a quick look at shops, progress, and food options. Before you can enter, there are a variety of lots to park in. The one that we found was $5 for the first 3 hours and incrementally more the longer you stayed. There was a 15 minute free parking spot right in front as well - likely a good option for those running in to grab something. My hope is that the parking cost does not deter potential patrons. The parking in the lot is a bit more expensive than metered street parking options nearby. 

Upon entry, you're welcomed into an industrial food and shopping hall. There is plenty of socially distant seating options and the day that we went, there was a dj playing music as well. Overall, it was crowded, likely since it just opened. Some of the spots remain open (waiting for a new business to come in), but there were already plenty of options. Some notable options: La Chinita Poblana (formally located in Broadripple, closed some time ago and offers amazing tacos), Lick (some of my favorite ice cream in Indy), Hard Truth Distillery (amazing drink options), Clancy's Hamburgers (their fries looked delicious), Poke Guru (not sure if they are still in City Market, but was one of my go-tos there), and many more. There are two retail stores in there as well - Pumkinfish and a men's outdoor store (Becker Supply). We saw a pottery/ceramic space as well. 

We stopped by Azucar Morena to try some delicious arepas. We each ordered the Reina and added some cheese. One arepa is a good portion for a breakfast/lunch - it's a palm sized 'sandwich' PACKED with ingredients. Each one was about $10 with additional toppings at $2/per topping. The arepa was made to order and took about 5-10 minutes. We asked for a green salsa with it after seeing others do so - it was delicious & garlicky. The arepa was delicious - definitely worth a try! They had some others options as well that may be worth trying next time. A side note, after eating a delicious meal, we were looking for beverage options. Most of the vendors appeared to sell bottled water for $2-$3/bottle. Something to keep in mind for your visit! 

Overall, we're excited to come back and try all of the amazing options. As we were on our way out, we saw a pizza by the slice spot that looks like it will make a great lunch in the near future!",2021-01-18 15:10:41,528,2490,

My experience with Yakitori Boy is that once you take away the wrappings and glitter/glam. The food really does have much to be desired. In terms of an izakaya-style eatery, Yakitori Boy is only okay.

+PARKING: Basically non-existent. Street parking only. Which is typical for the Chinatown area.

+INTERIOR: Great bar-like atmosphere to hang out with friends (pre-covid). The lighting is very ambient and the interior is dark and intimate. Great for small parties or even couples looking for a late-night dinner. But that's the appeal of Yakitori Boy I guess. Not many places in Chinatown have this lounge/pub-type of feel and a lot of younger people like to frequent Yakitori Boy.

+FOOD: The main attraction to Yakitori Boy is their variety of discounted happy hour skewers. The best ones I would say would be the CHICKEN skewers and BACON QUAIL EGG skewers. Skip on the ribeye skewers because the meat it too overcooked and tough. I would say stick to their fried foods and yakitori because the quality of sushi here is not worth it. I've tried both their Chef Roll (a crab, caviar [masago], avocado, and cucumber) and Volcano Roll (spicy tuna, caviar [masago], avocado). The rolls are miniscule and easily half the size of a standard 8-piece roll. I really don't think the sushi here is anything to write home about. I will say they have a huge menu with a wide-variety of offerings. So there's definitely something for everyone.

+PRICE: No way would I pay full price for Yakitori Boy's offerings. Their happy hour prices are a much better deal. Paying full price for their fare would be a rip-off. The skewers go for $1 on Tuesdays and their drinks are usually around $3-$6 during happy hour. 

Overall: Yakitori Boy is not the place to go if you're looking for good food. Good atmosphere to have a good time. But, I've experienced better food at other izakaya bars before. I think ordering to-go has helped me peel back the glamour of their atmosphere and see that their food is sub-par and ok at best. Can't comment on their karaoke.",2021-01-25 19:12:54,432,2120,
jb_Wbx9kcH0nrPM5VxPBQg,fegUHze8ihummWgTzQ2VYQ,OAWa1WML2V1ZLJGD6V3nBQ,4,10,6,9,"When we saw the Rupert Grint comment about Middle Child, it bumped it way up on our list! While we originally heard of the restaurant for their lunch sandwiches, we were also very intrigued by their breakfast options, so we wound up placing an order for brunch. The entire menu is pretty limited, which always tells me that what they do, they do well. That being said, the breakfast menu consists of just 2 sandwiches, making our decision very easy. These guys are only available on the weekends and only for a few short hours, so be sure to place your order before the time runs out! To order, you must download the Middle Child app, which is just a minor inconvenience for obtaining the food. We placed an order and received word that our food would be ready within 30 minutes, so a very quick turnaround! The shop is closed to customers, but we easily retrieved our order once we arrived. 
In terms of food, as mentioned, just 2 breakfast options - the breakfast sandwich and the Hershel sandwich - so I got the breakfast and my fiancee the Hershel, and we split. Since we had walked ~20 minutes home with the sandwiches, we expected them to be a bit soggy and less crisp as if we would have enjoyed while there. The sogginess honestly wasn't too bad, but my sandwich did lose its integrity a little bit. However, it certainly didn't compromise the taste! The OG sandwich features the most fluffy eggs I have ever had, a nice sharp cheddar, and some arugula, all in cased by potato bread. I haven't had potato bread since I was a child, so this was a nice throwback and matched well with the contents. The egg was SO good, so light and fluffy but also so substantial, and the cheese was perfectly melted as a great accompaniment. A basic, but very well done sandwich. The Hershel was definitely the star though - featuring rye bread as the base, it enclosed corned beef and that same fluffy egg, as well as the sharp cheddar. The beef stole the show and made for an unforgettable and unique sandwich. I definitely wish I also would have ordered this one! 
Overall, we really enjoyed our Middle Child breakfast experience. The eggs were the fluffiest we've had, and the flavors were very intentionally paired in both sandwiches. We can't wait to try again for lunch someday! Thanks Middle Child, and thanks Rupert Grint for re-sparking our interest!",2021-01-31 00:42:37,479,2351,

For our first visit, we had lunch from J's Lobster & Fish Market, and I had dessert from Lick Ice Cream. We both got a lobster roll with chips, drinks, and my boyfriend got a side of clam chowder for about $50. The lobster rolls were really tasty, good portions of meat, and all around a nice presentation. The chips left something to be desired as they were a mix of regular and some kind of spicier BBQ, but it seems like they might have just been poured out of a bag. We'd probably get fries next time instead. My boyfriend thought the clam chowder was great and again, had nice large chunks of meat. 

The Lick ice cream was just as incredible as I've heard about before! I got orange and milk chocolate, and I would definitely eat it again. The cone was warm and super fresh and smelled and tasted amazing. 

We were able to watch the Colts playoff game on a big screen while eating. It was slightly difficult to find a table on opening Saturday, and I did not see any staff cleaning tables between guests. (Maybe a self-serve cleaning option with wipes would be nice to add?) However we were able to easily access sanitizer, and we saw good mask compliance. We also shopped at Pumkinfish and Becker Supply Co, great little gift stores in the Garage. We'll definitely be back to try more of the food options soon. We parked in the adjacent lot for $3 for up to 3 hours which was reasonable and plenty of time. 

The only negative was that the music was REALLY loud (like, in a club loud) which wasn't great for visiting or listening to the Colts game, but that's only a minor issue.",2021-01-09 19:57:13,353,1659,
ZvXRyE5tKqHv-S-Ts9mlMw,gZTe6SgFxPDq5hq2fX6iSw,3v0tSwHXR9LhpsoGXLgsTA,3,5,0,1,"Disclaimer: I'm from New Orleans and used to a different type of seafood boil, so that's why the 3 stars. Doesn't mean it wasn't good, just wasn't entirely my cup of tea, but definitely check them out!!!

Drove past this place a bunch when we first moved here (it was closed due to delays with Covid & approvals & stuff), but once it re-opened it's been PACKED which was the reason why my husband and I tried it one night. We called in for pick-up (had to call a couple times because it kept dropping after certain number of rings? Not sure if they were busy or phones were acting up, but when we finally got through we ordered the fried catfish, fried oysters, and a build your own bag with mussels, crawfish, crab, shrimp, sausage, corn, potatoes, and eggs with Juicy special seasoning.

It was ready in about 10-15 minutes and despite being a packed lot of people waiting to pick-up, the process went really smoothly.

As you can see from the attached pic, I was a bit hesitant when I first opened the bag (sure the sauce settled) but the egg was bright white and clearly hadn't been boiled with the seafood. I think that was my biggest complaint with the whole thing, I'm used to New Orleans seafood boils where if we serve egg or potatoes or corn with the boil, we've boiled them in the pot with the seafood and the spices so it gets soaked into every inch and is full of flavor. This seemed more to be boiled on the side in salt water and then added into the bag with seafood that had also been boiled in not-spicy water and then tossed with sauce? I guess it just took me a bit to adjust to it, but I was a little sad inside. The sauce itself is delicious and I can see why people rave about it. You peel the seafood and dip it in this super buttery, salty sauce and it's great, but I do wish the seafood itself and the sides had been boiled in seasoning themselves so that at their base they were also flavorful? But that also might not work in a restaurant like this. Boiling everything the same way and then tossing it with different levels of spicy sauce might be more conducive to running a restaurant that offers different spice levels as opposed to New Orleans where what you get is what you get! 

The fried catfish was delicious, and the oysters were big and plump and crispy, the fried seafood baskets are a large portion for the price and the fries are great, kind of like those coated rally's fries! It was definitely a unique experience (we also don't serve our boils with butter or sauce or anything like that...we judge them by how well you season the water when you boil), but while very rich and greasy, the garlic and salt flavors were a great compliment to the boiled seafood so I can see why it's so popular! We will definitely be back to try it again and see if it grows on me, but the fried seafood is definitely a win in my book!",2021-01-04 08:16:55,609,2859,

Now that I am married, an item needs to pass both my criteria AND my  wife's, but even that wasn't a problem at Houseworks!  As we explored the showroom, we were greeted by the staff and offered help if we needed anything, otherwise, we were free to browse.  My wife was simply looking for a table lamp (which she found) and also a floor lamp.  She had in mind what she wanted and while she worked with the salesman to find it, I browsed what seemed like an art museum of wonderful furniture and fixtures and decor.  

If I wanted to have the coolest den or man cave, there were tables that used gears for expanding or drop leaves that could save room.  Artistic pieces adorned the walls and side tables too.  My wife tried some of the chairs around the multiple tables set up for dining rooms and if she may start prompting me to go along with getting some.  She liked that they were more than simply functional for eating, but that they could easily adapt to becoming more relaxing allowing the person seated there to lean back.

Honestly, if all shopping was this much fun, I would go more often!  Now understand these aren't mass produced (ie poor quality) pieces.  But if you are shopping for furniture on the north side of town, I assume you already know that it can get expensive.  As long as the quality is there, I don't mind.  

I have a feeling that some more shopping is in our near future.  I have a feeling that Houseworks  will be seeing us again soon!

The facility:
This restaurant is located in a strip mall, but don't let that detract you.  Entering the facility was a quant restaurant with tables spread out to promote social distancing.  The first thing I noticed was their pizza oven.  It was a piece of art.

The service:
We were greeted right away my the waiter. He was very knowledgeable about the different dishes and gave excellent explanation of the specials. The water was always refilled... I was thirsty so that was three times. The wine recommendation was great too.

The Food:
Since we haven't been here before, we wanted to grab a selection of the food options.  We started off with the Mista salad.  It was good, but could have had a little more flavor in the dressing.  The salad was light and refreshing.  Next week had the Margarita Pizza.  Since they make their own dough and sauce we had to try it.  This was very flavorful. We really enjoyed it.  Next, I had the Lobster Special and my wife had the Lasagna. Both dishes had homemade pasta which really makes the difference.  No shortcuts here.  The Lobster special, I can't say enough about.  There were so many complementing flavors, rich, and delicious.  The Lasagna was very good too.  The sauce had delicious flavors and the pasta had good flavor.

Last thoughts:
The price is on the higher side, but given the ingredients and prep, it's justified. We will be back and to try other items on the menu.  Looking forward to our next visit.

Thank you!",2021-01-12 04:32:34,326,1575,

Overall, the flavors are there, mild, but I didn't taste the authenticity of Thai spices/flavors. Maybe because I ordered everything mild spicy, which apparently means non-spicy at this restaurant. All lunch dishes were scarce of meat; not sure if this would be better had we ordered dinner plates... would assume same ratio? 

-Crying Tiger (mild spicy): beef slices served with romaine lettuce (yay for change from cabbage) and lemon grass lime & green onion sauce. I understand the beef is normally chewy but would be so much better if it's cut against the grains. Few pieces for the price. Sauce is a must to accompany this dish, but I'm a bit disappointed that it's not spicy at all and lacking several spices and the beef didn't taste like it was marinated. 
-Pad see ew: sauce was pretty much just light soy sauce instead of a dark soy based mixture. Still taste good but missing a bit of complexity
- Thai Kitchen noodles: saucy wide noodles with imitation crab, ground chicken and shrimp. Good value and taste. For a ""mild sauce"" it's more flavorful than the Pad see ew. 
-BBQ pork fried rice: probably the best flavor dish of these four, but again lack of meat. We get a piece every other Tbsp of rice. Maybe I'm spoiled by other restaurants lol. 

Lastly, I'd give this restaurant another try and order a more spicy crying tiger, try other dishes & eating in door to update on services.",2021-01-29 16:18:53,309,1494,

The ordering process was very easy and directions were very clear but the pick up was disappointing - I selected a 7pm pick up time and our food was not available until ~8:30pm... I was HANGRY by the time we got our food.

When we arrived home, the food was lukewarm so we had to reheat it BUT everything tasted amazing! I ordered a short rib platter, which came with sweet potato purée and a mix of collards and cabbage; my hubby ordered the fried chicken platter, served with potatoes and the collard and cabbage mix also. Both platters were also served with appetizer samplers and dessert samplers - yum, yum, yum... The appetizer platter contained a Caesar salad topped with lump crab meat (no shell residue), 2 halves of jerk chicken rolls, 2 scallops wrapped in bacon and a deviled egg topped with shrimp... Again, deeeelicious!!! In addition to this, there was also a black eyed pea stew added as well as a side of cornbread. All accompaniments were just what I needed (but didn't know - lol). I could not finish my food in one sitting because it was so much but I will be eating my leftovers - lol.

I would highly recommend getting take out from Relish or dining in (when possible); the food is great and prepared to perfection and the prices aren't bad. I've dined here a few times pre-COVID with small groups and the ambiance of the restaurant is lively and the music is on point along with the food.

Final note to management - please prepare better in the future. It was a big let down to show up at my reserved pick up time to learn that my order was not ready (until 90 mins later)... If people show up to support your establishment and pay their hard earned money for a decent meal, you and your associates should be giving your best also...

Nothing is too heavy on spices but just enough so that the flavor really takes you on a ride. Everything is served on injera, an Ethiopian crepe. 

Honey Wine- a sweet and tart alternative to traditional red wine! Made in house and very tasty! 4/5

Homemade Ice Tea- a fresh and tasty tea that most people would compare to ""chai"" tea in Starbucks. The spices are warm and have cinnamon, cloves and cardamom in it. If you don't like cloves then you may not like this drink. 5/5

Sambusa (Vegetable, chicken or beef)- an amazing appetizer that is a must have when coming here. If you need a comparison to what it tastes like, samosas are close. The beef one is minced beef with fresh Spices. The vegetable ones are filled with lentils and the chicken ones are filled with shredded chicken and spices. 5/5

Ye-Dora Watt (dark bone in chicken)- absolutely wonderful in flavour and a beautiful color. In a nice brown curry/gravy. Not too salty. 5/5

Ye-Doro Tibbs (yellow boneless chicken)- very nice light chicken with good light tangy spices. 4.5/5

Chefs Tibbs (light brown lamb)- if you like lamb, this is an amazing and flavourful dish! Even if you don't like lamb, try it because you might be surprised at how it isn't Gamey or too strong in the lamb flavour. Watch out though, because there is jalapeño and habanero pieces in it. The habanero gives quite a kick. 5/5

Kay Watt (beef stew)- delicious and very reminiscent of a South Indian beef curry. 5/5

Kay Watt Fit-Fit- literally the Kay Watt that's been pan fried a little longer and mixed with more spices and herbs and then mixed with injera. 5/5

Kitfo- a raw steak Tartare mixed with nice spices. The texture may not be for all but it's a very unique dish that is high on quantity and quality. 4/5

Injera- this is a brown, tangy crepe made out of teff, a unique grain to Ethiopia. You eat all the curries/vegetable dishes with it as an accompaniment, like bread. It's so soft. 5/5

Vegetables:
Collard greens- my favourite side vegetable of all of them! Tangy and with a nice chew 5/5

Cabbage- delicious and yellow with soft texture. 4/5

Brown lentils- very delicious with a slight chew. 4/5

Beets- a nice cold vegetable with a few spices added to it.

Tiramisu (not pictured)- Only thing that I find not good on their menu is their tiramisu. It's probably the only item in the restaurant which I would recommend to avoid.  I think it would be interesting to have an Ethiopian dessert there instead. 1/5",2021-01-08 05:01:50,532,2579,
yrjlU2a4op2O3XOQIPcdPA,VTUxik1f0cSRGBsUa2rb-Q,Eqfks4GEn5dsI4ZGiPrCVQ,2,4,0,0,"I took my husband here for his birthday dinner.  He is a fan of Italian and since it was his birthday I wanted to pick a fancier venue. The problem, we paid fancy venue prices but did not receive fancy venue quality food. We ordered starter salads and a pasta to share and entrees. Other tables were enjoying some complimentary bread while we sat and waited. And waited. And waited some more. Our drinks finally came out. I had ordered some hot tea and the glass they gave me was visibly dirty. It took about ten minutes to get a new one because our waitress was very inattentive. I didn't know if it was an out of sight out of mind thing (we were on the patio), but for the amount of money you spend there I expected more. When she did finally return she brought our salads out at the same time as our pasta dish. She blamed the kitchen for reading the ticket wrong on the order of the meal. Since it was cold out we had the choice of eating our salads first while the pasta turned cold or eating pasta before salad.  We didn't have the option to send the pasta back until we were ready for it because as soon as she dropped the plates she was already headed back inside.  The salads were average at best and halfway through eating them a busboy was sent out to ask if we'd like fresh cracked pepper. A little late for that. The manicotti we ordered for our pasta dish was subpar. The tomato sauce was watery and lacked flavor. We had ordered kind salmon with rock shrimp and beef tenderloin for our entrees. My husbands beef tenderloin came with a delicious Demi glacé and garlic potato purée. The meat was cooked to perfection and had depths of flavor. My salmon was flavorless. It was supposed to come with a lemon butter sauce and served over sautéed spinach. The sauce had no flavor except for butter. The complimentary bread comes with a pesto dipping sauce. I had to use that to make the salmon semi enjoyable. The spinach was just sautéed, once again lacking any flavor. We got our dessert to go since we waited so long for the option to even order any.  I don't think we will be back. For the price you pay you expect top notch service and food. We received neither. 

Side note:  It's been hard to eat out with the recent surge of COVID cases in Arizona so we opted to eat outside on the patio. We were told ahead of time that they do not have heaters outside. Just wanted to let people know in case they choose this option. The one bad thing about eating outside is we were forgotten, the whole meal. But I am glad we ate outside because watching from outside they packed them in inside. I am a healthcare professional and I do not feel like there was sufficient enough space between diners to be safe.",2021-01-09 16:19:30,561,2714,

I've had some of the so-called best in Philly, and though Cosmi's doesn't often get the love that others do, I found their cheesesteak to be right up there with the best in town.  Absolutely loved the chewy sesame seed bread, which, as every true cheesesteak lover knows, is 75% of what makes for a great cheesesteak!!!  I also thought Cosmi's did a better job than most of the others seasoning the steak, an important step, that many of the top-rated joints skip.  This is especially important if you prefer your sandwich with provolone, which isn't nearly as salty as whiz or American.  Lastly, Cosmi's is, in my opinion, the only cheesesteak joint among the best of the best that gets the onions right--no huge unflavored petals, but slivered onions that are perfectly caramelized, without going overboard, and which are, again, lightly seasoned.  All of this greatness, plus, even though the store was actually closed, Mike (co-owner) came into the store early to make my sandwiches, which I had ordered the day before not knowing that the store would be closed.  When he learned that I was a huge Philly cheesesteak fan, who'd driven some distance for the food, he threw in extra whiz, a small container of those perfectly grilled onions, and a 2-liter soda free of charge.  As far as I'm concerned, Cosmi's is hard to beat, more flavor and better bread than anywhere else I've gone in Philly!!!  Do yourself a favor and give them a try...might change your life.",2021-01-03 17:44:22,345,1636,

PARKING -- your guest will have to fend for themselves and search for parking. They currently have a dirt lot that isn't technically theirs and is being turned into different very soon. There is street parking, but after a certain time it's only for residents. There is a parking garage nearby Skyhouse but it is one of the most expensive parking garages you'll come across. The best garage is at the Grand Central with two free hours. 

So if you're a person that doesn't have a lot of company then this is fine. 

DOG PARK -- oh the smell of that dog park can overwhelm you on some days. Really puts a damper on a nice stroll up the sidewalk. I will say though that I have personally seen it being cleaned and it doesn't always carry a strong smell, BUT when it does whew! There are so many dog owners in the area though that it's understood that the park might have a smell. 

Literally everything else about this location is to be praised. The units are spacious. The pool isn't too deep. The residents are so very friendly. The elevators are quick. The balcony's are huge. The hallways are nice. The foyers are nice. The staff is nice. The fridges have ice makers. Some units have built in wine coolers! WINE COOLERS! There is a neighborhood grocery store below. District tavern across the street. Walking distance from Sparkman. Publix around the corner. 

I mean it just a great piece of property. I visit as a guest often so the parking just hits me a little different LOL -- but this is definitely my favorite set of affordable condos on Channelside",2021-01-05 17:06:47,351,1695,

I went during the week mid-afternoon and five cars were waiting behind one double parked car blocking the narrow street. I wound up using the tiny metered lot across from HMart.

This is a hybrid store, as many reviews note. Upstairs you can find a small food court, a bank, and cookware. Take the escalator. On prior trips, I bought fresh buns, dumplings and Chinese food.

Downstairs is the main store. If you go early enough, you'll find store made maki and other dishes, near the produce section.

Frozen:
A decent variety of frozen dumplings, not as big a selection as in NJ, but good considering the store size. I found my favorite Kimchi dumplings on sale plus some octopus dumplings, and beef and veggie dumplings. 

Turkey Hill ice cream and mochi, too!

Sauces:
I had some chili paste at home but got extra sauce. They have lots of Lao Gan Ma (old godmother) sauce. Which is insanely spicy and why I use Mangda chili paste or the two others I just bought. If you're looking for Huy Fong Sriracha, get it here instead of a non-Asian supermarket. It's typically cheaper. 

Refrigerated foods: They didn't have turnip cake, which I'll have to ask for, but do have a large Hispanic refrigerated food section including chorizo and cotija cheese. Lots of tofu near the produce section. 

Parking: Hit or miss, see the circus described above. 

Public Transportation: SEPTA 101/102 trolleys stop nearby one stop before 69th Street Terminal. An easy walk. 

Covid-19 precautions: Masks required for entry. It's a byzantine layout so I don't think social distancing is realistic. The store does make an effort once you get to checkout. That was relatively quick.",2021-01-01 16:04:25,356,1738,

In August 2019, my boyfriend and I had one of the most amazing meals/experiences of our lives at Hiroki. From start to finish, it was 5 stars all the way. I recently graduated from nursing school and passed my RN exam (yay!), so Hiroki was my celebratory evening of choice as we had such an unbelievable experience the first time around.

I realize times are different right now and restaurants are doing their best to maintain a high quality (and high-end in Hiroki's case) experience for guests, so I'm understanding of some of the changes. The outdoor, heated, private greenhouses are SO cool and provide a very intimate outdoor dining experience that isn't nearly as awesome as sitting at the chef's counter, but serves its' purpose. The service was stellar and our server was very friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. Now, the first thing that really set us off was the fact that they are only offering bottle service right now. That's right, no individual drinks or even half bottle options. Both of us are liquor/sake drinkers, so we were forced to purchase an entire bottle between the two of us, half of which we didn't even drink and just took home. But, it was also an extra $100 added to our check (plus tax and tip) that we did not anticipate on an already pricey bill. There has to be a better way to serve guests aside from forcing them to purchase an entire bottle of their drink of choice. Second, the portion sizes were just not the same. Last year I walked out of Hiroki STUFFED after eating what had to be at least 20 pieces of sushi/sashimi/nigiri on top of other appetizers, soup, and dessert. This time, I walked out ready to grab a cheesesteak in South Philly.

The quality of food cannot be beat and the service/atmosphere was delightful, but for $540/2 people (yes, more than half a grand), I expect more and I expect to leave full, at the very least. Disappointed in Hiroki this time around and probably won't be back for a while. I understand the new precautions, but there has to be a better approach.",2021-01-25 19:22:34,455,2188,

I'll start off with saying the food is not great- tastes like ""bar food"" (chicken tenders were average)- but as long as you know you're not coming here for that, you'll be fine. The servers try not to interrupt you during the show too much, but they were quick to come to our table when they saw empty drinks. No complaints on the service at all.

Most nights a show is held at 6 pm and 8:30 pm- usually between 2-4 singers/songwriters show up, and play their own songs. It's very personal, they tell you a little bit about their life and about what inspired them to write each song. I loved learning about each of them and felt really connected. After the show, they hang around to talk and take pictures with you as well. 

I wasn't sure how I would feel listening to all original songs (I LOVE listening to covers at all the country bars here in Nashville- but all 4 artists sang 5 songs each, and I LOVED every single song. I am blown away at the undiscovered talent here in Nashville and this experience truly was amazing. Lily Rose was my absolute favorite- but the others were just as spectacular (Eric Van Houten, Ashley Cooke, and Gable Bradley). I can see all of them being on the radio- their lyrics and their voices were beautiful.

Seating is first come first serve, so best to show up 30 minutes before the show. Valet is attached to the building and only $3- however, realize that the entire building valets and it does take a few minutes after the concert to get your car. Tickets are around $5/person, and there is a $15/person minimum once there. 10/10 experience- cannot wait to go back!!",2021-01-19 17:23:57,380,1806,

First time out to eat with the wife during the pandemic. She is very skeptical and concerned about sanitizing, cleaning, crowds etc.
So on that note, the restaurant was very clean, although there were a few crumbs on our chair, it could make you wonder if it was truly cleaned and sanitized, but perhaps the chair was cleaned before the table top.
We were sat in the ""upper area"" right before you go out to the patio. We were for the moment the only table sat in the area, but soon another single top was sat behind us and then a two top as well. I would say they weren't 6t feet apart, more like 4 - 5 feet. For my wife's comfort we were able to move the table back about a foot. As were were ending our meal a 4 top was going to be sat on the side of us, again, less than 6 ft. In regard to covid-19, table distance was our only complaint.
Our server was very good and attentive.  
For the food, we each had wings and PJ Fries. They were accommodating with the request of having the old bay spice on the side.
The wings had good flavor and were much larger than previous dining experiences. My only complaint would be they were a little dry, not from cooking but from not enough sauce for my preference. Also, I had the original hot sauce which could be hotter, was more on the mild side.
The celery was crisp and fresh. The fries were also crisp and hot.
Overall, this is one of the better meals I had at a Pjs in a while. Hopefully not a fluke and it continues.",2021-01-07 00:29:15,328,1483,

It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon, and I heard about this little place up in Virginia city that had the best Mexican food. We made the trek up the big hill and I am so happy we did this little restaurant is fantastic!! 

First we were greeted at the door by a very friendly waitress, we had a corner table where we had perfect views of the very old building! The place was extremely neat and clean. To me that's the first sign that it's going to be an awesome meal!

We started off with some fresh salsa and chips which we washed down with some Bloody Mary's and a few beers. I was embarrassed to admit that I really wanted to try the fried chicken, even though we were in a Mexican restaurant. We asked our waitress what she recommends and I was so happy when she said they were famous for the fried chicken!! So of course, I ordered it and I am glad I did because it was fantastic. So crunchy, moist and full of flavor served over some mashed potatoes with gravy and corn right off the cob!! My folks and sister also licked their plates!! Every was so fresh and you can tell it was made to order! 

The place was filling up pretty quickly, so I would maybe call ahead because of the Covid restrictions.

That being said, I'm here to review something else; if you visit The Manhattan Deli and don't get a slice of NY Style Cheesecake, I'll assume this is a cry for help. Blink twice if you are being watched by a Secret Agent. Blink three times if the fate of the Free World depends on you not ordering the cheesecake. 

RE: What God made after he rested on the 7th Day, The Crust...oh goodness the crust. I am someone who knows that a cheesecake is nothing without a wonderful crust--this one happens to be equal parts fantastic and fabulous. It's thick (thicc, you already know), buttery, crumbly, and not the slightest bit soggy. 

The filling is velvety and smooth. It is the perfect consistency throughout. There isn't a single lump, crack, or dry spot. It is rumored that, when Leonardo DaVinci painted ""Lady with an Ermin,"" he used The Manhattan Deli MY Style Cheesecake as the inspiration for the her smooth, white, flawless skin. After the painting was complete; DaVinci, The Lady, and The Ermin each had a slice of the Cheesecake. 

Please, get a slice if you haven't yet. Pair it with a cup of coffee, not to drink, just to splash in your own face once you've gone into a Delicious Delirium. This will pass after a few minutes. Order a second slice to go.",2021-01-24 08:04:04,303,1380,

The staff here go out of their way to make you feel so comfortable and welcome. With the complimentary wine or champagne at checkin, the concierge provided us with all the information on this hotel and EXACTLY where our room was. Our room...... no complaints. It is tastefully decorated, I mean every little detail was carefully thought out. For example, the bedside tables have lamps. Those lamps are plugged into a socket like a lamp would but what's very thoughtful is that there is another socket set above where your table is. For charging your phones, maybe plugging in a heating pad (I sleep with one). I've never seen this done and thought it was great, made me smile. The artwork in the room is eclectic and satisfying. I loved the bed, it was so comfortable. The shower!!!! It's to die for. Rainfall shower heads - yes I mean more than one. Fully stocked snacks and mini bar.

I have been eager to enjoy an experience at the Restorative since hearing rave reviews from a friend. The food is always so beautiful & man, the flavor really matched its instagram potential! We started with the quail & asparagus as well as the naan with harissa. I honestly really loved the garlic butter it came with, even more then the harissa. My husband had the quail and was very enthusiastic about his enjoyment of this dish. The asparagus with prosciutto had water crest on it and wow, that flavor combination worked so well. For our main course, we had the beef tenderloin and bucatini. Both were very enjoyable. The bucatini was perfectly Al dente. The mushrooms served along side my beef tenderloin were such a variety and matched so well with the dish! 
Then came dessert! Both of the dishes we had were so amazing, we actually considered ordering the third dessert option as well just to experience it! But, ultimately by this point, we were way too full. 

The interior design is very clean and modern with a home feel. They have art work on the wall all of which is available for sale, should you be in the market. 

The service was spectacular!!! They were kind and fast!! With only 3 people working, I was floored at how quickly each meal was prepared and served. I was also incredibly impressed at how strict each team member was about informing patrons about the mask policy & really following through.

She reached out and told me to come in later for my appointment, then ran an hour over when she told me to come in. I came in with hair healthy enough to stand a color correction, I had a consultation with 4 other stylists & loved Melissa's energy so I booked with her. Lightener was left on my ends for 30 minutes, applied incorrectly and not close enough to my outgrowth, while she walked away to get her lunch & eat. You don't leave lightener unattended like that. Then came back and applied lightener to my regrowth & the dark, precolored spots it should have originally been applied to and let that process for an additional 30 minutes. When she finally rinsed me out, she was calm & cool until walking away & coming back freaking out about how my hair was breaking & that this was my fault bc of previous colors, insisting that I cut 4-5 inches off of my hair. I told her to tone me & stop service bc i no longer trusted her with my hair, in which she continued applying different products before finally toning my hair. I spent 35 minutes crying at the shampoo bowl bc a stylist I put faith in failed, as a stylist the integrity of hair is most important and at no point did she offer other options during the lightening stages. I was open to options if I could not reach my end goal, but she instead chose to ignore the integrity of my hair for an end goal, thanks for the hot roots. The whole experience was awful and unprofessional, leading back to her rinsing a test strand out of my hair by having me crouch next to the shampoo sink with a towel over my face & getting my face all wet. I should have stopped service when I originally was concerned, but I figured there was a reason she was doing things the way she was, although no other stylist I know & was speaking with during my service condoned any of the things she was doing. I now have ridiculous amounts of breakage that have to be cut, and a chemical burn from lightener on my scalp. The store manager said that they cannot do anything for me unless I come in during certain times, I do not live local nor am I waiting to have my hair cut to fix the damage or see a doctor about the chemical burns.

I was so amazed at their lack of professionalism I was going to have our corporate lawyer write a letter just because they need to learn a lesson.  But, then realized it's just $25 and I had let a little kid who doesn't care get me fired up.

I took it in for service twice, then I figured it out on my own what the problem was there was some kind of short in the wires every time I turned on the defrost because the radio to be fuzzy. The time when I took it in knowing what the issue was the repair man knew exactly that was what the problem was why didn't they fix it the first two times I was there. 
Your motto is if we can't duplicate it, We don't need to look into it or fix it even if you showed him a video. Three months after owning the car I had mold black mold in my air conditioner. The man that I dropped the car off to, agreed with my assessment. My son and I've been sick for several weeks and it all fell into place for a black mold. They cleaned it all out and added a charcoal filter that I should've been totally grateful that they gave it to me for free. I traded in my old car because my actuators on my doors wouldn't lock or unlock some times where I couldn't shut the door. That car was only six years old. But I traded it in for a brand new Toyota and within six months I was come out to my car door and it would be unlocked. Sometimes I would store things in my car that were valuable or sensitive materials. They were unable to duplicate the problem even with a video they were unable to fix the issue. My  water leaked into my trunk for over a year they couldn't duplicate the problem. But they were willing as soon as the extended warranty ran out to look at the problem for $800 advanced payment. I figured out it was the sunroof I never did get it fixed I traded in my car for Mazda. There was multiple other problems that they I just had a live with. The car ran fine and I was even getting good gas mileage when I traded it in. But there was all those other issues that just made it very unpleasant. The manager of the repair center was on the board of Toyota he would have his people talk to me so unpleasant. Be fine when I drop the car off when I picked it up they would talk nasty to me, as if instructed. If I would've kept every receipt and documented every dot and tittle, I could've and would've invoked the lemon law. That experience was left has left me with such an awful taste in mouth I'll never ever buy a Toyota again. And of course I'm gonna make sure of what he knows about that horrible dealership. I think my car was involved in flooding not from that dealership but another one only moved it over there to sell. I did not Get a good deal either. But they made their money off of me. I'm sure they're proud!",2021-01-22 03:54:38,602,2754,

I approached the podium with my full party, all Black women, ready to be seated. The hostess and 2 other employees stood around the podium attending to their reservation system screen. I waited patiently for them to look up from the screen and acknowledge me. Instead, a minute or two later The hostess left the podium and went to another party, all white, also waiting, in the distance to either acknowledge them or reassure them that their table would be ready shortly. She then reapproached the podium that I was standing directly in front of. I thought she surely she would ask me for my name or acknowledge my presence in some way. However, I continued to wait. Another minute or two, never looking up she proceeded to step away from the podium, again. I interrupted her saying ""Are you going to acknowledge that I am standing here?"" She stopped on her heels turned, hesitated and then stuttered that she would be ""right with me"". It was clear she thought that party of all Black women couldn't have possibly had a reservation for this establishment. There were no other Black patrons or Black staff that I could observe at this time. Another staff person asked if I had been helped I let her know I had not been helped and that I had actually been ignored. Unfortunately, after this incident I sadly loss my appetite. Having to assert your presence as a human being has some effects including losing your desire to eat. Sadly, we left to find somewhere else to celebrate my mother's birthday. It was a less than desirable experience that I wouldn't wish on anyone. Unfortunately I did not taste the food to make any recommendations to future patrons. However I hope my experience, as a Black woman, informs your choice to dine here.",2021-01-18 18:06:31,362,1806,

The first thing that bugged me was that you could make reservations 24 hours out, but not in the same day, or be on a waitlist. So we took a gamble and went. The second thing (more due to Covid; although I've been to plenty of places that do allow bigger parties), was that two of our friends ended up going elsewhere bc we wouldn't be able to sit together. It was going to be 6 adults, 1 baby, and 1 toddler. Apparently the kids counted in the 6 ppl max. So they lost money there.

The last thing that bugged me was that this is not a cheap dinner night out. I do not mind spending more on good food, but we were promised that as soon as they lay the protein on the table, we could order more (max is 4 items). I respect and understand the max part... but they laid the items down and quickly ran from the table. I totally get they were busy. Our server was running around constantly. But still... if we are paying $40 for all you can eat with a 2 hour max, we don't want to be sitting and waiting for more food to come. We did this a lot. And we are all huge meat eaters. 

All that being said, I would still recommend this place. I'm sure they are working out any kinks they have and everyone there was really nice and professional. 

But I probably won't be back anytime soon. Mostly bc at $100 for 2 adults and a small kid is a lot of money for a few pieces of meat and sides.",2021-01-06 13:28:53,367,1603,

I'm sorry I'm horrible with names) both introduced themselves and I got to hear about his journey to perfect his chicken. So cool. I don't know why I'm writing this cause it's gonna get busy and then I'll have to call ahead for pickup. So I'm here for work and finally on the 4th day the craving for Nashville hot chicken hit me. I did not feel like standing in line at Hattie B's, sorry to cheat on you lady. 

First off I read on Yelp about the coleslaw having apples in it and was like eh, I'm not ordering that cause I'm not a huge fan of apples. GD found out it was my first time there and he brought me out a spoonful and it was amazing. I want it piled on some waffle fries dusted w his spice blend over hot chicken nuggets with blue cheese crumbles and green onion. Like poutine or disco fries.  (Menu hint my friend-can name them Stump's fries!)

So I ordered, and forgive me here cause I wanted to try everything, a hot chicken kabob and a hot chicken breast quarter. Side of greens and okra. The kabob came out first and let me tell you what.  I put it in my mouth hole and it was delightful. Flavorful. Spicy. But flavorful.  The heat wasn't obtrusive. Alternating fried pickles and chicken chunks. GD is a madman! I slide the stick out and ate it on the slice of bread like we did w hotdogs as a kid, except this was legit tasty. I could have used some blue cheese dressing to really set this off. Maybe they had it and I didn't ask, I dunno. 

Few mins after I finished that, my quarter and sides came out. The okra. Okramazing! Like fried pickles but better. Raise your hand if you love fried okra. Use that hand to hail a cab to GD HOT CHICKEN AND TRY THE OKRA. Only thing I could see adding to it would be maybe some ranch, spicy ranch, blue cheese, berry sauce. Would really slay but I digress. 

Next was a bite of the greens. The chunks of pork pieces and fat had me like that looks good, real good. It was, again, amazing, literally the best greens I've ever had, anywhere. 

The chicken I already knew was gonna be good after the kabob. I plucked the wing off first, then tore open the breast. Juicy. Hot. Steamy. The crunchy exterior dusted w GD spice blend and that hot oil finish.  Blue cheese dressing please!!! I'm sorry I'm a wing guy from way back, worked at Hooters, blue cheese for life! 

I had to stop after just a few bites before I was gonna be miserable full. Luckily the coke was cold enough from the cooler when I opened it, it turned itself into a slushy. 

They got me a to go box and I'm picking on the leftovers in my hotel room as I write this. 

Outstanding. Don't go here you won't like it. 

Just so happy that we can all support these small mom and pop shops, when your big, famous and need a pilot, look me up, I'll almost work for your hot chicken!",2021-01-07 03:42:06,661,2885,

It looks clean,  presentable,  staff even pretends to be nice and care. But in reality,  they are doing shady things in this establishment. Staff who tested positive for covid didn't contact patrons until 2 weeks later via email and lied how many cases they really had.  I know,  I knew people who confirmed they were positive that worked there.  They also only sent the email to SELECTIVE people who voiced concern instead of everyone who came into the establishment those days. I know because I went to Zumba class and asked all the regular students,  and no one received it but me. This place isn't even doing the basic sanatizing they state they are doing either.  15min between group class is meant for sanatizing, teachers like the zumba teacher Kirsten do not take the time to use the fogger in between classes unless asked by one of the students. You never see anyone sanatizing equipment being used regularly, not staff or members. Beyond the basic things, the main zumba teacher lacks variety,  and does not do well with constructive direct suggestions, let alone constructive criticism from loyal zumba students. Same play list on Monday and Saturday classes, and some the dance on Wednesday nights as well for months on end. I also felt very uncomfortable that this zumba teacher would openly verbalize and ocularly leer at men at the water fountain during workout routines because they were all either married or involved. Further, they charge an annual fee that isn't unreasonable,  but during this covid recess, this gym decided to charge it without notifying members.  The only reason I'm ok with even the 1 star is the poor new manager, he's pretty down to earth,  and was able to refund my annual fee and monthly membership charges for a few months, when I voiced my dissatisfaction of all the above mentioned and more things the gym and staff were falling short of. 

Overall, save your money and time,  these people do nothing to safe guard your health.  The owner when approached about these matters and trouble with his staff talks a good talk but also falls short of delivering the superb customer service you would expect from a membership driven income.",2021-01-15 21:59:15,429,2264,

However, there's certainly something special going on here in the neighborhood known as Chatham Arch. Located along the end of Mass Avenue, this Bottleworks District is creating a breathtaking destination for locals and a tourist destination for downtown visitors all in one while also adding new purpose to the Art Deco landmarks that have long dotted the landscape in this area. 

It would have been easy, and perhaps even tempting, to simply remove these buildings that were nostalgic yet long vacant but instead we end up with functional buildings that celebrate the city's history. 

It's important to note, first of all, that this area is still in development. Key pieces have opened - the Bottleworks Hotel, The Garage Food Hall, the Living Room Theatres, and a couple of shops but other soon to be businesses are still under construction and it appears additional buildings and potential parking are altering the landscape without destroying the vibe (I'm looking at you, Broad Ripple). 

The Garage Food Hall is just that - it's a food hall. It's a destination food hall with 14 different vendors and I believe more to come. The food selection is diverse and ranges from modestly priced options like Clancy's Hamburgers to finer options like J's Lobster Shack. There are retailers, as well, including Pumkinfish that relocated from its previous spot on Mass Avenue. There are also some services, such as a barber shop. The vibe is industrial. You may be thinking about a mall food court, but this is cooler, more communal, and an awful lot more fun. In recognition of the pandemic still going on, it's also open concept with tables 6' apart and employees who are cleaning the heck out of the place. The doorways are traditional doorways (not automatic), but easily 95% of this place has been made accessible for mobility. By the time they get done, you'll have 30,000 square feet of food hall glory.

The Bottleworks Hotel is another Geronimo Hospitality Group joint (think Ironworks). Geronimo thrives in the industrial vibe and they've taken retro chic and industrial and made this one incredible place. 139 keys, that's rooms in hotel lingo, with a restaurant and lounge that I believe is soon to open. The hotel occupies the top two floors of what used to be the Coca-Cola plant's administration building. They've kept the vibe with some glorious updates including a staircase you've simply got to see. Geronimo does accessibility right - I haven't stayed here yet, but I've stayed at Ironworks and I was ready to move in with my wheelchair and all. 

The Living Room Theatres is an eight-screen joint that screams classic Hollywood. There's another staircase here you've simply got to see. This was started by actual filmmakers who know what makes watching a film special and they've added it here. Technically, Living Room is a ""chain"" if you consider having 3 locations a chain. They jumped in early and found the perfect location. I've already been here once and it's glorious. 

The retail spaces will eventually include 143,000+ square feet of retail space with each space ranging from 1,000 to 22,000 square feet. From what's present, you're getting an Indy vibe with some easy recognition that this will be a destination spot. 

Finally, there's even going to be office space here - 175,000+ square feet of people calling this space their Monday-Friday home (at least post-pandemic). I don't believe this space is open at all yet and there's obvious construction going on. By opening in phases, each destination gets perfected. 

There's paid parking to be found. All of Mass Avenue is meters anyway, so this is consistent with the area and it's actually MUCH more convenient. 

I'm not always big on these kinds of destination spots, but having already been down to Clancy's and Lick Ice Cream and Living Room (plus stopping in to see the hotel), I'm a fan and already anxious to return. 

While some concerns are legit, after all Chatham Arch has always been a fairly quiet residential area, so far everything looks quite promising and should help lift Indy's prospects in a post-pandemic world.",2021-01-30 11:20:38,822,4217,

Dr. Davenport practices in a manner that is money first and a patient second. I scheduled an appointment with Dr. Davenport's office for a Zoom Whitening treatment. I completed all of the necessary medical and pre-screening paperwork. The form was a pretty standard medical history form. As a responsible adult, I marked yes to the area asking if I was Epileptic. After reviewing my medical history they decided to proceed. I was delighted.  We went through the process of making the trays for the preceding fluoride treatment. At this time, Dr. Davenport requires 50% of the total treatment to be paid.  I paid and was told to return the following day to pick up my trays.  
This afternoon, I received a phone call.  I was told that they would be canceling their services with me due to my Epilepsy. I attempted to explain my seizure disorder to no avail.  I offered to supply a letter from my neurologist.  They declined to accept any additional communication about my medical history.  This conversation was with Judy, his front office staff. I asked to speak to Dr. Davenport directly.  Judy stated that she would have him call me back later this afternoon. Dr. Davenport never called.  He refused to have a conversation with me, instead, having his office personnel relay a medical decision he made without knowing all of the facts.  A medical doctor that refuses to know a patient's full history isn't someone I would recommend to my worst enemy. 
 My late-onset epilepsy is not induced by lights.  I have no light impairment.  Dr. Davenport would know this if he took the time to get to know his patients, but alas, he is driven by dollars first and history never.  Even if it were light-induced or that was his concern, there are ways to protect the patient from the light as it is not shined in their eyes.  The light is used directly in the mouth. 
I know and understand that it is a doctor's right to refuse to do the work in this setting.  My issues stem from my wasted time and his clear and utter disregard for me as a person. If Dr. Davenport felt so strongly about not working with an epileptic patient then I should have been refused service on my first visit, before the impressions for the fluoride trays were even started. Before I was charged 50% for his services. If he felt so strongly about the risks, why didn't he take the time to speak with me and explain, medically, why he could not proceed? Your guess is as good as mine. 
This procedure is the first step in me regaining my smile.  When I was diagnosed with epilepsy 4 years ago I broke a few of my teeth during my first seizure.  There are several steps that I must take to regain my smile and these last 4 years I've done everything I can to make it work.  I want the confidence a beautiful smile can give a person. I've never been treated so poorly by a person in the medical field.  Until today, I had never been on the receiving end of discrimination due to my disability.  If you too are after the confidence a beautiful smile can give you, especially if you are disabled, then I recommend finding another doctor.",2021-01-21 05:22:22,626,3136,

As [Saint] John ""the Apostle"" Cadogan used to infer, it's always BS-o' clock in there.

He pondered , flinched not, & was ready when I swung back in later to bust out another move with. It was all good fun.

This gentleman nudged his team to the tune of appropriate approvals at every bend.

The building is easy to find with its steel bluish gray exterior and purple signs. I walked in and was transported to the Mediterranean! A cute little shop filled with Mediterranean and Middle Eastern foods. Flat breads, all kinds of different pickled and marinated veggies, harrisa, spices and so much more! 

In the cold counter at the front, you can  get pre-made sides of their Hummus, Tzatziki, Baba Ganoush, Tahini and both Greek and Tabouli salads. They also have a few different types of baklava.

On to the food! I wanted to try a few things, so I got Dolmas, Falafel, a Beef Shawarma and baklava. Next time I need to remember to grab a drink. I ordered and while I waited, I browsed the aisles. The food was done quickly and I was soon off to my car to eat. 

After trying the food I can honestly say it's absolutely amazing. The dolma stuffed with rice and savory herbs wrapped in the tangy grape leaves, topped with that strong fresh cheese and dipped in the cool refreshing Tzatziki yogurt sauce. Is to die for. 
The falafel was full of spices and warm and crunchy. Perfect consistency and the tahini gave it a nutty finish that I couldn't get enough of. 
Next time I'll remember to get the tahini on the side for the shawarma, there was so much it was pouring out into the tin foil! You need the tin foil if you don't get that sauce on the side. But it was delicious! 
Finally the baklava was light and crispy with the classic sweet syrup layers and pistachios. 

The food was so truly good, and I found it interesting that Aladdin's is a 100% Halal Certified business! That means all of their food and products are acceptable in accordance with Islamic law!

First, I was pleasantly surprised when I was offered next day appointments. I chose later in the day and was told my car should be done in about an hour. My partner was surprised that they were charging me for the tire rotation, and swore we were told during signing that tire rotations were free with oil changes. Personally, I remember something along those lines, but couldn't remember exactly. They let me know that they provide free tire rotations with oil changes when you buy tires from them. I mean, I kinda did...right? I bought them with the car! I'm not bold enough to push the envelope, but it gave me a chuckle.

Tasting and tour was amazing. Day or event seemed to go well, however behind the scenes items we brought were never set up and I had to do some myself an hour before the wedding that were suppose to be set up by the venue. This neglect on their end was probably due to the fact that our wedding coordinator was giving a tour of the venue to prospective clients. 

We had over $3K in gifts stolen and have yet to receive a response back from the venue on how they will compensate us. They placed our gifts in a location that we assumed would be safe, it was their responsibility to ensure so. We had several members try to collect our gifts and card box on our behalf, (the mother of the bride, the sister of the bride, and a close friend), all were explicitly turned done. Saying that a ""plan"" was discussed beforehand to deliver the gifts to the bride and groom. No plan was ever discussed. When the card box was dropped off to our hotel room after the send-off the lid was broken, but we thought nothing of it. Once we discovered several missing items the next day, we had to contact every guest and ask them if they gave us a gift. This was highly uncomfortable, not to mention inconvenient before catching our flight for our honeymoon. They have now had adequate time to resolve, they will be hearing from our lawyers about this shortly and now we will add on additional damages for emotional distress for all this distress we had to go through contacting guests and the police (since the venue didn't take ownership for it) on our honeymoon. This is all we were thinking about the entire honeymoon. 

Day of the event (in August), there was no A/C working in the bridal suite (read this in other reviews and also notified them the day before and nothing was done) and my wife and her bridal party were dripping in sweat all day doing in the suite trying to do make up (horrible experience for them).

In other reviews, guests said the hot water didn't work in the hotel and that was the same with us for some guests and in the house we rented for the weekend. 

Overall, up front it looks great, but not worth the money. It appears from previous reviews nothing was done on the maintenance of the facility from issues people experienced from years ago. We were however the first wedding since March 2020, so taking that and COVID into consideration, they did work with us, but we're trying to make us pay for an outdoor tent and dance floor on top of the venue we couldn't use was unacceptable. Instead of putting the tent on the nice lawn, we had it on asphalt and had to insist on a dance floor. We ordered a rug to approve the aesthetics under the sweetheart table, we brought it the day of and it simply vanished. This is the one day that details should not have to be worried about, but the venue did a poor job in follow through in this department. Promises and expectations were simply not met. 

Note- it's been almost 6 months and we messaged the regional director, President and info email with no resolution.",2021-01-30 20:46:52,642,3123,

Unbelievably though, it was six weeks  (January 15, 2021) before I was able to use my cooktop without it filling the room with smoke and setting off the smoke alarm.   

It took Grand's installers five trips to install a Jenn-Air range in the same spot two previous Jenn-Air ranges had been. On each trip, the installers (even the ""custom installer"" team who came twice) only looked for the quick answer and did not make sure things were working correctly.  It finally took a visit from a non-Grand appliance repair team to verify that that problem was the incorrect installation and a restricted airflow because of it.  And, in the middle of a pandemic, on the final trip, although I was masked, the installers did not even wear masks.

I appreciate that the sales manager, Patrick, was great to work with and that he took each of my complaints seriously and followed up on them by contacting the installation department each time. I feel if he had not been so responsive that I would still have a non-working appliance.   However, I do fault the installation department:  you charge extra for difficult installations and if you do not want to do them, then do not carry those products in your store.

On the 11th when I didn't hear back from them, I called and they claim that FedEx has not delivered the final part for repair and they will either get it done that evening or the next day it would be ready. Next day came and still no call from them. By this time, I'm just about to just go there and see what's the hold up. Some mechanic that took my call told me it's ready for pick up. First stop was to return the car rental then to pick up the car. When we got to the repair shop, my sister car was a mess with potatoes chip empty bag , dirt's on both driver and passenger floor and her hub cap has all these paint all over it! We end up driving home without my sister car so they can clean the mess and the hub cap. Now my sister had to borrow a family member car to work because she returned her rental. Next day came and no call so when I called, Grace the office lady put me on hold for way too long so I had to hang up and called the Progressive agent about the situation. Grace finally called and left a voice message that the car would be done by 5pm. Keep in mind that they close at 5pm so I drop off my sister to pick up the car around 4:40 and it was pass 5pm before they even released the car to her! So with much examination of the car the next day , we notice her full tank of gas is half gone even though it was not moved to their second location to be repaired, her tired that they claim to replace with a new one still has marking from the accident and what's the purpose of them using her donut wheel, it's very dirty! Looking at the paper that we got for the repair they claim to fix or replace, it's ridiculous how they claim things that got nothing to do with the repair that they claim to have done. BEWARE of these crooks with your car! I'm still waiting for Progressive regarding this matter!",2021-01-17 02:51:23,635,2966,

I lived in Belleville when he opened the OG Beast and as an avid bbq lover (and at the time, I'd been sampling every BBQ in the St. Louis Metro Area) it blew me away. His rejection of typical BBQ dogma was a breath of fresh air. His ability to not just make great BQQ by blending styles and flavors, but his hard work, boots and straps attitude, was a sight to behold. Additionally, the customer service and his attention to detail is unparalleled, which one can easily notice by the quality of sides (usually an afterthought for most bbq proprietors).
After Beast catered my wedding, I moved to St. Louis city for Law school and always wondered if Beast was going to hop the river and dominate the bbq game over here. I was pleasantly surprised when Beast opened in the Grove. I feel the location is ripe for the quality and innovation Beast is known for.
I have since moved to Columbia and lamented the distance to my favorite bbq. I'd brag about Beast and tell the locals about it. However, for the folks in Columbia, Belleville and St. Louis city are only places you go when you want to go to a ball game or you have a court date. I was absolutely stoked when I saw the trademark cleaver where a local bbq joint once sat. 
So, I'm very familiar with Beast, the Double R beef, the Duroc pork, Dave's aversion to tradition, and the polite and professional staff and Beast Southern Kitchen does not disappoint.
My spouse had the smoked wings, which were excellent. The dry rub had a hint of sweet that really adds something special to a dish that most places assume is meant to melt your face off. The homemade ranch was baller as well.
We split a pound of the smoked cauliflower. This dish, I think, outshines my former favorite, the Brussels with belly. Not that the Brussels and belly aren't amazing, but I didn't think anything would top them, until the cauliflower came along. I don't even f**king like cauliflower and I ate almost a pound of it.
I also had the fries with pimento cheese. Man...they are unparalleled. 
Finally, I decided to try something new--Snoot. Now, I want everyone to know that I've never had snoot before. I didn't know what to expect. But, I figured if anyone was going to be my first, it would be Dave. I will say, I didn't like it. Now, that doesn't mean it was bad. I just wasn't a fan of snoot. It reminded me of pork rinds, which I know plenty of people would love it. However, I'm not going to be some dickhead who lets my personal dislike of a dish that doesn't fit my tastes color my review of phenomenal bbq. I'm willing to bet a paycheck that although I didn't like it, a snoot fan would consider it the best snoot they'd ever had. I ain't scared.
To conclude, hats off to Sandusky and crew. They all work hard and have gone above and beyond in the current pandemic and I'm thankful Beast still breathes. I will patron and pimp Beast for years to come because I know very much that Mr. Sandusky puts his heart and soul into his product and he and his team work their asses off so idiots like me can get on here and tell the rest of you c*nts how amazing the food is. You will never find better, I promise.

I cannot stress this enough, the music volume ruined the entire experience and gave me a headache that ruined the entirety of everything else that we had planned for that day.

I don't mind loud music, but when it's to the point where everyone has to yell so that people can hear you (especially when masks are being worn), it's too loud.

I will also say that while staff were all wearing masks, checking temperatures, etc, there definitely wasn't any limitation of seating or social distancing enforced.  Not sure how this place can get such high remarks on COVID accommodations if this is standard. 

I don't mean to harp on it or sound like an old fart, but for the love of God, PLEASE turn down the music.  You don't need it that loud.  At that volume, it doesn't add any enjoyment to your restaurant, only frustration.  You have the food, the atmosphere, and everything else going for you.  Music in a restaurant should be in the background, not the overwhelming force that dominates everything.  

At that point, it's distracting from anything good that may have been.  It's why my entire review has focused on the music, it completely over-powered any other feelings that I may have had.  What did I order?  Was the food good?  How was the service?  Was the place clean?  I don't know, I just remember that the music was way too loud.  

I will always remember how loud that music was and that it ruined that entire day.",2021-01-18 20:22:39,340,1593,

I went to pick up the order that had been transferred from the Castor Ave. store to the Frankford store. Even though your corporate customer service rep ASSURED me there would be no problem, the store wasn't going to honor it. I even showed them the coupon and original order and explained what happened. After 15 mins. of discussion, they allowed the charge.

But here is the worst part:

When I started this, I went to your Castor Ave. store to look at the products. They were not available in the store, so I couldn't see samples. However, I showed the photo clerk your web pages on the products, and she ASSURED me they were printing these directly on wood (like Shutterfly does). I asked several times and she emphatically said yes.

The product I picked up today was not printed on wood. It was simply a photo print placed in a wood block with an acrylic cover - essentially an over-priced picture frame. The clerk at the Frankford store said they do only prints, they can't print directly on the materials (like Shutterfly does).

So... this whole escapade was a massive waste of my time. When Walgreen's files for bankruptcy, I won't shed a tear... unbelievable.

Try getting through to the photo department on the phone!

On Saturday, 1/16, I received a coupon for same-day photo services with a 75% off discount. I submitted two orders on 1/16 (#*881, *828).

On 1/17 I received an email stating that order #*881 was ready.

On 1/17 I received another email saying that order #*828 could not be filled and was cancelled. I called Customer Service and was able to have this order sent to another nearby store. The customer service agent had me resubmit the order, called the store, and got them to approve the 75% expired coupon. 

On 1/19 I was told the other order was delayed and to call the store. I spent HOURS trying to reach someone at the store. I kept being put on hold. I called customer service again, but the person I got this time couldn't help me.

Today, I received notice that the order was cancelled. I cannot resubmit the order with an expired coupon.

I have spent several hours since then trying to resolve this issue with their phone support (unhelpful), store support (can't get through to the photo department) and the Facebook page (nothing they can do - they told me to call customer service).

They need to honor these 75% coupons or tell you the same day they can't print it. I have done everything possible from my side.

When I visited the store before I submitted the order, they told me they could print it. After I submitted the order, they tell me several days later they don't have the materials. I could have sent it to another store if I had been properly notified.

Their customer service is impossible to use and very unhelpful. Phone support in the store is a joke! I spent hours trying to get hold of someone at the store.

Yet, there has to be a better way/ program/ service  for guests to order their drinks and meals now. The ambiance and scenery is always great however, the customer service and food has declined. The App they make you use to order everything isn't user friendly. The host who sat us down at our table did not explain the new policy about the app, and how everything had to be done through the app ( order, pay)  We waited 20 mins before asking for a server to come to our table, then we were told "" sorry, you have to use the app now"" So 45 minutes later our drinks and food come out. We asked for our drinks to come out first as various servers walked by, but they came out about 4 mins before we got our food, which was already cold. Then we asked for napkins. 20 mins go by, we never got our napkins for the messy food. Other restaurants have servers taking table orders while social distancing and wearing masks, why can't this try to be incorporated back here? The staff seems to be very busy but not very attentive to guests, maybe they need more training on noticing tables that have been empty for a long period of time. Another issue was the sewer smell coming from the bathrooms whenever the wind blew, right by the tables In the sand. Not sure if this can be corrected but... worth a mention.

With current times we don't really do much, but today I wasn't letting that happen. We walked in and it was nice to see they made improvements since I was last there. The vide inside is really like old school fun. From the astro carpet, to the sound of the arcade, then the smell of the snack bar. We all four got the ""delux"" wristbands. That was about $25 each person and we got to go everything.
     We went to the go karts first, and had some fun. They are not the fastest right now, but for us and my family we had a blast. Then the kids went to go on a few rides, they loved that also. We decided to let the kids play some games inside while we waited for laser tag. The games where fun, and even a few of them where fun for us that are older haha. We also got a few wings, which I must say are the shinning jewel of this place. Strangely enough some of the best wings I have had in Tucson. No joke I will be back for just those soon!!! We then played laser tag and called it a day. This is the best laser tag in town. 
     All in all the place is really fun for us and the family. We did spend about 125 bucks for the 4 of us, but again we had to get out.

I've been following Donovan's since it was announced, and have been so excited to try it! We finally have to time to drive 30 minutes to Riverview to go to our most anticipated new restaurant, and left very disappointed. We get seated and it's probably 10-15 minutes before our waitress comes over to get us water and introduce herself. Not a big deal. Order our drinks and appetizer, and the wine has very little flavor. We ordered the cheap glasses, so once again kind of on us, but it was $11/glass and tasted like a $5 bottle. Our cheesy corn fritters come out about 25 minutes after ordering them and a manager comes up and apologizes and offers to comp them and a dessert. We're pretty impressed at that point, but then we started to eat them. They were completely tasteless. I even put a slice of jalapeño on one and could barely taste that. Not really upset about it at this point since the manager has already comped it. Then dinner starts to come out. My friend ordered the 6oz filet, I ordered the bone-in ribeye, and we got mac & cheese as a side (which we were told could feed 2-3 people, but it's really just a large side for 1 person). Her filet and the mac comes out, but I'm still waiting. About 15 minutes go by before our waitress comes over and says that somehow my steak had gotten switched to someone else's table, which I knew meant that they were making a new one now. So about 25 minutes after my friend got her steak, I get mine. Right away I'm not very happy, as it was a $50 bone in ribeye that was only about 1/2-3/4 inch thick. That isn't a steakhouse cut and should really be sold for $20-$30. Eating it didn't make things better either, as it was very inconsistent in the cook, being rare in some spots and well done in others. I come to find out that the filet is the same way, and is actually dry. Throughout this whole ordeal, the lights kept flickering and then just shutting off, which again I wouldn't have minded too much, except it just felt like adding salt to a wound at a certain point. Eventually our waitress comes back over and offers us dessert, and we order the chocolate cake, which actually ended up being the best thing we had even though it was pretty average. Also at this point a drunk woman fell into our table spilling her wine on the floor, I really wish I was making this up. Finally our checks come, and the app and dessert hadn't been taken off. Our waitress is nowhere to be seen, and after about 20-25 minutes more of us waiting she comes over and tells us that our app, dessert, and wine had been comped. I was happy that they addressed certain things, but even with all that taken off my steak plus tip was still about $75, which is far from what you'd want to pay for an incredibly disappointing meal. I understand people and restaurants can have bad days, but just the notion that the bad day could result in bad food, very slow service, and the best thing you eat being very average and still having to spend $75, I don't think I can recommend Donovan's, and that really hurts to say since my hopes for it were so high!",2021-01-14 11:07:27,682,3170,

My roommate and I both work downtown but wanted something in an area that was a little less busy and a bit cheaper that what you would pay to live in the heart of it all. 

The first apartment that we lived in wasn't great. When we saw the apartment we ended up moving into, it reeked of a smoky smell from the last tenants. We asked for it to be fixed before we moved in and the leasing agent assured us that it would be. Famous last words. We ended up having to live in an apartment for 12 months that caused our clothes, towels, couch, beds and any other fabric items to suck in the smell. I was honestly embarrassed to go to work with the way that my clothes smelled, so much so that I had a Febreze bottle next to the door that I would spray myself with each time I left. On top of this, the bathroom fan was barely functional, the kitchen fixtures were stuck in the 80's, and the dryer left awesome burn spots on any item of clothing that was lighter than grey. Let me tell you when I say I was super excited to move to a more updated apartment in the complex when our lease was up.

The second apartment we stayed in was definitely a bit nicer than the first by upgrading the carpet to a faux wood flooring, but that's pretty much where the niceness ended. This new apartment faced the parking lot and was right next to the middle stairwell in our building so I would constantly be woken up in the morning by trucks/cars in the complex that clearly needed new mufflers or at night by drunk idiots loudly conversing about their failed DM attempts at 3am. This apartment also came with the added bonus of waking up for work in the morning to a bathroom FULL of flying ants. When I mean full, I don't mean four or five ants, I mean at least 50+ live flying ants swarming in my bathroom. It was disgusting. And what did the complex do? Send in an exterminator three days after I alerted them of the problem! I had to tape off the bathroom to be sure they didn't get into any of our other living spaces.

Don't get me wrong, the amenities at RAWR are nice. You can't beat free parking, a gorgeous pool area, and an Amazon locker for packages, but remember you get what you're paying for in regards to a cheaper price and an outdated apartment.

Pro Tip: If you end up renting here, try to get an apartment on the side of the buildings that faces the forest! It's much quieter and makes you feel like you aren't living in an apartment complex.",2021-01-07 21:19:16,536,2525,

Service 5/5 When arriving we were greeted promptly and told to pick a seat. Our server was the person that seated us and she began serving us immediately. She told us to call her Baby D we think!(it was hard to hear through the masks lol). She was an absolute beast of a waitress. Couldn't have asked for a single thing more from her. Also she was cool as hell. 

Environment 5/5 They were playing great music over the speakers. Had local artists on the walls and the place was spotless. Very hip and a great place to kick back and hang out with friends. 

Food 5/5 We had the Vietnamese Crawfish Étouffée Nachos(our favorite item of the night) and when I say they were amazing.... we almost ate the paper. For our entree we had the Yaka Mein with an order of Cheesy Egg Rolls. Also great tasting. 

Drinks 5/5 they had a good variety of craft beers on tap and all the ones we tried were tasty. Unfortunately they weren't able to serve their own beers yet due to complications from COVID. But the beers they did have were sourced locally. The cocktails we had were also good especially their spin on an Irish Coffee. 

Long review but they don't have a lot so I figured I'd give everyone a comprehensive review. Definitely give this place a shot especially if you are a local. They deserve your business.

My teeth are well maintained and I pride myself in my smile.  I received this welcome to get an offer for a number of free items for New Patients that I've attached an image of it.  I decided to go with Coast Dental even though my gut was telling me not to.  

When I got there, they needed X-rays so they took more X-rays than any of my previous dentists office.  It was very uncomfortable because I felt the person didn't know what she was doing.  I couldn't believe how long she was taking.  Also the hygienist said you HAVE to HAVE the panoramic XRAY which won't be covered by your insurance.  I asked why is it needed and she basically stated that the dentist needed it for cleaning.  I said that sounds ridiculous that he needs to see down to the bone for a basic cleaning which is what I've always had.  I said NO and finally she was like ok.  Then I asked for my free items from the coupon and she said 'Oh, that doesn't apply if you have insurance.  So you can't get any of the free items.  We have you in the system so you can't come back claiming you don't have insurance!'  I mentioned that there is no where on the coupon that mentions that and she said my manager said 'We can't honor the coupon from you unless you don't have insurance.  Just give it to someone who doesn't have any insurance.'  Like I have time to give the coupon to someone else.  Furthermore, I wouldn't put my worse enemy thru that ordeal.    

I really don't like 'bait and switch' coupons but I got a bad feeling about this place and my experience proves my point.  After the upselling for things that I didn't need and then the bait and switch coupon, along with my original feeling, I went back the following business day, requested the Xrays be emailed to me and selected another dental location.   

Just wanted to share my experience so please be careful when selecting new dental providers.  If something doesn't seem right, I'm going to question it.

The menu was easy to read and understand. I was greeted almost immediately and the service was efficient fast and friendly but not phony! It looks like they also sell their sliced deli meat, so I'll probably be back here for sandwich fixings for the house! I ordered the pastrami on rye with deli mustard, Swiss cheese, onions and lettuce. I asked for pickles and they said you get a pickle on the side and when I opened my bag I was excited that they had given me no less than THREE pickle spears! The fact that it was also served in a cardboard tray and then wrapped in plastic before being placed in a paper bag... That had to be good. No sandwich ever served with a catch tray is ever bad. The prices are very reasonable. Yeah they charge a little extra for things like lettuce and tomato but you get a MASSIVE portion of meat. I was served my meal within five minutes of ordering, and also got an orange Fitz's to drink! $14 for this massively huge sandwich and a local bottled soda. Not bad.

The vegetables were crispy, tasty and fresh... Even the iceberg lettuce was impeccable... It actually had flavor and crunch but it was still a lovely shade of green! The onions were crisp but not overpowering. The pickles were a dill pickle lover's dream. I ate two spears and saved the third one for later.

The gentleman at the host station was cold and seemed annoyed at our arrival.  The place was empty except one couple.   We figured it was mainly due to COVID, It being a Sunday night (after Saints playoff game), and the weather (raining and 44 degrees).   Our waiter, Patrick, was great!  A little stiff and too formal for our liking at first, but he warmed up and did a great job taking care of us.  Very professional and tentative without being intrusive.

Batter was light with just the right amount of crunch.  As for the extras that come with it, fries were crispy and well seasoned, house tarter sauce and the purple fennel slaw side, not so great.  The husband had the District Tournedos.  He enjoyed the entire dish.  Scallops were the best he's ever had, filet medallions were cooked as ordered and the green beans were delicious. Our drinks were good.  Nothing too extraordinary but nothing to complain about.  Price was an average for us on a date night ($110 +tip).  Atmosphere was upscale but also inviting.",2021-01-11 06:58:14,325,1588,

My dad came up for a quick visit yesterday, and had a craving for crab legs. We were heading toward the Red Lobster on Dale Mabry, but realized the one on Busch was closer to us, so we decided to go there -- thinking that would be a quicker dinner. Big mistake. Huge.

On the specials board by the hostess stand, we saw filet mignon skewers listed for $3.99. We decided to order two, only for our waiter to say they were actually $4.99. OK, fine. He then came back and told us they just ran out. Not a huge deal, but it was a sign of things to come.

There weren't a whole lot of fish options on the menu except fried cod or the rainbow trout. They didn't have the option to get the cod served any other way except fried, and the trout came with the skin on which I didn't want, so I asked if they had any other kinds of fish. Our waiter said they had tilapia, so I ordered that grilled. Except he then came back to tell me they ran out of that too. I asked if they had the filet mignon still, and he said yes... which means they definitely could've still made those skewers, but whatever. Fine, I got the filet.

From the time it took us to place our orders, we waited an hour for our food. Mind you, there were only maybe five parties in the entire restaurant. This place was dead. How they could make us wait an hour for a steak and snow crab legs (which don't even have to be cooked), I will never understand. I felt bad for our waiter, who kept coming by and apologizing for the wait. I tried to be understanding... but it was a very slow Monday night. Why in the world was it taking this long?

We finally got our food, and my steak was dry, vastly overcooked, and definitely not a filet mignon. Look, I don't expect an amazing steak from a seafood restaurant, but this was a cheap, gristly cut of beef that was a sirloin at best. There's just no way this was a filet. I didn't dare send it back because we'd already been at the restaurant for so long, I couldn't bear the thought of being there any longer than necessary. My dad asked for fries with his crab legs, and they never arrived. He finally asked for a baked potato instead.

Our waiter, who until that point at least had my sympathy, disappeared when it came time to get the bill. We waited another 15 minutes for that, and only got it because my dad got up and found him to ask for it. With my dad's glass of wine and snow crab legs, plus my ""filet"" and a to-go order of fish and chips for my fiance, the total came out to $98. I just felt ripped off.

It takes a lot to get me to write a one-star review, but after spending nearly two hours here for seemingly no reason, this exhausting experience definitely deserved it. If, at any point, we'd ever spotted a manager, we would have said something... but we never saw anyone. I want to support restaurants during the pandemic, but I will never come back to this location. Do better, Red Lobster.",2021-01-05 22:27:22,670,2963,

The crab cakes delicious... po' boy perfect... red fish special mouthwatering... greens BOMB... loaded fried LOADED... service super (STACY is AMAZING!!!..  I'll be sitting in her section here forward). Although I've only had a small portion of the menu, I have no doubt the rest is GREAT! 

I was sad to read the less than 4 star reviews as those encounters do NOT reflect Olde NOLA Cookery accurately. I will agree with one thing, you will have to wait a bit... ‍ COVID 

As much as I am in NOLA, I've never been a tourist. When people would ask me to recommend places, I quickly realized the locations of my suggestions were less than desirable- gas stations, back of corner stores, under highway 90 on fridays (). 2 years ago I decided to be a tourist and go to all the touristy areas to eat. Unfortunately, I was disappointed that these  places captured the essence of New Orleans audibly and visually, but edibley (did I just create that word ,‍) failed. 

A few months back, while walking down bourbon looking for food, specifically a po' boy (it was a challenge as COVID had a lot of place closed), my cousin and I decided to try OLDE NOLA. And that is when I realized I'd stumbled upon GOLD.

All I can say is, I think we have an identity crisis with this Menu. Recommend focusing on 1 specific cuisine and focusing on high quality food thats freshly made.

Ordered soft shell crab sushi. 
I am dead serious, when I say that they served me 6 pieces of gas station sushi that was probably microwaved. 
Anyone who has eaten gas station sushi knows how the texture of the rice is, you know like sticky, gummy, soggy. And to top it off, it was warm which I am sure it was reheated. 

Fried chicken wings.
Not sure if it was old or just over cooked. Chicken was dry, exterior was hard and bland. 

Panang Curry beef.
I have never had panang curry that is yellow/brown in color. All the panang curry I've had have including in Thailand have been this vibrant orange/red color. What I got was bland, yellow brown, soup. The ""curry"" was watery enough to drink with a straw. Bell peppers were raw. They made no attempts to even cook it down even a little. Beef was soft and tender however, only high light. 

Soda was flat and the wedge of lemon they put on the side was so old it had dried up and shriveled. 

The waiter who brought the food had his thumb inside my bowl of rice and his thumb was actually touching my rice. Recommend you grabbing the bottom of the bowl or hand ontop over the bowl.",2021-01-26 16:37:38,306,1438,

The one thing that I want to note for anyone who doesn't have a car during covid: I waited in the cold for 2.5 hours. The place was empty (no one there except the front desk person, and a few people waiting in their cars) . I get that it is procedure during covid and she could maybe lose her job over letting me in. So, I'm not docking points for that. However, I AM docking points because she offered (unprompted from me) to let me sit inside when she learned I live on the other side of town and don't have a car, and it's the middle of the night. Then, she NEVER got back to me about it! Even a ""hey sorry, we can't let you in but wish we could"" would have been sufficient. Instead we made occasional eye contact through the window for almost 3 hours. 

I was also given pretty much no updates during those hours unless I rang the bell and asked (mind you, they can see me the whole time. Only one out there for most of that time.

From the moment you pull up to the stand, you feel welcome and you feel like you're the center of the Kavka coffee universe. There are businesses you experience and you immediately think to yourself ""I want this place to succeed."" Kavka is such a place for me. 

I actually had my eye on experiencing Kavka when I picked up my mask and headed over to Castleton. Interestingly enough, I'd grabbed my lunch and sat down at a small table wondering where it was located. I looked over about 25 feet and there it was right in the food court with a stand-alone kiosk.

You have coffee options, espresso, lattes, mocha, hot chocolate, and a variety of iced drinks along with multiple flavor extras. I read in one of the other reviews that the owner was a barista in Europe - that would explain everything, because it's clearly considered an art and today they were delighted to have me watch them making my iced latte. I don't know if he was truly experiencing joy making the drink, but he certainly looked like he was and he was certainly creating joy all around him. 

This mall-centered kiosk actually feels like a little bit of Europe. It's a pretty wonderful experience and he seemed determined to make sure I enjoyed my drink. The prices are comparable to Starbucks, also in the mall, but I can't fathom a reason you wouldn't go out of your way to experience Kavka. 

Truly, a delight. 

My iced latte was absolutely divine, they have a 16 ounce and a 20 ounce, and the clear plastic cup allowed me to see the mastery of the coffee making and the beautiful color mix. 

All the entrances at the mall are automated and easily accessible. You can easily get to this stand via the food court entrance that will minimize exposure to people. Health directives are in place for masks and social distancing and they were being observed. 
 
It looked like they worked with Julian Roasters and also had some bags of their own branded coffee bagged. I mean, seriously. The quality is wonderful, the ambience surprisingly awesome, and the customer service was absolutely top-notch. If you're in the Castleton area anyway, I definitely recommend seeking them out.",2021-01-23 22:04:20,462,2321,

Some things have changed, and the part that bothers me most has almost totally to do with a banking systems overhaul of a few months ago.  I'm sure they placed the highest priority on accuracy and auditability of the backend database, but...

Online banking from the web is now less intuitive than before, and some functionality is outright missing.  For example, payments queued in BillPay were formerly treated as Pending transactions against the paying account, and now they are only visible in the BillPay segment itself.  There is still a 'Pending' section displayed at the account level, but is not populated with anything.  (They may have somehow redefined 'Pending' to mean something other than what is important to the user.)

As a result, scheduled BillPay payments are no longer downloaded into Quicken or .XLS *until* they are actually paid and become a regular cleared transaction.  You completely lose the ability for a lookahead on the account balance (i.e., to include uncleared 'Pending' scheduled payments) unless you double your effort with a manual entry.  Adding to the irritation, calling customer service got me a response like, ""It's always been that way,"" which is patently false.  The Tier 1 customer service agents don't seem either 'interested' in these being areas of concern, nor willing to escalate them to Tier 2+ support.

The revamped Android banking app has its own issues beyond some non-intuitive layout.  This morning we discovered that our electronically deposited IRS Stimulus payment - visible in the web interface as occurring on Jan. 1 - is completely absent in the app's presentation of account activity.  I haven't yet done a complete audit to see what else isn't displayed, but the lack of accuracy suggested by even this one omission diminishes the app's value significantly.

As a retired IT geek, my initial opinion is they did not build and adequately test their customer-facing software around a robust set of ""user stories"", the scenarios representing customer interactions to accomplish ordinary tasks in the 21st Century.  At a deeper level, any flaw apparent in synchronization between authoritative backend data and the app presentation is alarming and unacceptable.

I hope HFCU ends up taking a hard look at the changes.  I never had an issue with their former systems, and so far I'm disappointed with the new implementation.  It's still a reliable place to do my banking, but they've made it harder to manage.",2021-01-22 18:33:48,499,2663,

Highly discourage friends / family from utilizing Baby Supermart for the baby furniture needs.

Inside feels cozy, a lot of eclectic but fitting pieces to the restaurant's vibe. Since I came during the pandemic, I didn't get to see each corner of the place and would have felt rude browsing around, but I definitely enjoyed the space around me. There aren't many tables, so it could be hit or miss if you have to wait or not. There was just one server and one cook, so they were a bit overwhelmed when we arrived. I saw from other reviews that the food takes time because of the quality, so we weren't bothered waiting a bit -  but our server did give is a biscotti for our wait. 

They were out of the New Orleans iced coffee, but she happily made me a iced latte. The espresso in both lattes had a great deep flavor- was impressed. I also wanted to mention they have paper, not plastic straws here, which is good to see! You can tell from the website and their Instagram page that a lot of attention goes into ingredients - like a salsify root they discovered in the 80s making it into one of their dishes today. The attention to detail makes you excited to eat! As far as the entrees, I was a bit disappointed with the truffle brioche dish. The flavors were decent, but the brioche was very thick and I felt like I needed some more moisture. This may be due to my egg being a little over done. I wish I got something else like the shakshuka. The mushroom strata was full of flavor!

All employees were wearing masks, tables seemed to be a good distance away from each other, all wonderful things right, well, then came the food! We ordered a lot, let me tell ya.. We got calamari, and the meatballs. 
The calamari was good, was it the best I've ever had? No. Only because my personal preference is a crispy calamari and the batter surrounding this wasn't as crispy but that's ok. From the meatball app, we all thought the polenta was the star, it was sooo good! they should honestly think about just doing a polenta and veggies app. I would order that in a heartbeat.
So we order the gnocchi, the ravioli, and boy were those pasta dishes great!! I personally enjoyed the ravioli more as a pesto fan. You can tell it was homemade, I could taste actual pine nuts and the fresh basil in the pesto. We also ordered a margarita pizza and we all thought it was just ok, but again, it's a preference thing. The crust was too soft almost like it wasn't cooked long enough, but it still had really good flavor.

Since I'm a very simple person...gotta give this place the benefit of the doubt. In fact, I actually stopped on by here 2 consecutive days during my time in Reno. Guess that sums it up for me...I liked the food.

Pho 777 is located right in the heart of downtown Reno. I parked along the street, paid the meter and walked right in. They said sit wherever you'd like. Nice and easy. I was handed a menu and kindly asked for hot tea.

Btw, during this Pandemic year of 2020...I was relieved they served dine-in because there's only so many times I can sit and eat in my car. My car has transitioned into a human cafeteria, lol! Seriously, it just felt nice to be human again and sit down at a table. I wore my mask the entire time while waiting for my meal and the waiter had a mask covering his face as well.

Glancing over the menu...they featured choices from 1 - 38 with ingredients describing the dishes below the numbers. Included among the options were...appetizers, Pho Beef Noodle Soups, Rice Noodle Dishes, Stir-Fried Rice and a couple of Chinese Cuisine preparations.
Prices for virtually everything on the menu were $9.95. So whether you get a drink or choose water...with tax and tip it comes to around $15.

For both consecutive days I was here during lunchtime it wasn't busy...but crowded enough with people to feel like this place would be a good spot for some homely, authentic Vietnamese cooking. Ya know...Reno isn't exactly known for it's upscale living...sort of one of these very rundown, stale old gambling towns.

On Day 1 - I ordered the #10 option - a beef noodle soup with vegetables, chicken and rice noodles. After placing it with the waiter...my soup arrived within 5 minutes. Overall, the soup was good. It didn't blow me away with flavor but was comforting enough as I was craving a bowl of Pho. And that's all I could ask for. 

Day 2 - I returned again around lunchtime but this time I decided to try one of the Chinese Cuisines - Option #35 - Generals Chicken With Steamed Rice. Again...service was fast, no problem...and there were just enough customers sitting down to have one waiter serving the entire dining room.

The General Tso's Chicken was decent. It certainly wasn't the tastiest Chinese dish I've ever had...but in the moment I enjoyed it. The dish was hot and fresh from right out of the wok. The breading around the chicken was crispy adding for a nice texture. The only thing or disappointment I had with the dish was that there were no vegetables. It was just the Generals Chicken and white rice. Usually with a meal like this...it gets garnished with a layer of broccoli around it. Oh well. I'm not too fussy about details like these.

In the end...both instances visiting Pho 777 I was yearning for some humbling Vietnamese/Chinese Food and this place performed it's job. I was content each time as the Beef Noodle Soup and Generals Chicken were satisfactory midday meals.

To best describe Pho 777...it's a no frills, casual Vietnamese restaurant good for anyone hanging out in downtown Reno. I would caution to others considering eating here...don't expect much in terms of quality and glitz. The food isn't the greatest, but it's certainly adequate enough to be a sufficient stop for good old fashioned Pho and Noodles.",2021-01-04 18:08:00,701,3344,

They have all the big animals that kids recognize right away.  My daughter loved feeding the giraffe.  There are many other activities to do as well but your have to be 5+.  If you are a Tampa Bay Area local I highly recommend getting a pass to save in the long run and help support the zoo.  The pass also makes for a great gift for kids that are hard to shop for.  The parking is free and with membership you get preferred parking which is closer as well. There are other perks as well such as discounts at the shops, etc.  During this pandemic, the zoo has been a great place to be since its outdoors.  For more cautious people going first thing in the morning is best.  We got in first thing when it opened and left around 11am before it started getting busy.  You don't have to wear a mask in areas you can socially distance properly and for the most part others are respectful.  They give you a mask when entering the park if you don't already have one as basically ask you to use your best judgement.  Only the inclosed areas such as the manatee aquarium area Is where masks are mandatory.  I still find the layout a bit confusing but maybe the more we go the more used to it I'll be.  Also,  some of the signs were wrong due to construction I guess. Adding this to your list of outdoor activities definitely helps with variety for the kids.  Kids 2 and under are free with or without a membership. If you have small kids you only need about 2 hours.  If you have older children you can probably spend more time to do the extra featured excursion (all at additional cost).  Overall, check out the zoo especially if you have kids for a fun filled day of activities.",2021-01-08 03:24:40,370,1781,

Have you ever entered a place, business or nature or otherwise, and immediately felt swept up in its energy?

That's Urban Meditation. 

Recently opened in Fashion Mall Commons across from Keystone's Fashion Mall, I had the opportunity to visit Urban Meditation while simultaneously stopping by to check out the latest location of Smallcakes. 

Leave me alone. I'll admit I went for the dessert first. 

I was intrigued when I saw that Urban Meditation was opening. As a Reiki Master myself, I'm a devotee of wellness and devote much of my energy to wellness activities for those with disabilities. Far too often many of us, myself included, spend so much time devoted to our urgent health concerns that we never really get a chance to focus on being well. 

I'm at least trying to change that. 

There's accessible parking across from Urban Meditation and an appropriate curb cut right next door in front of where Brenner Luggage used to be. Urban Meditation seems like a relatively small place, though I admittedly did not actually go into the meditation classroom. I was briefly able to see it and I'm aware that it's grounded by a lava floor imported from Bali. 

The front door to Urban Meditation is fairly manageable and the counter is right there. Tina is the owner, and I'm pretty sure I briefly met her, and Kristy is also working. They both have a positive energy and are quite helpful. 

I'm sure I did not look like their usual customer - I was more than a little disheveled on my day off and honestly was more curious than anything. I did not take a class upon my first visit, however, I did note the information and took my time looking at their crystals and oils. The smell of this place is incredibly - it practically feels like you're taking a bath in it. 

Meditation classes are offered throughout the day using crystals, oils, and a focus on ambiance. The focus here is on mindfulness. Guided meditation combines with lava rock to help detox mind and body. It's not going to turn a paraplegic like me into someone who walks, but it is going to help empower my own healthy relationship with my body. 

They offer a variety of specials currently ranging from a $39 new client promo that gives unlimited classes x 7 days to $89 a month for unlimited classes to even an annual membership. When I was in yesterday, the annual membership was priced at 50% off. 

Urban Meditation has a front room with a variety of products including quite a few different types of crystals with each well labeled as to how it can help you. These prices vary wildly, though if you're wanting to tiptoe into crystals you can definitely find lower-end pricing. They also have essential oils, diffusers, herbal tea, and other products. Just entering the front room is transformative and Tina or Kristy can answer questions. 

They are, of course, observing current health regulations and require masks and distancing. Classes are currently being maintained smaller to ensure safety. In looking at their schedule, guided meditations are typically 30 minutes and you can schedule online. 

I will admit I've wondered about my own experience in guided meditation - much of the experience depends upon being on the lava floor. This is obviously a challenge with a wheelchair, but this may be something I try to explore as this feels like something I'd like to explore more fully. 

For now, I'll simply say my first experience here was quite positive and it's exciting to see a wellness and healing center open on this side of town. If you've wondered about guided meditation, definitely give them a visit.",2021-01-01 23:40:04,738,3761,

Thus, I was excited to find Sapporo 2 as an option for dine in a time where most other sushi spots were only offering to go due to the pandemic. Upon finding it, I wish I could say I were equally as excited after having completed my dining experience here. 

A friend and I came here for dinner, having been long over due for a sushi date. We walked in, and were a bit surprised to find we were the only people there. We were told to sit wherever we wanted, and upon doing so were immediately given water. Sadly, it was a good amount of time before we were visited to put in our order. This was the biggest issue I had with Sapporo 2 , the service.  Our food took a while to arrive. And once it was delivered, we were not checked on until a good 20+ minutes after we were both done eating. Seemingly, they were busy the whole time with carryout/delivery orders..... However, one would think a restaurant would put the most time and effort into taking care of people who took the time to come in and dine in.

I can see past bad service if every other area of a dining experience is on point, but it simply wasn't.  The sushi was subpar. Everything was on the more room temperature side to me. Nothing really tasted fresh. The rolls were clunky, and fell apart. 

With plenty of other sushi spots in St Louis, I'll pass on going back. Guess I'll have to settle for takeout/delivery for now if I'm having a sushi craving.",2021-01-06 20:22:01,319,1491,
OjODwDobRkhAta9_0t8rhQ,XeP87cBjb-okltlrWzSLGQ,h1gzHYYXaQ6a3Eugsp6MDw,1,5,0,0,"I have been in the auto industry giving loans to Hughes for 20 years in Phoenix..... I am embarrassed! I feel I have inadvertently  personally put thousands of people in harms way. 

Let me explain. My little brother passed way on November 7th of 2020. When he passed, my sister and I were left to get his affairs in order. One of the affairs happens to be with Hughes Federal Credit Union. I promptly called them to inform them of the situation. I let them know the loaned asset (truck) was out of state with the exact address. When I had this conversation I also stated I would most likely just refinance his truck due to not being ready to let him go.

So when I stated I would have a local bank finance the loan. A young man stated they could just refinance the loan in my name to make things easier. I said great and let me check with probate to make sure exactly what I'll need to do.

So I called back in to let them know we were having a bit of a delay in probate and spoke to a young lady. She stated to me that what I was told was false and I would need to refinance through a local bank. I stated that was not a problem and asked what I would need to do to get a clear title. If you can believe this. She states I would not need one to get a loan! So being surprised, I let her know I was in the industry and this is not correct. I literally stated ""so I can get a loan on my neighbors car, pay it off, and take they're car?"" and she said that's correct! I couldn't believe it! I couldn't take it any longer and hung up. 

Then I get the a call from Manny (520) 205-5649. He lets me know that everything that lady stated in false. So recap. 3 conversation, 3 different people, 2 stated the others were wrong. So speaking with Manny we talked about the options I had. I told him I would refi through a bank here and get him paid. we talked about a couple options on how to get the title. I sent a death certificate with a court order of title. He let me know he got it and I let him know I would need the account number to give to the bank to get them paid off. He calls me back with the account number and member number to give to the bank so to transfer the money and pay off the loan. 

OK so here we go. I go to the bank get a great approval from State Employees FCU and the loan officer said she would need to call Hughes to get the pay off and get the process for the lean release. So I call Manny. Manny picks up and tells her he would not give the bank a lean release, the release would go through the DMV in a couple weeks. The Loan officer went back and forth a couple times and stated to me ""what kind of bank is this!"". Manny said ""give me 5 min and I'll call you right back.

Manny calls. He tells me Leticia said they could not and would not help in this matter and they do not negotiate a title. I ask Manny. Why did you tell me to get a loan, send you the death certificate, get and sent you the court order if you were going to tell me you wouldn't sent the information to the bank to pay it off. He then tells me ""I never told you to get a loan for the car but to get a personal loan"" At this point I'm beyond frustrated and ask him what does he expect to do? He then tells me to Reposes the truck! Getting heated I asked him if this is a way they get bonuses or is this a pay check thing? What the hell? He lets me know that he didn't like my tone. Stated I was very nice till this call and he would have Leticia call me. Guess what?! No call.

So again. I'm very sorry to all the people I put through Hughes Feder Credit Union in my 20 years of auto loans. They are stealing my brothers car and I can't imagine what they have done to all of you.",2021-01-06 02:06:57,839,3675,

I have a small antiques business, and all my clients are in the United States.  

Despite expert packaging, and the required 3 invoices for customs clearance, my shipment is being held at the border...for no discernible reason whatsoever.  

Every time there is an issue with a shipment (it's every time I use UPS now), the minimum amount of time I have to invest sorting things out is 2 hours.  

I'm operating a business single-handedly, so all of these delays put an extremely serious crimp in productivity. 

The last time there was a clearance issue, it took three weeks to resolve, and the shipment also went missing on its way to NY.  

How embarrassing is it to explain to a customer that his valuable table is not only delayed, but completely missing as well?  It'll ruin your reputation if you don't have understanding customers. 

Importing is equally as harrowing.  It's fortunate that I restore antiques, as a valuable Boulle pier cabinet arrived in pieces.  It was obvious from the packaging that at some point in its journey it had fallen from a great height.  Not even a breath of an apology from UPS.  

So, not only did I have to waste my time wrangling with UPS over my broken cabinet, I also had to repair the cabinet before it was saleable. This was a major setback, needless to say. 

Fast forward to my latest experience: an expensive bureau de dame on its way to an important client in California.  A client very interested in making purchases in the future.  Despite doing EVERYTHING correctly, the bureau is stuck at the border, and I've spent the the bulk of the morning trying to sort things out.  As of 11am, there's still no resolution.  

Work is backing up, I have an important new customer whom I cannot afford to offend, and my entire future is dependent on the efficiency of UPS. 

Never again, UPS.  Canada Post will get all my small parcels, and DHL the rest.",2021-01-20 19:11:30,391,1936,

Staff members were incredibly nice. Upon asking a couple of wine specific questions they didn't seem very dialed in though. While I have to admit I don't remember specifically what they said, the spirit of their answers were very much in the, ""I don't know, I think that one is really dry"", level of wine talk.

The feeling inside this glass walled building is actually pretty cool. I was there at Christmas so to see Christmas shoppers walking around outside added to the atmosphere.

Then came the food. I had asked for a pasta dish but with a different pasta from another dish on the menu. I was told the chef doesn't like doing that. With that I thought two things: I know for a fact switching up pasta is no big deal, but maybe this is a chef with integrity. OK, I'll order something to see what this chef is about. I decided against pasta and went with their meatballs as I was having a good, meaty red. Also I am purpose order something basic first time into a menu. If the chef handles basics well the rest of the menu is usually very good. Well, I'll eat my hat if those meatballs weren't pre-bought/pre-formed. I have honest to God had better ones out of a bag from Safeway. I was asked if I'd like bread with that to dip into the sauce. Sure! Turned out it's bread they charge for. Wasn't informed. I only had one dish here, sure, but the BS about chef integrity over a pasta coupled with the eventual big fail of the meatballs left me not wanting to dip any further into their menu.

I have to say the Dunham Bordeaux blend I had was decent. Not $15 glass in my opinion, but decent. Also a heads up for anyone going here for the first time - these are wines served from a dispenser. I don't care how ""fresh"" it keeps the wines, it's pretty damn un-sexy. 

My opinion? Go across the street to the giant Albertson's supermarket, get the fixings for meatballs, make them yourself, and spend the money buying a nice bottle from their downright fantastic wine collection. Money much better spent.

Would have been two stars if it wasn't for how pleasant my server was.",2021-01-06 12:43:12,481,2241,

Our waiter was Benjamin C. He was the best waiter we have ever had!!! He was constant with coming around and checking to make sure we were good with drinks and everything was to our satisfaction. When our first out of two appetizers came out we did our individual prayer and so I had finished praying and my husband was still praying. Benjamin stood aside without interrupting us. Knowing he still had other tables to serve and there was also other waiters around moving about he still respected that we were praying and waiting for us to finish. That there was a BIG plus for us. Never have we experienced anyone who waited for us to finish praying before coming and putting the food on the table. Many should learn from him!!! Well, we ordered the calamari and meatballs as appetizers. Both were delicious!! The calamari could have been a bit more crunchy but the flavor was on point!! The meatballs were firm but especially tasty!!! They were served on a bed of polenta with tomato red sauce. Very delicious!!! 
Now for the main courses!! Skirt steak, goat cheese ravioli, margherita pizza and stuffed cheese gnocchi!!! The steak perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection!! Meat candy if you will!! The goat cheese ravioli in a pesto sauce absolutely wonderful!! Flavorful and creamy with the hint of goat cheese taste at the end. The stuffed gnocchi was also another creamy dish!! Freshly made everyday!! Made in a vodka sauce!!! Mouth watering dish!!! Tiny soft pillow gnocchi in a bath of tomatoy vidka sauce. Creamy and a hint of tartness. To die for!! A win!!

The server lost my credit card for 30 minutes and called me a lair about giving her my card as payment!
(Obviously i didn't lie if they found it in a trash can in the kitchen!!!!!)
HOW, HOW did this happen? 
I  have never been treated so poorly, I came in for my friends birthday with a party of 16 people.
We placed our orders all the food came out at the same time except my boyfriends, he is not a seafood guy but came to enjoy the party they had chicken pasta on the menu so he ordered that. Sadly by the time he received it everyone was pretty much done. They came over and apologized and comped it for him. OK , that was nice so we moved on. 
When everyone was done no one came to check on us, there where a few children now becoming fussy so the parents where standing and talking... we obviously looked ready to go. I  found the manager and asked if he could find someone to check us out and to start clearing our 2 party tables. Our waitress Keisha came, said that she was so busy she was sorry about the wait. I told her that she had earlier taken our birthday treats we brought to the refrigerator in back of I could please have it before everyone leaves. She brought it over and told us it would be a minute while she figured out how to separate all our orders. We ate the cake and chatted still no checks? 
When she comes out she starts handing them out and every one starts telling her this or that was incorrect.   (our friends don't want to pay for  items someone else recieved)
So she collected them all and made some notes and set off to try again.
Some of the party at this are getting upset we are all irritated about this wait.
1 couple gave us cash and said it would cover their bill any change give to the waitress. We said good bye. 
Another friend asked her husband to wait and pay she needed to put the kids in the car they where getting grouchy.
Now 6 of 16 have gone no checks paid yet. 
Waitress comes out and half the checks are correct  mine was correct I gave her my card along with the slip. She left to fix the last two checks and cash out the ones who where correct. She returns about another 10 minutes later with receipts and the last two checks that are now correct. 
Most people have now left I'm still waiting on my receipt she brings out the last two receipts and their cards, so I ask for mine.
SHE SAID I NEVER GAVE HER MY PAYMENT!
I told her nicely that I had it was a yellow suntrust card for 64dollars I owed.
SHE STILL INSISTED I NEVER GAVE HER MY PAYMENT!
I'm getting irritated, anyone who knows me i am very good at keeping my cool.
I told her she needed to go find my card and her manager right now!
She asked me to stand up and told me I must have dropped it!
I told her again that she has my card its not on the floor! So I stood and said ""Well take a look then, but I need a manger.""
She looks on the floor and under the dirty dishes that have now been here almost an hour!
She then tells me that she was sorry I lost my card but that she has never lost a customers payment and that she is very responsible. 
She empties her pockets on my table her apron her bill fold and all her tips for the night and a said see I don't have your card!
I'm so mad at this point. 
I calmly told her I need you to find my card.
She leaves again and her manager comes up and said I was told you lost your card!
I LOST MY CARD. 
I told him I gave the waitress my card that if you have cameras I want them checked!
He said that they don't have any unfortunately that he will try to find my card.
I see everyone at this point staring, other waitress have gathered and are talking and looking over at me. 
My boyfriend Is so mad i had to tell him to calm down and just let me handle it.
If he had it his way he would be causing one heck of a scene.
He has been giving death glares along with his best friend that stayed behind to make sure everything is OK while his fiance is in the car waiting with their teenager.
Then Keisha come running out holding my card she says I found it !! 
She is wiping it off trying to explain that she must have thrown it away when she was trying to take payment and clear a few dishes, that it simply got lost in the mix! She is wiping it off on her shirt and handed it to me the manager comes behind her with a sanitized wipe to clean my card that had been handed to me covered in what I assume is butter and gunk.
I took it back and and started to wipe it off they told me they would be right back with my new bill.
Only Keisha came out, not the manager? She said that they have removed one whisky sour from my bill.
I looked at her and said I need your manager because I'm not paying you.
She came back with a new bill no manager he must be tired of my boyfriend and his friends death glare and my inconvenience of a situation.",2021-01-30 20:56:42,1061,4845,

Dinner was just okay. I got the filet mignon and was surprised how reasonably priced it was. I was a little disappointed that it was drenched in mushroom gravy which took away from the meat itself. Yes, I could've asked for it on the side but as a first time visitor I was here to experience the food as it is served, without modification. My green beans were fresh but a little bland. And my mashed potatoes had great flavor but were cold. 

Breakfast was great!! I finally got the corned beef hash that I've been missing since Johnny Grits changed their recipe. Breakfast is what earned this place a 4 star rating. 

The grits skillet was so dang good. We got a bacon cheddar and the bacon was so deliciously crispy and so was the melted cheese on top. We will come back JUST for more of these!

Biscuits and gravy were good. Flavor-wise anyway. The biscuit was kinda hard, either because it wasn't fresh or it was over baked. But the gravy was good so I'm hoping we just caught the biscuits on an off-day.

The breakfast potatoes were seasoned nicely and cooked crispy. 

As far as COVID safety: The staff aren't real great about wearing masks that actually cover their faces but they all have them on. There aren't salt and pepper shakers on the table, instead I was happy to see individual packets. Same with hot sauce, it was served to us as a single serving.

Usually you'd venture into the city for this kind of cuisine. It's therefore pretty niche, and they delivered on their promise that even non-vegans can enjoy it. 
As a situational pescatarian (lol), I try to limit my animal-product consumption chiefly for the environment. I don't think Cheezy Vegan shares this priority, but that's okay -- these practices could also be due to COVID. They give you styrofoam takeout containers, plastic utensils in plastic wrap, plastic straws, cups, etc. I hope to see some improvement there, but by not serving any animal products, they're probably more sustainable than most restaurants! 
The ambience/ interior could use some work, but I know they're just a brand new biz trying to make their way. They had fake brick wallpaper -- very tacky. Above that was another panel of white wallpaper which could use some more character. 
We came for brunch on a Thursday morning and there was only one person on the wait staff -- she was sweet as could be! We were the only ones in the restaurant too, and they seemed a bit frazzled to have in-person diners (maybe more of a takeout-kinda place nowadays). I was surprised that they didn't have something as simple as an iced coffee when I inquired about drinks. 
Now for the food. I definitely ordered wrong and wasn't super hungry upon arrival, so when my plate of the ultimate biscuit arrived (it was listed under ""foodie favorites"" on the menu) I wasn't exactly anxious to jump in. I'll say that it certainly wasn't this foodie's favorite, but my sister really enjoyed her McReeky breakfast sandwich. Mine just smelled overwhelmingly of salt, and the gravy too much so reminded me of vomit. I was really impressed by the vegan eggs, they resembled the texture of real scrambled eggs to a 't.' The chick'n was the highlight of the plate -- it tasted so real it was fREEKY! (Haha, the chef's name is Reeky). Next time I'm going to try the chick'n and waffles, as that sounds more up my alley!

So we drove 200 miles to spend my wife's 50th Birthday in a place we couldn't wait to finally check out, spent $110.00 on food &  alcohol, gave the band a $5.00 tip, & never heard her 1 requested song, cause she didn't have $15.00 more. That's pretty rotten in my opinion, cause that's a milestone birthday that especially women remember, that will forever be etched in her memory. They never even announced  happy birthday to her at all. & then told here she couldn't dance, even by herself because of covid.lol
 I always that the movie ""Footloose"" was just funny & could never happen, guess I was wrong.lol
I mean we liked the place alright, food was good, atmosphere was good, 
if the band would have did the right thing, tips shouldn't dictate them playing a song, ever, especially for a woman spending her 50th Birthday in their establishment. We were customers spending lots of money that we really didn't have to start with. Just expected the band to care more for people & not just money. The singer spent most of the night walking thru the crowd with the tip bucket, kinda makes it uncomfortable for people that don't have money to put in it. We never did that at our shows. Just a little rude. But  let me reiterate, they were really good, Ive been a musician all my life, I was impressed. Great voices, guitarist never made 1 mistake, drummer was  phenomenal.",2021-01-22 18:27:30,465,2088,

To say I was happy with my experience here at this IHOP is a vast understatement. I am full and elated (possibly a slight sugar-high from the blueberries)!

I ordered the Spicy Poblano Omelette that came with toast or a 3-stack of pancakes. I mean, really-- who's going to get toast when they can have pancakes? ;)

I figured, given their name, this place made good pancakes. I can now say I know what an excellent pancake should taste like! Fluffy and perfectly browned. I chose the blueberries topping and it was a generous but not drowning river cascading over the short stack. The light dusting of powdered sugar and mound of whipped topping made this portion of my meal a party in my mouth! (Again, I think I'm on a sugar high! Lol!!)

As for the omelette--excellent!  How 3 eggs can embrace so much flavor is a mystery and this comes from someone who can make good  omelettes.  The combination of heat of the peppers and coolness of avocado was perfect. The portion was enough for 2 hungry people which is why 2/3rds of it will be taken back to where I'm staying. Breakfast tomorrow! I may go to sleep again today so I can wake up for breakfast tonight! 

Service:  Alex, my server, had perfect timing, made great suggestions, and was pleasant and professional with everyone in his station. He's getting a good tip!

We walked in and saw that this place is huge. There are tables everywhere. It is spacious and appeared to be really clean which is definitely a plus during COVID! It was pretty empty which kinda made me worry a little bit about how good it was going to be. 

After being seated, we waited a little longer than I would have expected especially for how empty it was so minus one star. Once the waiter showed up he was really nice though. He promptly took our order. I asked him a question he wasn't sure about and instead of just saying ""I don't know"" he said ""I'm not sure but let me go find out for you."" I really appreciated that. While waiting for our food he came over several times updating us on how much longer our appetizer would be and same thing for our entree. It's not often you have a waiter do this for you.

Everything that we ordered that was fried was really crispy. My son's catfish was big fillets which sometimes can be mushy and have a stronger taste. That was not the case at all. The fish was flaky and had a mild delightful catfish taste. He got a lot of food for being a $4 kid's plate. I got the seafood pot LA style. It had the right amount of flavor. There was a cup of seasoning on the side that I opted not to use because it tasted good like it was and I'm not a fan of sprinkling seasoning on boiled or steamed seafood. That seasoning was really yummy though and we used it on other stuff. My raw oysters were properly de connected from from the shell which seems to be rare in restaurants these days so that was a big plus! 

Overall we had a good experience and will be returning!",2021-01-17 13:51:56,383,1776,

This makes it one of Indy's oldest public parks. The pool opened in 1930 and in 1962 an ice rink was installed. 

The park encompasses 42 acres and includes two playgrounds, sand volleyball courts, tennis courts, football/softball/baseball areas, and has played host to the popular Irvington Farmer's Market. It's also a popular spot for Indy Parks concerts. Those into geocaching should note the park actually is host to multiple individual geocaches. 

The park is actually surprisingly undeveloped. It has rolling hills, a popular spot for winter sledding, and a good amount of the park doesn't even have sidewalks. It's remained quite natural over the years with lots of mature trees. 

As a wheelchair user, of course, this can be somewhat frustrating given that a certain amount of development is needed to be accessible. While I love Ellenberger Park as a place to visit, there are geocaches I can't reach and places where I risk tipping over if I venture to them. Trust me, I've done it more than once. 

The park is close to most Irvington area restaurants along with the adjacent Pleasant Run and nearby 10th Street. 

The Park is named after John Ellenberger, whose family owned much of the land in the area and who'd been generous with the community and had often let residents use the land. In fact, there was controversy when the park was ""officially"" established as it required a tax hike. People couldn't figure out why they were being asked to pay taxes for something they'd already been using for free. 

But, they did. 

The park temporarily changed names, but residents again protested and it returned to Ellenberger Park as it has been since the early 1920s.

Ellenberger Park lacks sheltered picnic areas and public restrooms. There was talk of creating more parking, but it would have cost the sledding hill and that was too steep a price to pay (Sorry, couldn't resist). 

The ice rink was closed in 2009 due to needed repairs that were deemed too expensive. Even the ball fields don't have seating with them. 

Ellenberger Park is that rarity - a rather large park more focused on nature than activity. While I can't quite go a 5-star because of accessibility issues and some general upkeep concerns, it remains a place I visit often.",2021-01-14 20:37:24,463,2380,

I consider myself somewhat of a gumbo and bloody Mary connoisseur, among other things. Both were disappointing in different ways. I wanted to have a classic Southern cuisine experience for brunch and I was not disappointed. 

I had the traditional shrimp and grits and it was even tastier than it is beautiful. There are hot grits nestled in down a creamy blanket of maque choux. I don't recall there being bits of andouille sausage included as described, but it's hard to tell if it were ground up into the maque choux. It was still delicious though, no question. This was a fantastic dish, one of their best. 

The gumbo was also very good, but the menu description did not mention the okra. This was definitely okra gumbo, of which I am usually not a fan, although it is traditional for gumbo. I probably would not have ordered this if I knew it were okra gumbo. I found the okra to be slightly mushy, but it was still a good bowl of gumbo. I'm not sure it's worth the $10 for it being such a shallow bowl, but I'd still order it again if I really wanted some gumbo.

My travel partner ordered the Amelie Egg Plate, a very basic breakfast plate. It was satisfactory and well prepared. Nothing exciting or over-the-top, but still a good breakfast, nonetheless. The croissant was more flaky than moist. But everyone knows there's nothing like a Parisian croissant. Eat inside during the colder months to enjoy the croissant more.

I've been trying a new favorite drink more frequently lately, the bloody Mary. Unfortunately, this one tasted like straight pepper. I didn't mention it to our server and I did choke through the rest of it. It was nice having pepper topping the olive and green bean on top.

Our server was Greg and he did a terrific job. He was attentive and checked on us regularly. He was also knowledgeable about the history of the property when we asked him questions. He pointed out the building where the first American princess of Monaco lived in New Orleans, Amelie, and pointed out the carriage house. The overall atmosphere was nice and they had a nice selection of music playing - some soulful golden oldies. The patio area is nice, even if a little cramped in a few areas. It's beautiful scenery, being surrounded by historic structures with rich stories. I would love to visit again!

You can't always take Yelp's word. The couple photos of the pizza we saw looked decent maybe. The photos of the menu on the wall at Giovannis looked promising. It looks like it has a real deal old school pizza parlor vibe. We were wrong. We wanted to get Tharios, but the phone was relentlessly busy.  The photos of the pizza there looks legit. People say there is no good pizza in California. It's all just that doughy garbage low quality pizza. But this isn't true anymore. Search around California and you can find amazing pizza. Thin crust. High quality ingredients. Times have changed and California finally has good pizza. This place Giovannis, unfortunately is not in the category of good pizza. This is not quality. It's the other category, expensive garbage pizza. Heartburn inducing. Bad flavor. Floppy. Bad crust. Margarita pizza was actually gross. It's hard to make truly ""bad pizza"". It's dough and cheese and tomatoes. What's not to like? But somehow this place did it. It was such a let down. I only gave two stars because I don't think ANY restaurant deserves one star unless they have terrible food and terrible service and are consistently terrible. That would be a true one star. This place is a true two star. Just low quality and too expensive.  Disappointing. Unfortunately it seems like Carpinteria just DOES NOT have a good pizza place. Serious business opportunity in this town if someone could make some quality thin crust football pizza. Even a nice Neapolitan fancy pizza place would probably do well.

Sectioning off into a shop, champagne bar, the restaurant and a library. I encourage you to explore a bit before grabbing a bite to eat. 

On a Friday morning (11am) it was pretty busy (as expected) but we were sat immediately after checking into our reservation. We sat by the fountain in their enclosed outdoor seating. The view was beautiful, and it was pretty cool out so it was perfect. I'm not sure I would want to sit here in the summer as it didn't have A/C.  We had the amazing John as our server. He was attentive, informative and made sure we had everything we needed when we needed it (without asking). It was almost as if he could read our minds! Lol. 

We ordered and our food came quickly! I had the delicious smoked salmon on a everything bagel, with cream cheese, pickled onions, caper berries and I added the avocado for $2 more. I splurged and also ordered the truffle Mac (because why not!?)  Both delicious! The bagel was big, and they didn't skimp on the toppings either! Our seasonal matcha lattes did take a bit to come but were so good, that I had to order a SECOND one! ($7 each). Our bills came in a book and which I loved. I thought it was super unique, resourceful and fun! My total came out to $46 (20% tip included) which is a bit pricey for brunch (oops) but I did take home left overs and had a nice matcha to go!

I have never had an issue until December20, 2020. I took an unexpected trip to Charlotte, went inside the office to get my new access code and keys.
The reason for me having to retrieve these things is because back August of 2020 , the property management staff called to inform me, that , "" they were changing the locks.""

I didn't think much about it but I did ask, ""Who was going to be with whomever is changing locks?""
According to the young lady I spoke with she states, ""Oh, there will be an outside bonding company to monitor the actions of whoever is changing the locks""........
WELL I have lived in Philadelphia, PA since December of 2013......The last time I was in my unit was on April 15, 2017, the weekend of my mother's funeral.

So on my surprise visit of December 20, 2020 I discovered my unit was burglarized and destroyed. Many pieces of my furniture was damaged, TVs were stolen, clothes were stolen, painting were stolen, a plastic jewelry box was stolen, and who knows what else. Those were the things I could see from the top of the unit.

I called the CMPD in Charlotte filed a report, filed a claim with the Orange Door Insurance Company, and have been trying to reach the District Manage of the location. 
It gets deeper because the Customer Service Supervisor told me, "" that the location of my unit had over 12 units burglarized in August of 2020 and they evicted that renter. Also we called ALL THE TENANTS TO LET THE KNOW! ""

itM2F9ZG9J6asHu-yKFUpA,UDTgG9lmGxmQ-3xAybvl-w,3TiiBHuBCQi27-ynhut9Ng,2,0,0,0,"This was one of the most disappointing restaurant experiences I have had in a long time.

The two stars are not a one star because (1) the food was edible and  (2) the staff was nice.

The low review is because (1) the order was wrong after multiple attempts to get it right, (2) they let the food sit and get cold, and (3) the food just wasn't that good.

This was very upsetting. After a pleasant experience when Joella's first opened pre-COVID, my husband and I decided to do our ""once in a blue moon"" pandemic takeout to give us a break from cooking dinner after a busy week. This experience served to remind me why I continue to cook almost the entirety of my meals at home.

We got a reasonably hefty order: the chicken finger 5-heat sampler, a dark meat meal (adding an extra leg and thigh) and the 4 side sampler.

First, online ordering with Joella's sucks in that you can't pick a time for your pick up to order and plan ahead which fortunately/unfortunately really didn't matter in this situation.

Got a text message saying the food would be ready in 15 minutes. Jumped in the car and headed over. 

We were the only customers when we arrived, except for one drive thru order. (Understandably so in hind sight)

My husband went in to pick up the order. First off, it took 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge he was there to pick up an order while the staff member kept running back and forth between the kitchen and soda machine...for ONE drive thru order.

When someone did finally get to his order (which had been sitting getting cold and soggy for well over 10 minutes at this point), they let him know that they were out of kale salad and had gone looking for kale, but realized they didn't have any kale so would he like a different side. He chose a different side.

Ten minutes later, they came back with the order and substituted side (still no other customers in the restaurant). He brought the order out to the car, and I went through as best I could to check if anything was missing. There was only one leg/thigh included and then a random chicken finger in its own container. I thought they accidentally gave us an extra finger accidentally instead of the extra leg/thigh that we ordered. He brought the finger in to show them to which they said that was the fire in the hole finger which they keep separate because of its heat level. (Makes sense) However, they said the leg/thigh were in their own container. 

He comes back to the car and grabs the leg/thigh box. After about 5 minutes more of discussion, they realize he had ordered an EXTRA leg/thigh, which they said they had never seen before. (?!?!?!)

Now about 30-35 minutes after we arrived to pick up our order, we finally get it.

We get home, and we are also missing our collard greens and they gave us the wrong dipping sauces.

On top of the disorganization, length of visit and problems with our order, ultimately the food was greasy and flavorless. (How do you have greasy vinegar slaw?!?) The chicken was mediocre quality, even for a fast food place.

45 minutes of our lives, $35 down the hole and a gross icky mouth and stomach made this one bad experience.

My husband does want me to reiterate, though, that the staff was very nice.

Took about 10 minutes to receive a greeting from one of the two bartenders. Which I thought was kind of odd bc it wasn't busy, and it takes 2 seconds to say ""hey guys! Thanks for coming in, I'll be right with you"". We almost just left. I don't like giving businesses to restuarants who could really care less if you were sitting there or not. If I wanted zero service I would have cooked for myself at home, which would've cost about 1/8 the price.

When the bartender finally did come over, he wasn't very warm or friendly, kinda just gave odd vibes. I remember visiting Nashville six years ago before living here, and I always had SUCH memorable experiences with bartenders, waiters etc. It goes SO far to have great service, and it's so easy to provide that... you just put a bit of effort in, ask what our plans are for the evening, have we been in before, are we visting etc. Considering the Gulch is a tourist hot spot, people are most likely spending one of their precious vacation nights at YOUR restaurant. It's the reason you have a job. You'd think you'd take a little more pride in your job and workplace. It's gone downhill quite a bit in this town when it comes to the service industry. Too many Californians and New Yorkers coming here I think. lol.

The third bartender that came in is an older guy with gray hair, he was MUCH more personable. He actually introduced himself and told us his name, which the other bartender didn't even bother doing. 

FOOD:
Overpriced for what it is in all honesty. My favorite sushi spot is Oku. Service CAN hit or miss, but most of the time the service is great, they're friendly, happy to be there, knowledgable about the menu and they're excited for you to have a good experience. Their food is second to none in nashville so far as sushi goes. Their prices are similar, but the fish is better. A few of the rolls we had were just kind of tasteless and lacking something.

It took us a very long time before we could even find someone to give us any help in signing up for this service. We had to pay $150 to get both places measured. While we were finding out this information, we were talking to the person who was helping us and we explained that one of the kitchens had a really bad roof leak, so that all the cabinets on one side got torn out and the wall had to be rebuilt. That there was no drywall and that the flooring was going to be replaced was also mentioned.  

We told her that we had someone in place to replace the flooring and the windows, but, we needed someone to help us plan the kitchen and help us sort out persons to do the dry wall, etc, as well as how to make it look nice.

They told us someone would be out to measure in 24-48 hours. No. It took longer than that. He was pleasant, though, and informative.There was nothing about the process that gave me any worries. He told us it would be 24-48 hours before his notes got into the system and then we will be called soon after to make an appt., but we could call to set one up instead. 48 hours would have been Thursday. On Friday, I tried to call Lowe's, repeatedly, and there was no answer. So,  on Saturday, we went to the store, went to customer service and told the very nice lady why we were there. 

We were escorted back to the design area by a person who, later, told us he manages three different departments. On the way, he asked me if we were going to have custom cabinets built. I said, ""Probably not. Probably just stock, because, there is a lot that needs to be done."" He asked me if we are going to want them to do flooring, too. I told him no. Because, as a Lowe's representative had already been told, we had someone else in place to do the flooring. 

Shortly after we sat down with him, he informed us that the installer would not install the cabinets, because, there are conditions that they do not find acceptable or which have not been met. Something like that.  And, then, we proceeded to go through what would be a very funny conversation in a movie, but, is a horror story in real life. 

He told us he could not give us the measurements because the measurements belong to them. That we paid to have the rooms measured for Lowe's, so that their installer could do the install. But, the installer does not want to do the install, so we cannot have a kitchen planned by Lowe's, because, the measurements are only for their installer. That's when he said he is a manage of three departments and they have never given anyone the measurements for anything. 

This is not what we were told when we made the appointment. We had specifically talked about possibly using the kitchen plan to buy materials from Lowe's and to have the installation done by the guy who is doing our flooring and not only were we not told that this could not be done; we were specifically told that it could be or we could hire Lowe's to do the install. 

Well, after my sister got righteously upset that the manager was telling her she could not have her money back since we did have our kitchens measured, even though the measurements were not going to be given to us and the installer would not be installing anything, and, no kitchen planning would happen, because, the kitchen planning is done with measurements that Lowe's owns for their installer, even though $150 was paid for those measurements to be taken and we had made NO AGREEMENT that Lowe's owned that information and that they would be hired for the installation, he just let us walk away, angry and abused and insulted and frustrated and just thoroughly mind-raped by him and Lowe's. 

We ended up going to Customer Service again, talking to the same lady, and my sister told her what happened and that she wants her money back and that she is going to cancel her members /credit card if she's going to be treated this way. That lady called that same manager up and he gave my sister a refund. 

But, here we are, with someone to do the floor and windows and no one to do such things as drywall, spackling, installing cabinets. And, I don't know where we are going to get our materials, now, because, I found a rather expensive sink for the best price at Lowe's, and a great faucet, and the exact right color of cabinets for the wall color I want. We had tiles for the backsplash near to being decided on. All from Lowe's.  But, that manager, by lying to us, crapped several thousand dollars down the drain, plus the money that we would have paid an installer who was willing to do the work 

All because no one would just sit down with us and help us plan the kitchen, walk us through the process and tell us what we might need to hire someone else to do - like if Lowe's installers never do drywall - before we could put the  rest of the plan into action.

I recently started working right done the street from Thai Lotus find myself ordering lunch out pretty often. It's been a great opportunity to eat at some restaurants that feel out of the way when I'm at home. 

This week I was in the mood for noodles and didn't want the easy choice (rhymes with Fanda Impress) so I did a quick search for Thai food to get my go-to dish: Pad See Ew with Beef and some Sticky Rice. Of course it was one of the few things not offered as a lunch special but I figured I could get 2 meals out of the dinner portion. 

I called in my order and was told 15-20 minutes. It was ready when I walked in 20 minutes later. They have a bunch of tables pushed together as soon as you walk in which acts as a staging area for takeout orders as well as provides a great way to social distance between staff and guests picking up. They had 2 cups for pens - one marked clean and one marked used. The clean ones were poked through a lid so you could grab one without touching the others. I appreciated the thought they put into trying to keep their guests safe!

My food was still piping hot when I got it back to work. I like that they don't use styrofoam for packaging. I ate half of the Pad See Ew and half of the sticky rice and I was more than content. I popped the leftover sticky rice in the container with the noodles and popped it in the fridge for later. The microwave safe packaging made it so easy to reheat at work a couple of days after.

I have never felt so disrespected and unwelcome as a PAYING customer at any establishment in my life. I came here to celebrate a 22nd birthday with 3 friends at 11am on a Saturday. We are all pre-service teachers who have school 8-4 Monday-Friday and wanted to celebrate with one mimosa with our brunch. Upon arrival, Andrew, the security guard, ran up to us and rudely checked our IDs. He was mean, disrespectful and spoke down to us, as if we were trying to pull a fast one on him, which we were not. I am of legal age to drink and should not be treated as a criminal as soon as I enter a restaurant.  After telling us we could not order drinks there because our designated driver was underage he became extremely aggressive and basically decided we could not be seated, even for breakfast. We explained the situation; our driver was not planning on drinking, we are trying to celebrate a birthday with breakfast. We asked to speak to a manager, at which point a hostess, who clearly felt bad for us, offered us to sit down in the waiting area. Andrew told us we were not allowed to sit down. The manager came over, was also rude but listened to what we were saying and eventually allowed us to sit inside ""where he could watch us"". The entire staff then gossiped and stared at us for 10 minutes before coming over to greet us and offer us water. The waitress had clearly been informed and treated us as children. The saga with Andrew did not stop, as he wandered around the restaurant checking the IDs of seated, eating customers. We watched him interrupt a couple- mid 50s, clearly of age- to check their ID with a light. Absolutely ridiculous. He came back to check our stamps as we were about to leave and as one of us had washed the stamp off in the bathroom after it stained her white pants, Andrew had to recheck her ID with suspicion. I would understand this behavior at a club at midnight, but this was absolutely absurd for a daytime restaurant. I would also understand if we looked like a suspicious group trying to get hammered, but we were a group of student teachers who NEVER go out. We giggled at the ""Support Teachers"" sign near the door on our way out. I won't be returning and will encourage everyone I talk to not to waste their time at a restaurant that is MEAN to their customers.",2021-01-31 07:20:12,497,2429,

See that smear of peanut butter or snickers bars inside the cup? She GASLIGHTED ME at the drive through speaker when I came back, livid, to inform her I am EXTREMELY allergic to peanuts, by denying (with ATTITUDE if you can believe that) me she screwed up BIG TIME with a GOB of peanuts in my SNICKERDOODLE BLIZZARD. I went to the window to show her and she then said that snickers are the base for the blizzard and they always have peanuts in there! Try again, girl. I've had this blizzard religiously fir the last month and never had a problem and DQ wouldn't sneak peanuts in a blizzard without alerting on the menu. The red head argued with me as if i was a peer and not a customer. She is very disrespectful and this isn't the first time I have noticed that. She slammed the window in my face because she couldn't take responsibility for her careless mistake!  Here I am at my doctors office on Emerald immediately after leaving Dq (luckily I already was headed to for an appointment. )They administered not one, but TWO epi pens in my thigh.  that is coming out of MY deductible and they were extremely painful. I will be notifying Corporate about this. The CUSTOMER needs to be treated with respect the customer should not have to say be the one saying thank you, hello, and  have a good day. The employees here don't do anything but take your money and treat you like you're interrupting their socializing with coworkers. And by the way, I called to speak with the manager and the red head said she was the manager. I would like the real manager to get in contact with me ASAP or I will call corporate. What happened today was unacceptable. The carelessness, NASTY service, and ARGUING WITH ME instead of apologizing, and abandoning me at the window is a new low I have never witnessed at any establishment.  I love DQ, but avoid this one until they get new management. If it wasn't for me on my way to the dr appt. I would have gone into ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK and been unable to breathe.

Two of my friends from South Florida were up in this neck of the woods, and asked if I wanted to meet up with them at Edison, which is one of their favorite restaurants in Tampa.

We decided to order some of their cocktails and split a few appetizers before each getting our own entree. While I don't remember what they ordered, I chose the ""tipsy flamingo"" which was made with vodka, blueberry, mint, cardamom bitters and brut rose. It was good but a bit strong so I sipped on it throughout the meal.

We started with the burrata, which came with heirloom tomatoes, charred shishito peppers, a yummy pepita pesto and a small scoop of chipotle lime sorbet, which was refreshing with a bit of a kick but wasn't too spicy.

Next, we shared the short rib and pumpkin risotto, which had a good amount of meat along with manchego cheese, pepper jelly, toasted pecan, a stuffed squash blossom and creme fraiche. If we hadn't ordered this as an app, I was going to choose this as my meal -- and I wouldn't have been disappointed. It was delicious!

I opted to order the dijon adobo chicken as my entree, which came with the softest parmesan gnocchi, green peppercorn jus, summer peas and an herb foam. The chicken was good and I liked the peppercorn sauce, but the clear star of the show here was that pillowy gnocchi.

For dessert, I ordered the acorn fluff puff, and I had NO idea what it was going to taste like. It came with an acorn almond cake as its base, along with a praline anglaise and a vanilla bean marshmallowy fluff on top. It came with a small scoop of carob ice cream on the side along with a cherry sauce adorning the plate. This was SO good.

We really enjoyed everything we ordered, and our server was responsive and helpful. But this was definitely not a cheap meal... it ended up costing us about $80 per person. I will absolutely come back here, but likely only for special occasions.",2021-01-04 17:54:33,414,1974,

I looked in my Yelp collection (bookmarks) and for some reason, I saved Paleo Soul as a place to try.  I researched where it is located and the menu.  By the way, it is in front of Sam's Club on 96th St. in Indy with the only parking lot entry west of Tire Discounters.  Paleo Soul is closed a few days out of the week.  They use Facebook to inform before opening at noon about the specials (until 2 pm) and menu of the day.  I would suggest you call ahead to see if any items are sold out and be prepared to wait up to 30 minutes.

As another person has Yelped, the pleasant smell of the paleo sweet potato hit me as I opened the takeout container.  I could not tell how they made the sweet potato paleo but it tasted normal.

I ordered the lightly herb seasoned turkey leg, which I was asked if I wanted gravy (on the side please - oh, it looked a little oily but I used it all on the tender meat).

Although Pepsi decor is on their wall, they do not carry Pepsi products but Faygo canned sodas.  Also, they ran out of my requested grape soda so I got an orange one.

The entree + side + drink for $10.99 surprisingly included a dinner roll.

So, now I purchased my 1st paleo (P designation on their menu board) side.  I plan to go back and try other entrees with a side and drink (and maybe a dinner roll, hehe).  The turkey chop, spicy chicken wings, etc. are drawing me back.

FYI.  The restaurant makes other food that are not paleo.  I wish they have more options of paleo.",2021-01-24 21:39:33,349,1575,

I read such good reviews on this place but my experience was something less than bad.  We are a property owners and just as a precaution when we get a new tenant I usually replace the key with a quickset key.  The last time I did this, I somehow got my main key which is supposed to stay in the key box, mixed up with the would be tenant's.  

In my confusion I noticed that the key did not have Do Not Duplicate on it, so I got out my stamp and ping! problem solved.  Except my wife asked me later where the ""master"" or main key was.  To which I showed her but it was also a Do Not Duplicate.   So I now had to rectify this by going down and getting another made.  So I went to Minors and asked the key maker there what to do.  He told me to ""You need to go to a locksmith, like Tri-County and have them do it.  They may ask you for proof of ownership or something.""

Today I called them and explained my situation to a gentlemen who seemed quite excited and willing to spend a minute explaining the difference between an actual master key and a regular Do not Duplicate.  So realizing quickly that I had committed a vernacular no no, that only a muggle could make, within the magical kingdom of Key World, I let him explain it all to me.  

Once we had ended the lesson I asked if they could make me the key and I clearly stated, that I needed a main key that did NOT have the ""Do Not Duplicate"" stamped on it. and I asked if I needed any documentation.  He said no, just come down and he would take care of it.  I was so happy!  Wow this guy did talk alot but he was being really cool.

Once at the location I stood waiting for the guy behind the counter to finish his story.  He seemed to be talking to a friend who was waiting to leave, so I waited.  and waited.  Until finally I pulled out my phone to get a clip of story.  I do not know if my phone picked it up but it I think i got another minute before I heard him say ""okay that will be...""  This was a customer that the guy was literally holding hostage with the purchase so he could tell his story.  I realized this was probably the guy I talked to on the phone.

Just then another gentlemen entered and asked if I needed help.  I came forth and said I called and was told to come in, and I explained my situation, to which he said, ""sorry I cant do that.""  pointing to the ""Do Not Duplicate"" on the key.

I was now getting a little frustrated.  "" I spoke to someone on the phone, explained in detail my issues and they told me to come down.  Now you say you cant?""  He looked at the other, handed me the key and walked back into his office.  The other customer had by this time left and the other guy asked how he could help.  I revisited the conversation on the phone and he took the key and made duplicate.  

Before handing the key back he started explaining that ""keys have a code that you should really learn.... this one is a six..."" I just nodded and thanked him and put my Do Not Duplicate key back on the key ring.  While handing the gentlemen the credit card.  It was at this time I picked up the New duplicate main key.  My relief was short lived because, as I turned it over it read. ""Do Not Duplicate.""

I handed it back to him and said, and showed him that the key he chose as the main key was the wrong one.  He insisted that he was not allowed to do it any other way.  I said that is not what I need nor what I asked for.  He said ""that is what we do.""   To which I placed the key on the counter and stated that I do not want the key.  The gentlemen grew angry and walked away exclaiming ""This is the last time I do someone a favor!""   I left.

I went home dialed a locksmith in Santa Barbara and they said I could come in with proof of ownership and a valid ID and they would make a new original house Key. I gave myself 90 minutes to calm down before writing this review.  I would like to chalk this down as really poor customer service.  poor representation of a business.  By the reaction of his coworker I have a feeling this guy does lots of ""favors.""  Only it backfired this time because I was not asking for favors.  Time for a beer!  Sorry for misspells or word crimes.  I did not edit.

BTW for readers out there who are into drinking games:  Print this story and every time you read the words ""Do Not Duplicate""  DRINK!",2021-01-16 00:20:02,955,4327,

It took over 3 weeks to get my car repaired which I felt was a long time. Mind you they did a fantastic job on the body work. It looks amazing and you'd never know there was any damage but not so much on the undercarriage. The car was given back to me still with a broken or bad CV joint or joints caused by the accident when I picked the car up on a Saturday morning.  After a few minutes I immediately realized there was something not right. It was a Saturday so they just closed after I picked the car up  so I called them on Monday. I was told to bring it back in and the guy who usually answers the phone was there and he test drove it and had his employee drive it too and they both said it was fine. I left but was still not convinced. I called back later that day and I was told if you want you can bring in to the place that balanced the wheels. I brought it to them and after a quick drive they immediately said what I already knew from a second opinion of a friend & he recommended both CV joints be replaced. I once again got back on the phone to the main guy at Manhattan Collision and he said bring it in but at first they wanted to charge me until I spoke with the insurance adjuster and then they both agreed to replace only the passengers side CV joint. Once again I brought the car back in and 3 days later they had it ready. This problem should have been discovered from the start and I am annoyed they would give me back a car saying it's ready and in fact it's not fully road worthy. If a CV joint breaks while you're driving it can be deadly dangerous. They do amazing body work but if you are looking for anything to do you with the suspension or undercarriage maybe they are not the people to use.,2021-01-27 11:22:43,381,1809,

I was super hungry and had ordered over the phone an 18"" 4 cheese pizza with mushrooms and an 18"" Philly Cheesesteak Pizza without green peppers (my partner absolutely can't stand the taste of green peppers, which is a shame in itself ). When I got there 20 min later, my pizzas weren't ready but it was only a 5 min wait to get them. Unfortunately, they forgot to remove the green peppers and I had found out after almost driving out the parking lot. Unfortunately, I had to wait, what felt like another 20 min to get it. I admit I was hangry and every minute felt like an eternity . The guys were nice and tried to offer me a free soda but we don't drink soda and I thought that was a bit of a half hearted way to make up for the extra time lost and my other pizza getting cold. The pizzas smell was absolutely divine in the car though!

Price: these were pretty expensive pizzas, about $30 each with taxes. I did get specialty pizzas but I was still taken aback at just 2 extra large pizzas totaling to $60.

4 cheese Pizza with mushrooms- this was absolutely delicious. The mushrooms were a nice, thin and slightly crispy texture. The sauce was sweeter but not acidic. 5/5

Philly Cheesesteak Pizza without green peppers- this was another great pizza! The steak bits were so nice and slightly crispy on the edges. The caramelized onions added a nice sweetness and the provolone gave it great texture with the mozzarella. 5/5",2021-01-11 06:39:30,323,1568,

First I always call in advance and I'm told rolls will take either 10-25 mins cool I'm alright with that but !! I've waited almost an hour before for a simple roll it's simply inexcusable . Sometimes I may get me roll in 10-15 mins but it's a hit or miss here. Than the service gosh , there's this lady who is so unfriendly that I cannot help but feel like she resents me for some odd reason. I always order pickup and they have no dine in options except for outdoor seating , they have these little white ringers that notifies the staff someone is outside. The staff is in and out a lot obviously but today I picked up and greeted her when she came out telling her I'm picking up and she says I know and walks right inside . No estimate on time no hello back , a couple people were contemplating eating there but after seeing how rude she was they left , it was kind of funny because they laughed at how she brushed me off so nonchalantly . So at this point I'm just thinking wow she has been so unfriendly to me so many times and this time she definitely showed me she dislikes me lol. I want to ask her about my rolls because I waited an extra 15 minutes past the estimated prep time. It took me to call the restaurant to ask whether my roll is ready since she clearly didn't want to serve me , disgusting behavior and lack of respect for my time. At this point she seems annoyed with me asking if I called and I told her yes and she then says your roll is ready and makes me wait another 5 minutes to bring it out . Honestly the value is awesome here and the sushi is pretty good but she needs to go . Hopefully sake house can get more sushi chefs because I'm assuming wait time is usually do to a large influx of orders and lack of sufficient staffing . I think I'm being generous with 3 stars I may or may not eat here again. Then again 5 dollar sushi is pretty tempting haha",2021-01-12 03:17:41,429,2041,

The last 20 times I've come in over the past few years, the staff have been passively rude which makes it unpleasant. The selection is overpriced, so I've only shopped the big discount boxes.

Today I pulled out three $2.99 bundles of 3 comics each. One had a Buffy comic up front, the other two had Star Trek.

They were taped SHUT, so I just assumed that the other two comics inside each one would be the same publication as the front-facing comic. When I got home and opened them up, ALL THREE had the exact same comics inside behind the front-facing comic and in each case it was a Transformers and a Thundercats comic, totally unrelated to the one facing outwardly.

If you value these at a dollar apiece, I wasted $6 and that's not the end of the world, but it just seems like a shady way to make a quick buck.

I did reach out via Facebook and I got a response that didn't apologize so much for the practice but said, I'm quoting, ""Sorry you had a bad reaction."" Well, how would you expect me to react?

I was offered a refund but it's not worth going back in and at the end of the day I guess I just paid $3 each for the $1 comics I did actually want, but I won't be coming back ever again.

We arrived and spent a few minutes at the bar warming up, then we were sat at a table where there wasn't any social distancing in a room with other empty tables available further apart. 

The server showed up to take our drink order, which I had previously preselected a few bottles of wines from, this process took over a half an hour that morning because of their very long list. It turned out that they did not have any of my options, so he brought us 4 samples to see if we liked any. The wines were just below average, the best one being ""Duckhorn Cabernet"" and all were around 75°F. Of course we didn't like any! So, the sommelier came by, we expressed our displeasure of not being able to get the wines that we previously selected from their up to date wine list online and about serving us warm wine samples. She said that they keep all wines served by the glass at ""room temperature"". After she suggested either 2011 Gemstone Red or 2005 Penfolds Cabernet/Shiraz Cellar Reserve, the first option I declined because the 2011 in Napa was a deficient vintage in particular for the Valley Floor wines, so I picked the Penfolds. She opened and placed it in a very small decanter with not enough room for a quick aeration...

Moving on to the food (because I could go on and on talking about wine) my friend ordered the T-Bone 15oz, I got the Châteaubriand 14oz and the girls went with the filet mignon. My steak was nicely cooked and I enjoyed it but my friends was overcooked and a bit dry, he was not too happy but did not sent it back, he just ate it, the ladies were satisfied but not impressed.

As you can imagine we did not end up happy, none of my 5 preselected wines were available, warm wine samples, no compensation for the inconvenience or displeasure was offered.

Then we drank a good wine within minutes that should have been decanted for at least one hour or at least decanted in a nice size decanter. After finishing an okay round of steaks with no acknowledgement of my friend's birthday despite alerting the server upon arrival...

We have been to all others at the Village in Meridian and wanted to try this place. Admittedly, we had high expectations as we do with every time we decide to spend money going out to eat. We arrived late afternoon on Sunday. We found a table when we arrived and sat down. Service was quick. However, we were immediately approached with items they were out of. She told us in the first seconds that they were out of 2 items. I was put off as this is simply poor management to allow a restaurant to run out of product. This could be a precursor to other poor management with this restaurant. We soon picked out items to order when the server then informed us they were out of mozzarella sticks. So now this is 3 items on their menu that they do not have. With a total of maybe 20 menu items, this is 15 percent that they do not have! We came extremely close to leaving at that point but we decided to stay as we had wine. The server could care less. She was so used to being out of items, she went through the spiel like she knew exactly what to say. There was no excuse given for being out of these items. As a side note, being out of product reduces sales. We wanted one item as an appetizer and we ended up not ordering anything as they were out of what we wanted. 

The food arrived and were extremely small portions. Barely 2 ounces of chicken with the pasta. The food was good overall, just very small. That also makes them overpriced. I think the pasta with chicken was about $15. Generally not bad, but with small portions, it is a little expensive. 

Also, important to note that the menu online for this location is completely different from the menu in the restaurant. This is important to us as we use online menus to determine if we want to eat at a particular restaurant. There are many choices to dine out. This place does not do a great job overall. I have noticed with other reviews that there is a manager that will respond to great comments but does not provide any response to poor reviews. Another sign of poor management.

I ordered two different burgers, onion rings, and a slaw for carry out.  My husband went and picked it up. Once I opened the first bag I found three orders of onion rings and an order of fries......then the other bag had four sandwiches(none of which we ordered). Turns out they gave us the wrong order.  After calling many many many times, my husband headed back in that direction. After my 21th call, they answered and when I started to explain what happened, they knew who we were. They told us they had our actual order and to just keep the wrong bag. 

My husband came home w our actual order.....it was also wrong. It had three burgers(none of which we actually ordered) and the slaw. Good thing we had order #1s onion rings.  The bag did have our ticket and name on it this time but still completely wrong. 

So because of the errors, our food had been sitting there for almost an hour. It was never remade. The food was cold.  Two of the burgers were wet and falling apart. Ontop of that they had to be reheated bc they had been sitting there. 

Overall for service : 1
Tips : Don't go at peak time. They were VERY busy. Also, check your order before you leave including the unwrapping of your sandwich. 

Now the good stuff. 

Although we didn't get what we ordered, everything tasted great.  I reheated everything in the air fryer (you should totally get one if you don't own one).  The onion rings were phenomenal. They are different than the typical onion rings you see everywhere. This was very similar to those Bloomin Onions but in an onion ring form. The dipping sauces were excellent as well. 

Since we also had that other bag of food, we also got to try the fries. Loved them! 

The burger my husband has was not what he ordered and he wasn't impressed with it. He thought it was too plain. However, I think it was just made wrong. The burger I had was not what I ordered but had great flavor. The grilled onions made the bun very wet so keep that in mind if you're getting ""to go"". 

We also have a chicken sandwich and cod to try today and both looked tasty. 

Overall Food : 5.

The missing fifth star is solely due to operations in the middle of this Covid mess. 

Ours was an early reservation- 6:00. Figured we would have a better shot at avoiding a crowd. We were partly correct. Upon entering, the lobby, bar and waiting area were packed. Six feet more like 12 inches. Masks were ""required"" in the public areas and staff (for the most part) properly wore masks. We chose to step back out into the parking lot to await our table. 

We were seated in the Bordeaux Room, the original storefront that gave birth to this institution. The red velvet and classic decor is part of the charm. 

We were fairly well apart to start, but at 7:30 the table sizes grew and we wound up surrounded. In addition, the older waiter in the room, would pull down his mask to talk to the customers, in addition to allowing his nose full freedom. We actually complained about this. The dining room that leads to the restrooms was basically packed - like a Covid gauntlet. 

Hence the missing star. We won't be going back until this passes.

Setting aside the environment, the rest of the meal was excellent, and the service, stellar. Paul, our server was a gem, and the sommelier,Jamie, led us on an amazing wine journey! 

Your meal - if you order an entree - at Bern's includes the classic French Onion Soup, a large salad with your choice of dressing , a loaded baked potato and the vegetable of the day. So keep that in mind if you fill up easily!

We started with the aged Chateaubriand carpaccio- - which was spectacular! Moving on to entrees, we all ordered beef dishes - filet mignon, 100 day dry-aged Delmonico (rib eye),, and a Luxe Beef Tasting that includes a 3oz Japanese Wagyu in addition to the filet and dry-aged rib eye. I'd stick with the individual cuts and skip the Wagyu.

The wines were lovingly curated by Jamie and were the highlight of the evening. If you treat the food as a complement to your wine dinner you'll do just fine here! 

The tours are currently not offered, but the upstairs Dessert Room is open and you are Invited to head there after dinner for dessert (if you have room) and after dinner drinks.

Shame on you for not being honest and me having to find it by checking to make sure everything is done every single cleaning! Why have a company clean when you have to babysit every time. Not only that, I have requested a Manager (Leslie) to come out and visit my home because I was constantly paying beyond the 2 hours because once again I had another crew.. What? On my dime.. oh, it's because they have such a high turn around they are constantly training and no one can ever get use to a home.. this causes inconsistency in my needs of cleaning! If I have the same crew every time then maybe they would know exactly what to do! Omg.. they are living in the Stone Age with their payment system and charge more for cc.. Overall I am so dissatisfied and do not appreciate being called a liar every time I call about a redo cause they missed something! Here is a video of my last cleaning yesterday 1/25/21 the lady's are back today 1/26/12 because they did NOT clean window seals, cabinets, areas of baseboards and all vents in the home! Don't waste your time or money you will thank me! I've been given a great recommendation and I'm very excited for a full service clean.

Fun fact: this is the first Syberg in St. Louis and it is run by the daughter of the original owner. 

Win dip: $5 during happy hour, get it!

Pizza rolls: also $5 during happy hour, honestly, pass and get something else. It was just ok. 

Chicken wrap: $10.95 the chicken inside was perfectly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Comes with their signature sauce which is basically a Buffalo sauce. I'm warning you it's pretty acidic, I got it on the side and I'm glad I did because I am not a fan. But my friend loves their sauce so I'll let you be the judge. Overall though, the wrap had too much tortilla, which my issue with wraps all over the world so that's not Syberg's fault. 

Chicken philly: $8.95 or $9.95 flavor was good but my friend thought it might have sat under the warmer too long because the cheese over over melted. From where I sat it also looked a little dry to the naked eye. 

Ice cream and cookie thingy: the ice cream and the whipped cream was great but our cookie was really burnt. We told Jessi that it was but was informed that because the cookie is baked in the same oven as their pizzas there's not much that can be done. Because it will come out the same. They were also pretty busy by the time we got dessert so since we are not Karens we just ate it anyway, there was enough ice cream to kinda cover up the burnt taste lol.

They do have great happy hour specials even on fridays so it's worth checking out! Downstairs bar area though, other than the employees, not a mask in sight and no social distancing. I'd recommend sitting upstairs or just further back in the dining area.",2021-01-24 16:06:22,387,1779,

First I'd like to state that our waitress did amazing and was tipped well for her attention to detail, kindness and prompt service. My meal was first delivered so burnt it wasn't edible. The waitress was so kind and immediately took my plate and placed a new order. 45 minutes later (after the rest of our party had finished their meals) my order was brought to the table. The manager stood by to make sure my steak was cooked appropriately, ignoring that my ribs were so black that charcoal was falling off the bone rather than meat. I said it was fine because, we had somewhere else to be and couldn't wait another 45 minutes for my meal. The second go around my steak was raw...literally seared on each side and cold in the middle (I ordered a medium rare ribeye). I boxed up my meal with plans to cook on my own grill at home. As we left the restaurant, I spoke to Jesse (the manager) and let him know that we are frequent patrons and that I didn't expect a free meal but did want them to know that it was the worst meal I had ever had at that establishment, my steak was burnt the first time, raw the second- ribs were burnt all the way through both times.

I had built up the courage to set sail on my return voyage. The weather was perfect, brisk January morning. The kind of day with just enough breeze that might catch your breath for a second. Sunlight was warm, dancing and brightly flashing along the trees as I sped along. My car seat was cold, my steering wheel was icy, ""Everything will be better after I see her again,"" I thought, running my fingers along my leather armrest.

She is a gift to mankind as great as fire. I still remember my first time. I had heard rumors of a great reward awaiting those who would travel just to experience it. Hobbyists, journeymen and women, coming from afar and sometimes even just down the block. They all came for one thing. Minutes turn into hours, weeks into months, Months into years after last seeing her. Oh yes, I was ready. 

I could still see her, in all her curvaceous glory. Steaming hot... sexy, meaty and succulent. I can still remember her taste. Slippery wetness full of smooth desire and lustful enjoyment. I can still recall the tickling trickle of delicious juice after going in, the trickle flowing down my chin. I didn't come here to wipe my chin. ""I don't wipe chins,"" I said to myself.

One thing that recently caught my eye was the screener at the front entrance to the clinic.  According to the rules governing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), the following is the rule of law. 

""The Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information (""Privacy Rule"") establishes, for the first time, a set of national standards for the protection of certain health information. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (""HHS"") issued the Privacy Rule to implement the requirement of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (""HIPAA"").1 The Privacy Rule standards address the use and disclosure of individuals' health information--called ""protected health information"" by organizations subject to the Privacy Rule -- called ""covered entities,"" as well as standards for individuals' privacy rights to understand and control how their health information is used. Within HHS, the Office for Civil Rights (""OCR"") has responsibility for implementing and enforcing the Privacy Rule with respect to voluntary compliance activities and civil money penalties.

A major goal of the Privacy Rule is to assure that individuals' health information is properly protected while allowing the flow of health information needed to provide and promote high quality health care and to protect the public's health and well being. The Rule strikes a balance that permits important uses of information, while protecting the privacy of people who seek care and healing. Given that the health care marketplace is diverse, the Rule is designed to be flexible and comprehensive to cover the variety of uses and disclosures that need to be addressed.

This is a summary of key elements of the Privacy Rule and not a complete or comprehensive guide to compliance. Entities regulated by the Rule are obligated to comply with all of its applicable requirements and should not rely on this summary as a source of legal information or advice. To make it easier for entities to review the complete requirements of the Rule, provisions of the Rule referenced in this summary are cited in the end notes. Visit our Privacy Rule section to view the entire Rule, and for other additional helpful information about how the Rule applies. In the event of a conflict between this summary and the Rule, the Rule governs."" 

Here is the HHS.gov web site link for the entire HIPAA laws language.   https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/laws-regulations/index.html

I re-posted the above excerpt from the HHS web site because when all veterans stop at the entrance their forehead temperature is taken by the person at the desk. They then give a very public medical decision of your health status in front of all other veterans and spouses and sometimes vendors waiting to enter and standing in line not including all veterans sitting  nearby who can hear this.  If you show a higher than normal temp, they (and all other greeters) then very publicly make an on the spot medical decision that you are unhealthy, contagious and refuses you entrance for your appointment and in front of everyone standing in line. This can be an extremely embarassing and humiliating experience and for those veterans with PTSD or anxiety, this can elevate their symptoms.

#1.  The greeter most of the time sits in his chair and asks the veteran to lean into him (Bowing) in order to take your skin temp. He does not know if veterans have balance issues, back problems, in your bubble closeness issues or any other medical problem that may be exacerbated by leaning forward when all he needs to do is get off his lazy A$$ and stand up.

#2.  These screener's then ask you for private medical information in front of other veterans, spouses, people coming and going and vendors standing in line.  They ask ""why are you here today"" when that is neither his business or anyone else standing in line. This is a violation of HIPAA laws governing the collection of and dissemination of ""private medical information.""

I've asked these greeters at other VA facilities why they ask for private information and have been told that ""they can then better determine which area you need to go to."" Just about every veteran I know around the country that uses a VA facility knows where they are going and does not need to be told by a greeter. If they do, they just ask for directions. All VA facilities need to cease and desist in this very public ""gathering of"" and ""dissemination of"", private medical information and especially to those who have no medical or professional reason for asking for it.

VA Hospital leadership needs to re-think their policies and make changes that will ensure a higher degree of privacy for all people who enter a VA facility.

I was rather upset I didn't get the right order at all last time but said nothing because we made it all the way home to an inaccurate order and it was too late, and I didn't want to complain because someone else took me out to lunch and I was there for the company not the food. I am not a chronic complainer, I try to give people the benefit of the doubt. 

I gave them another chance in good faith and they Disappointed us again. Wow. This is not typical of Subways, they are usually accurate to the max at most locations, and healthier in general as far as fast food goes. 

I just wanted the meats and vegetables, no bread nor a bunch of fattening stuff, it wasn't a special order. 

What if I had a food allergy? Would it then be okay to leave out what I asked for, and pile on something I don't want, need, or can't eat?

Thankfully I don't, and I'm not that picky of a person, but I am on a very strict special diet now and if I paid close to $10 for something I expect to get what I paid for, not a ton of random packets thrown in the bag when I did not ask for those items, and it would taste terrible on the kind of food I purchased. 

Please, Subway manager, check in with your employees once in a while and see if they truly are listening to the customers. 

I asked for a particular dressing that is diet-friendly; they just weren't paying attention and again, we didn't notice until we left. 

I tried to call the manager to be nice and ask if it was maybe new worker, but they do not answer their listed phone number. 

I will not be back and will continue to wait to get to home to eat. I don't want to pay close to $10 for a few items slapped in a bowl.

I may try a different locale, as I have always gone to subways in several states and they are always good. I hope that this is not an indication of how this particular subway is run, but I see that they have a low rating in general so hopefully they will improve in the future for other customers.",2021-01-29 18:35:55,453,2036,

We finally made it to Eddie & Sam's for one of their famous NY style pies. The line wasn't too bad, as we came around 2:30. I ordered a large pepperoni, mushroom, onion and jalapeño pizza, as well as chicken parm and an eggplant parm slices, a cheesecake slice and meatballs.  (I also ordered garlic knots and asked about cannolis. They had neither as they're running a limited menu for now). I asked for the slices not to be toasted, when I ordered them. However, by the time I got to the cash register, the slices were coming out of the conveyor belt.  No big deal I told her. (I didn't want the slices to go to waste). I paid. Pizza was ready. I took it and left. We were only a few blocks away at a red light.  It smelled so delicious I had to see it. When I opened the pizza box I saw there was no pepperoni on it. We turned around and drove back.  They fixed the pizza by just throwing pepperoni on top, which I told them was fine, because again, I didn't want food to go to waste. It wasn't until we were halfway home that I noticed they didn't give me the meatballs. I was on the phone with them for about 10-12 minutes while they tried to figure out how to credit my card for the meatball charge.  Finally I asked if they could just call me back when they figured it out. They called 10 minutes later saying they had to delete the whole transaction and then rerun the card for the new amount. The credit back to my CC for the deleted charge wouldn't appear for 3-5 days. Fine. Okay. When we finally got home and had a chance to enjoy the pizza, I felt like I needed a drink from how hectic the whole process was. Ordering food to go shouldn't be stressful. Hopefully, it was just a fluke. We thoroughly enjoyed the pizza and the staff was helpful, just not organized.

I moved to the area almost 4 yrs ago. A neighbor recommended the dentist here and at the time he was really good. But... he left almost a year later and since then I have seen 4 other dentists! Not one stays long enough! Except for Dr. V (which did not last long unfortunately) and the one way at the beginning, the rest I hate to say this, they suck! 

Why I am writing this review? Funny that I had never looked at reviews for this place, but honestly, I have to agree with all the other reviews regarding how horrible this place is! 

As most patients, due to Covid last year I avoided doctor's offices as much as I could! Dental office was a bit no-no for me, especially since they had said that only emergencies and then I had read that they were recommending not to go unless you really needed to. And that is exactly what I did! Unfortunately, one of my crowns popped out and when I called, Dr. V was already gone so two new ones were there. May I say, I was freaking out during the whole appointment! He kept readjusting his face mask every 5 minutes! OMG!!! The office usually gives you a proposed treatment plan, which I thought was a bit high as this had happened before and I had not paid that much for this, but it had to be done. If I would have known how scary the whole experience throughout the appointment was going to be, trust me, I would have found myself a different place to go to. Heck! I would've driven 4 hours to see my old dentist! 

In December I called my dental plan to ask a question about the new benefits and since I had them on the phone I asked why the stopped covering this procedure. The lady was completely confused as she said they did and I should have paid much less! When I called the office, I spoke with Jennifer, who said ""oh, you have a credit"". Why did they new administration at this office decided to start overcharging, is beyond me, but to keep the money and not even have the decency to reach out and send me the money back, that is disgusting! She said that they did not make refunds, they just leave credit on the account. OH NO SHE DID NOT SAY THAT! I basically threw a fit (not really, but did demand my money back!). According to her they would make an exception and refund my money but it would take 6 to 8 weeks! Are you kidding me?! They take my money by overcharging and they keep it making extra getting interests off to it, and I have to wait 6 to 8 weeks? No way!!!! After I don't know how long, she ended up saying that they had agreed to push a rush on this refund. 

That was 4 weeks ago. I have been trying to reach someone at the office, unsuccessfully. It goes directly to young kids that just schedule appointments and take messages, which are NOT RETURNED! Don't even try reaching out to the Coast Dental corporate office and their so called Patient Relations! That is such a joke! That name is so ironic for a department! I left two messages last week and I still haven't heard back. Oh! I have been trying to all today, to reach the Largo office, keep getting the same kids, I assume they are young, at least they do sound young; I have tried the corporate office and all the different departments, hoping someone will pick up and GUESS WHAT???? Every single department, even the operator(!!!!!) ends up going to their voicemail system.

Walked in and no one was at the hostess stand. There was only one table occupied inside. After about a minute or two, the bartender walked up while shaking up a drink in each hand. I wish I remembered her name, be she was the best thing about our time there. She was super pleasant and told by she cold get us seated. We chose to sit outdoors where there was one couple seated. 
She left and came back with some waters. We opted to order a a couple of Tequila Palomas at her suggestion. They were good. We ordered she Crawfish Croquettes and Roasted Cauliflower Muhammara to start. We were puzzled by why it was taking so long when we were practically the only people there. The couple that was seated was already eating and there was still only one table inside when I went in to the restroom. She stopped by to check in and we added the cheese board to our order.
To be expected, that came out quickly. It was quite underwhelming aside from the blueberry jam that was smeared on the plate      We ended up asking for more jam and literally dipped everything in it bc the food was so unbearable. The crawfish croquettes were over fried and soggy. The cauliflower was weird tasting, but had the perfect crunch. I didn't enjoy the Muhammara at all. It should be noted that I've never had it before. So Idk if it was quality or preference. The food took way too long to say there were only two table occupying the whole restaurant while once our order was in. We never saw any other employee aside from the bartender the entire time.

By the time the salad came out everyone was done eating the bill was paid and the drinks were empty and we were ready to go but still waiting on this salad (we reminded 2 different waiters about the salad in between all that time) They came out with a large salad which was nice of them cause they knew how long we had waited.

First, when we arrived, we had to seek out a very disinterested appearing host.  He informed us that because it was 8:00 and seating for all guests wasn't until 8:15 we would have to wait in the cold outside with another group of diners.  We obliged and stood in front of the door staring at the empty but heated yurts we would soon be dining in.  Why exactly did we have to wait in the cold instead of inside the yurts?  As we waited, two other parties arrived around 8:10 and checked in and were seated in their yurts.  We went to ask about seating but the host was too busy seating the other tables that arrived after us, when he got back he finally seated us around 8:20.

Next up, beverages.  We were asked if we preferred sparkling or still and said still, assuming that this must be house sparkling water if we weren't offered the option of tap water.  Nope, we were presented with a $15 bottle of aqua panna.  Ok, no biggie, didn't even mention it, but it sets a certain tone.  After we finished it the server asked if we'd like another and we asked for tap water, there was a looong pause and he finally said in an audibly deflated tone ""we can bring you that"".   Next the ridiculous alcohol policy, we were told that we could only order bottles of wine with dinner (about $100 price point) bc of covid.  I'm unclear how other bars and restaurants in town are able to serve glasses, but apparently Hiroki can't pull it off safely.  My wife asked to try one of the white wines before we bought a $150 bottle, we were informed that this was not possible because of covid.  Really??  Fine, we'll take it.  The server brought out the bottle and proceeded to pop the cork and pour a sip for my wife in the sommelier style for her approval, in my head ae voice screamed WHY ARE YOU PUTTING ON THE SHOW IF YOU CLEARLY DONT CARE IF THE BOTTLE IS TO HER LIKING ANYWAY!!?  You might as well just hand us the bottle and walk away.  We've dined at many ultra high end restaurants, French Laundry, Vetri, Blue Hill at Stone Barns, etc, none of those places would bat an eye if you asked for tap water or wanted to taste a wine.  Hell if you were at Vetri and you told the server you want grape Fanta they'd probably run out and buy you some. 

Dinner was excellent.   food was gorgeous and artfully prepared.  We enjoyed most aspects of our meal with very few exceptions.  Really no complaints here.

After the meal the server brought us the check with an included 20% gratuity.  We gave her our cards to run and she handed us back her swipe machine thing with the box checked for an additional 20% tip on top of the included 20% tip.  She didn't mention anything but I had to ask if I was mistaken that there was a 20% service charge included, and the box that was checked was to add an additional 20%.  She said yes, that box checks by default.  Cue eye roll.  Certainly COVID has been tough on everyone especially servers, and I would have no problem going above and beyond the normal tip IF service was incredible, but at the high price point of Hiroki we expected a whole lot more.  If the meal was exactly the same without the nickel and dime treatment from the management this would have been a five star review.",2021-01-26 22:03:40,698,3278,

The whole place during our place was clean, not packed, and very nice overall. It was my birthday celebration and got a recommendation from our friends to check out this place.  We ordered charboiled oysters, lobster mac and cheese, and a lacquered steak. Here's our personal review and feedback. The charboiled oyster were good. Not the best as we have tried best ones. I would wish that they would have charboiled the oyster a bit more and that more cheese and garlic. Then we ordered for lobster mac and cheese, and to our surprise... truffle mac and cheese was served. So they quickly fix the mix up with a side comment that they thought they hear we ordered for truffle mac and cheese (uhhh duh?! )  we dove into our lobster mac&cheese. Man! The lobster meat are generous!! Thumbs up. We have tried this from others that are well known for this kind of lobster m&c, and this definitely gave its own points on the table. I highly recommend it. The lacquered steak was served and really looks good. We ordered it medium well, i think it was pretty much well done which was ok for us especially my wife doesnt like pinkish color on the meat even if it is an expensive steak. Taste wise... strong flavors! Size wise of the steak is good based on the price. Why 4 stars? I will reserve 1 star due to our steak was dry inside. Maybe it is because we ordered medium well which was served as almost well done? Maybe. However, we have tried medium well steaks that were superbed , tender and not dry thus we know that it is possible to have these qualities on a medium well cooked steak. Done get us wron, it was dry as bone but would prefer it to be a bit more juicy and tender. Probably its the choice cut. Cant judge the whole restaurant based on 1 time dining. We will try this place again in the future and i will update my review accordingly. Overall, good experience and safe to dine in if not packed with people.

There was absolutely NO SEASONINGS what so ever on my fish or shrimp. I am sorry but none. I mean they need to taste the food they are putting out. My 2YO spit out his shrimp and would only eat the fries. My husband was so mad. 

When we ordered, we specifically asked if the platter was large enough for two because we were originally going to get the seafood platter but the person taking our order suggested the fish and shrimp platter. So we chose that. 

My husband ordered the food at 6:15pm and they told us the order would be ready in ten minutes. Now we live, and I'm not joking, 2 blocks away so we got there at 6:30pm and the food was not ready. The guy was nice and apologized for the tardiness. However, the food wasn't ready and in our hands until 6:50pm! So they said it would be ready in 10 minutes but it was in fact not ready for almost 40 minutes. I don't mind waiting but you told us ten minutes.

Getting off 64 at the Boyle exit is always the easiest way to get to Central West End. I avoid Kingshighway at ALL costs. As I was heading to my destination, I remembered Northwest Coffee is so conveniently located on Boyle! 

I have only ever been to this Black-owned coffee roaster once before since moving to St. Louis, and don't know why it took me so long to return. The coffee is fantastic! It's bold without being an over the top pallet wrecker. It's has the flavors of a craft roasted bean, unlike slightly larger roasters that have multiple locations and serve a somewhat homogenized brew that tastes mass-produced. The size of the large stood out to me. So many other coffee shops offer a ""large"" that leaves me needing another cup. This was a large enough serving of coffee that I feel ready to take on my day!

I had never had food from Northwest before, but a few pangs in my stomach when I perused the menu today goaded me into a breakfast treat. They offer an assortment of pastries and baked goods. The individually wrapped bagels were definitely tempting. I've seen photos of their waffles and almost ordered some with nutella, but since I was out and about, I decided to order their grab n' go breakfast wrap of the day. I think this concept is so smart.  I was expecting to have to wait to for my wrap to be made, but the wraps were premade and individually wrapped. In and out and back on task. The wrap I had was egg, cheddar and turkey bacon. The eggs were so fluffy! Loved the bits of salty turkey bacon too. I will say the edges of the wrap were a little dried out and crunchy. Not a huge problem, it made a few bites feel like I was eating nachos! 

Northwest is taking COVID precautions very seriously. They had outdoor covered seating that was very well spaced. There's a sign that asks for only customer or group to enter the ordering area at a time. I LOVED the hand drawn sign of how to properly wear a mask (COVER YOUR NOSE PEOPLE!)

Seriously cannot wait for warm weather to roll around so that I can take my laptop to Northwest and enjoy getting work done in their cozy outdoor space.",2021-01-28 16:25:06,467,2240,

We ordered the yellow curry, pineapple fried rice, and pad thai noodles, with a side of Jasmine rice. The rice was a smaller portion than I normally get from other Thai places, (barely enough rice for two servings) but since I had the pineapple fried rice I didn't mind. 
The curry was delicious and tasted just like a translational yellow curry. We ordered the spice level 2 and it was still pretty sweet, so I'd recommend ordering a higher spice level if you enjoy a kick of spice in your curry. 
The pineapple fried rice was also very tasty, however, I ordered beef with the dish, which honestly I was not impressed with. The beef was flavorless and very tough and I wish I had just stuck with chicken and saved three extra dollars. (Especially since the chicken was very good) 
Lastly, the pad Thai noodles were very disappointing. I always choose Thai food for the pad Thai so I was pretty bummed when I tasted these pad Thai noodles. They did not taste like any pad Thai noodles I have ever tasted before--even homemade. They had a very strong tomato and vinegar taste, which overpowered any other ingredients in the noodles. Additionally tomato/vinegar is not what I'm expecting when eating Thai food. Normally all the Thai dishes blend well with one another but I had to eat the Thai noodles separately so the tomato taste did not overtake the other delicious dishes. 
I wouldn't say this restaurant is awful, I just would not recommend or choose to eat here again, especially with so many great Thai restaurants in Sparks/Reno.",2021-01-31 01:40:42,320,1613,

The most unprofessional place I have ever been to. I will never go back, and I will tell everyone to stay away if you don't want your jewelry or watch to get messed up. The job is very sloppy. They don't have the skills and do not know how to fix or repair the jewelry. Gave it a 1 because I can't put a -10 !!!

I experienced extremely poor customer service I had received during my visit to the King of Prussia location of Fast-Fix Jewelry And Watch Repair in King of Prussia Mall on January 8th.

I paid 155 dollars to mount a diamond on a new six-prong platinum ring setting on January 6th. I waited for 2 hours and took the ring back home and I noticed that the head is skewed, the prongs are still curved and tilted, and there are tool marks left on my new setting! I went back to talk to the front lady, the lady told me that they will re-set the diamond, and remove the tool marks left on the setting. She asked me to send a picture of the original setting and told me to go there the next day. She promised that they will fix everything for me, so I waited for one more day and went back on the 8th. When I went there again, the front lady was rude and showed an attitude. I noticed that the head of the ring is still skewed, and there are more tool marks on the setting. Another lady told me that they did not re-set the ring, they just grind down the side of the prongs to make them not look curved. I paid for all the platinum, and I like how it was before, it was not thick, it does not need to grind down. They never asked me before they grind down my ring. I was very concerned that now my setting got more damaged, so I politely expressed my concerns. A lady from the store was mad, she said my setting was old and the ring looks perfect to her. She did not listen to me but yelled at me and told me to go away. She was extremely rude and talked down to me. The boss was sitting on the back of the store watching and supporting her. I've never seen any repair service like this. I paid 155 dollars to get my new setting damaged. Now I have to find a better professional jewelry store and not even sure if they can fix the prongs and the head and remove all the tool marks left on my setting. 

After contacting the corporate store for this incident, the lady holds grudges and sent me angry text messages. I don't recommend anyone who wants good services and professional work.",2021-01-09 14:15:18,546,2514,

Mr. Jeerasak is so kind -- he once graciously obliged to serve me pad thai at 10am from his food truck, a whole hour before they officially opened for business! --  and I was so excited to learn that he and his wife, Mrs. Suda were opening a brick-and-mortar, living example of ""mom and pop"" restaurant!

We dined in the casually romantic pink restaurant on a Friday night without making a reservation because we typically eat pretty early. I'd recommend making one though if you're going to dine at 6pm or later. Because we were early, we got to catch some of their happy hour specials. From the HH menu, we ordered the chicken sticks, veggie egg rolls, and shrimp and cheese rolls as part of the 3 mini apps for $10; the creamy Tom Yum soup for $5, and the roti with red curry sauce also for $5. Everything was delicious but oh my goodness, you have got to get the roti with the red curry sauce! The sauce is to dieeee for! 

For our actual meals, we got the egg fried rice and veggie pad thai with no tofu cooked at a medium spice level. Whew, that medium spicy is something good, yall! It was a tad spicy even for my Indian palette so I'd recommend going for mild and asking for sriracha on the side in case you don't wanna wrestle with your GERD later on in the night. All of this was washed down with some Singha beer, served with a frosted glass, of course! 

On a previous occasion, I picked up two veggie pad thais to go and they were packaged really well. I do think that pad thai tends to congeal a tad so I'd recommend either dining in or eating it ASAP.

Service was excellent! COVID precautions in place. Please check out Thai D'Jing for your next thai food craving! Their menu is available online. And for my fellow, LSU folks -- there are plans to bring the truck back at some point!",2021-01-23 23:59:59,411,1915,

The food is different now, NO FLAVOR. I don't know if they're dumbing down the food for white people but it lacks flavor and is BLAND. I ordered ""Hot and Sour"" soup, it was neither hot nor sour, it was BLAND BLAND BLAND. I complained and every time I spoke I got heavy accented jibber and they spoke over me so I couldn't make any points.

Then the manager came over and told me that HOT and sour soup isn't spicy.... ya know, because I'm stupid. I told her I've ordered it before and it was always spicy and why is it called ""hot"" then, hot isn't because of the temperature, hot sauce isn't temperature ""hot"", she just kept rudely talking over me and not listening to me THEN BROUGHT OVER A (black) PEPPER SHAKER and told me I need to add black pepper to make my soup spicy, not the chili oil with crushed red peppers and sriracha sauce I was adding, that won't make my soup spicy, but the black pepper will, again... because I'm stupid. At this point all my food was COLD and I boxed it up, she yelled in her language to the rest of her staff that I'm taking the food I don't like home, lol. This little show has been played before I can tell... she's a veteran when it comes to fighting with customers.

RQVA3Xi6XPSjpijUYZS6NQ,ObPGKT9Is54TACrtic5cPg,qH13binX4ke_R1j3QNXccw,2,0,0,1,"This place is pretty mediocre. As this restaurant was a recent addition to my neighborhood I was more than excited to try it out. Unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations. 

I'll begin with the pros, Upon arrival I loved that they offered outdoor seating. I decided to dine inside the restaurant. The Interior design is absolutely gorgeous, from the exposed brick to the Italian football club flags hanging from the ceiling. I loved the ambiance of the entire resturant. One of my favorite parts of the restaurant was the open kitchen design, I loved being able to have a front-row seat to all the action in the kitchen. Another aspect that I really enjoyed was the bread and garlic dip, it truly added to the Italian aesthetic. The final pro is that they have reusable cups that you can take home and reuse. I think that is not only good marketing but also it's super eco friendly which is something I really appreciate.

Now unto the many cons, this restaurant felt overstaffed but for the most part, it is self-service. A staff member handed us the menus and we had to seat ourselves. Once we decided on what to eat I had to remember the orders for my party and then walk up to the register to place and pay for the meal. The Cashier handed me a tray with a bunch of silverware, cups, and a number for my table. After I paid, I had to get drinks myself for each member of my party. After that, the waiter brought us the delicious bread I mentioned earlier which I'm surprised that I didn't have to get myself. The waiter soon brought out our food and after we finished eating we were also responsible for getting our own take-out packing. The food was not that great it was pretty mediocre nothing special and little overpriced in my opinion.

The fact the restaurant was 90% self-service was really a point of dislike for me because the restaurant seemed to be overstaffed. Also, I feel like at the beginning when you go to a place and pay for your order the cashier strongly pushes you to tip. But for the most part, you are responsible for taking care of yourself. That really rubbed me the wrong way. 

Overall would I eat here again probably not. 4.5/10",2021-01-04 05:58:27,437,2167,

So the best of both worlds. What makes it even better, you can even have an option of three menus. They would also give you the dinner menu. 

From the lunch menu, We ordered the steak sandwich, burger with smoked Gouda and mushroom with wedge potatoes. From the happy hour menu, at 3 pm I ordered the broiled oysters. Everything was AMAZING! 

We loved everything about our order. My most fave were the broiled oysters.   The potatoes are huge. If you don't want potatoes the other option is a Caesar salad. I'm glad I got the potatoes because Id prob fight my hubby for some bites of the potatoes lol.

The steak sandwich and burger were great and I liked the burger more and my hubby liked the steak sandwich more. But it was perfect because we split both. 

Our server Meranda was awesome and helpful and patient and we really appreciated her. We were the only one in our section while the other outdoor section had a group. She would go back and forth to us and was the best.

So happy we tried this restaurant and had such a perfect lunch on a perfect day to sit outside. It's definitely a great experience and the fact we had so many options with their menus made it even more wonderful.

I have been here for 6 months now and since we moved, issue after issue. To start, the apartment was given to us dirty. Dirty fridge, dirty carpets, dirty kitchen, dirty AC vents. Then the stove had two burners that weren't working and pots were tilted because there was no support. When I asked the maintenance to replace the burners, the guy acted as I was resting for him to remodel the entire kitchen... like, if it's too much work, give me the burners and I will install them myself. Then the dryer vent was clogged, and the outlet covers were broken.  I literally went to Home Depot and bought new outlet covers and replaced them myself. I figured if I had asked maintenance to replace them, they would have thought I asked him to rewire the entire building. 
Now the noise issues. You guys replaced the carpets on the apartment above with the cheapest hardwood floors you found. I can hear everything that is happening in the apartment above mine. From the ""service dog"" (a puppy) running around, the continuous barking, a child running, to the renter who is always stumping.  When asked you to deal with the issue, you offered me to move ME and not the inconsiderate renter who lives above. You offer to see if getting area rugs would help and obviously over a month later nothing had been fixed. After I asked why I was the one asked to move you told the renter above that she could move... well... the renter still still up there. I have called the patrol officer at the complex to let her know she is getting loud but no changes. The noise is bad at all times of the day and night but I am considerate only call at night. I am tired of using by broom to hit the ceiling. I am about to make holes on the ceiling from having to hit it so often. 
Let's not talk about the roaches and mice in the complex, let's talk about the dog poop all over the stair cases, hallways and the grassy areas. I am tired of walking in the hallways and see dog poop on it, which by the way I can barely see because your staircases are so dark at night I am surprised the complex had not been fined over safety violations. 
Finally, let's mentioned lack of investment in this property. This complex as much potential as it did many years ago from what I read and researched, but at this time, management is neglecting the property. People describe the Saulet as ""the ghetto"" and based on the drug deals happening out my window, I agree... and I used to live in Harlem! 
I will update with more photos soon. Including the pic of where mice hang out.",2021-01-13 18:38:37,575,2718,

I live over an hour away, but I wanted to purchase a small nightstand. I went online to see if you offer curbside pickup and was happy to see that you do. I placed my order and at the time of ordering selected my pickup window of today from 10am - 7pm. I work during the day, so planned to leave right when I was done with work so that I could arrive before. I arrived at 6:15 and was extremely disappointed to be told by the man out there that they closed the curbside pickup at 6. He told me my only option was to go inside and get it from the service desk there. I tried to go inside but there were about 20 people waiting in line, not properly distanced and with masks slipping beneath their noses and people walking by maskless. My anxiety does not let me be in those situations without having a panic attack (not to mention the serious risk of COVID). I walked to the door twice more to peek in and see if the situation had improved. It had not. 

Meanwhile I had called the store number when I first arrived. I was greeted by someone not at the store. I explained what was going on and she said she was going to contact the store for me. I waited on hold for 34 minutes only to have a new agent answer the phone with no knowledge of my previous call. She actually did talk to the manager at the store and told me they close at dark due to safety reasons. That is absolutely unacceptable. If you need to close it at 6, fine. But say that when ordering and in the pickup email. 

I finally just had the second agent cancel my order. I wasted over 3.5 hours to go pick up something only to have to chose my health or the item that I purchased under the false assumption that I could do curbside pickup. Do better IKEA.",2021-01-30 02:01:45,377,1778,

You can score some excellent deals here now and then. I live a 30 minute drive from this place, but since this is the closest one near me, I occasionally come here. I certainly think that it's worth it to come back every few weeks just to see what deals are going on.

One thing to note is that you should always check the expiration date on the things you buy here. Sometimes, that date is tomorrow or even today. But other times, it is a few weeks or months out (especially for the frozen items). I have not bought any fresh meat here yet, but I found that I got a lot of packaged goods and frozen foods the few times that I've already been here.

You might notice that there are a lot of very big, boxed items. It seems to me that some of their inventory comes from Sams Club or BJ's or Costco (basically, wholesale membership clubs) where these size items would be found. That isn't true for all of their items, but for a lot of them.

It's unfortunate that a lot of their inventory varies, because I have found some deals here that I would never be able to find anywhere else. One thing that I still can't stop thinking about to this day is the 4-pack of Frontera chicken fajita bowl dinners that I got here for $8 total, when they are $4.69 EACH at Whole Foods. I never saw them at Grocery Outlet again. Speaking of which, they do have a decent selection of high-quality, health-conscious items if you are interested in that sort of thing.

You don't always have to spend big to find some great options at the grocery store. Grocery Outlet is evidence of that. That being said, I personally do not utilize Grocery Outlet for ALL of my shopping needs. There are some things I like to get elsewhere, but I am not opposed to trying them at Grocery Outlet at some point in the future (such as the fresh meat that I mentioned). And although I do not use Grocery Outlet as a primary source for my groceries, I certainly think that you could. They do sell it all, from kitchenwares to baked goods to fresh foods to frozen foods, and more.

I am a regular customer and I will return here every few weeks. I only wish that there were more Grocery Outlet stores near me. I even turned one of my friends on to this store by sending them pictures of the absolutely crazy deals that I have found before.

I've been ordering from here since they opened. I've been reading the reviews. And tonight I experienced what they have been saying. 
I've been eating Greeks for years and never had a bad pizza from any location. $28 dollars for an XL 2 topping pizza and 1 order of sticks. I asked ""please don't cut the pizza"" (nobody here knows how to cut a pizza). 
I showed up and I see a sign- $5.00 off any order over $25.00. Huh. My order was $28. Did I get $5 off?  Did my order start at $33?  One 2 topping pizza and 1 order of breadsticks for $33?  Oh well. Whatever. 
""Sir, I'm sorry we had a shift change and the person I told to not cut your pizza left"". Yea I figured. All you had to do is right down, but whatever. 
I pay $28 and leave. I get home and grab a breadstick noticing that they are all different sizes. Typical for a place that cuts and rolls their own breadsticks. 
So I call my family down for dinner. Open the box and there is not a single slice that is cut evenly. The edge of the pizza is so thick that the topping slid down to the super thin center. The biggest slice had 1 pepperoni on it. One. The other side of the pizza had at least 2 slices that had an oven bubble in it because all the topping including the cheese were non existent. 
$28 dollars. 
I called and told them I'm bringing it back to get my money back. I arrived and the girl already refunded my money. That's a good move. But I had to explain. She stated that they are having problems with their oven. I had to call her out. I'm sorry, I've made more pizzas in my life than this place has since it opened. I was a General Manager of local pizza chain. I've won pizza making competitions. Blaming the oven is B.S.  What this is, is a lack of caring. 
It's hard letting kids run you place. I know. I had to let it happen. But the owners need to get it under control. It's a shame because Greeks is great pizza. Locally owned. I don't want to see them suffer but there is to much competition in this town to serve expensive pizza at a poor quality. 
This is really the first bad pizza I have gotten from here, but one is enough.

We were very excited, as this was our first dinner during a few days getaway to St Louis.  Getting there from our downtown hotel was a breeze.  Parking, no problem.  Walking up to the door, the cafe tables and outside tent for hardy diners was brilliant.  The interior didn't disappoint either.  Great decor.

Cocktails, great.  I ordered a simple bowl of the olives as a started.  Our server told us about the mussels dinner special, which sounded great...but we both wanted something else.  So, he proposed a half order as an appetizer.  Very glad he did so, because they were outstanding.

Cassoulet for my husband.  Coq au vin for me.  Each dish was really good, although mine was definitely more enjoyable of the two.  I'm just not sure why, but you will never find me ordering a cassoulet anywhere but in France. American versions for some reason tend to be overcooked and dry.  That was the case here as well.  Good flavor, but just dry.

We had a bottle of lovely wine to go with our meals...just under $40 for a great bordeaux (middle of the full page of red wines by the bottle).

Our server brought us a complimentary slice of cake for dessert.  Very kind!

Total meal plus tip came to over $200 for us both, but we ate and drank well.  No complaints on the price.  No complaints about anything.  Excellent, friendly, but not too friendly service (no hanging over the table).

I was in line to go on the merry go round. When I was in line I was greeted by one of the workers. Then when I proceeded to get on the ride right before the merry go round was going to start, he promptly told me I couldn't ride the merry go round and didn't really give a reason why. I have so many questions, first being why? And where did it say there was an age or weight limit? I'm 163 pounds and 5'3 and I'm midsized. And secondly, why did the worker not tell me AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE RIDE so it would've saved me time from lining and I would've left. I, of course, didn't want to start a scene so I complied. I'm very disappointed and wish he was more clear about the guidelines. I understand there was many kiddie rides and it was geared more towards children but I thought maybe AT LEAST the merry go round would take me since I've been on it once before in 2019. 

We spent 87 bucks for 2 people to come in and it was not worth the money as a lot of exhibits and rides were closed and it's a very small zoo. The food was also stale and was overpriced, I get it's a tourist attraction but atleast give out what people are paying for, ie) fresh food. 

THE ONLY GOOD THING I CAN SAY IS that the workers on the trolley were very friendly. I tried calling their guest services number today but no one picked up and was put on hold for a while.

I was never able to quite get on board with the Saint Louis style pizza, except for one place out in North County. The cracker crust doesn't quite do it for me with the provel cheese mix. So I often look for varieties of pizza places in the city that can give me the famous NY style or the phenomenal Chicago deep dish style. 

I came across Detroit style last year and I really liked the pan style thickness of the pizza, it was deep dish but different than Chicago style deep dish. It reminded me of Pizza Huts pan pizza, but less ""chain-like"". 

Recently I read some reviews for this place and I HAD to try it. I LOVED the pizza! I wish I got it ""Detroit Style"" sauce on top option because the only issue I had was the thickness of the pizza and not enough sauce. But luckily I ordered a side of sauce and dumped it on top and it was perfect! 

The crust is buttery/crispy (think Lou Malnatis butter crust but fluffier). The dough isn't too heavy and was perfect to prevent you from getting too full too fast or experiencing a super doughy pizza that gets gooey in your mouth. 

I got the Model P and Yo Street In a Range. The Red Hot Riplets on top gave it a pretty amazing extra kick to it. This will most definitely be a go to spot moving forward because it had all the elements of a great pizza in my opinion.

For one, the dentist has almost completely outsourced his role to various assistants. You will only see him if you need a numbing shot or a tooth glued in. 

Second, while everyone is nice enough, the customer service is terrible. At $1,200 a crown,  I should be very satisfied with my dental work - I am not. In fact, they had me sign my monetary rights away to a veneer, which I clearly stated did not fit, while I was in extreme pain and exhausted from being drilled on in a spot that was not numb-able. 

Discussion regarding ""my case"" was largely BS with weak offers of amending things like paying an additional lab fee for a different set of veneers, or whitening trays.
Additionally, I called a few times to get a reimbursement and was screened. They have not approved my credit card chargebacks. 

Third, they have zero respect for your time. I took four whole sick days from work because of issues with their lab. Instead of switching me to their new lab, they continued to send my teeth to this inept lab in order to save money. 

I was so dissatisfied with my experience that I did not complete my dental work with this dentist. I have an appointment with another dentist to finish my crowns and treat my TMJ.
My case may not be the norm with this office, but consider yourself warned. 

Update: I need to get the two front crowns Jody completed less than a year ago redone because they weren't installed properly for me. Something about them not touching the bone under my gum line is causing irritation.",2021-01-06 23:02:35,322,1586,

They left me to change my own trailer tire next and said I had to pull next to their dumpster with a flat tire and told me I had to do it there because they refused to help. They don't care about people and don't even follow their own policies. 

I pulled in with a low tire on my small covered trailer. Brenna told me I could use their jack and tire iron and take off the tire and they'd patch it because the bays were full. By this time my tire had completely deflated. After going to the garage they said they didn't have a tire iron but did have a wrench and socket, I was then told told by Brenna actually I can't use that and I'd have to pull my completely flat trailer up to the bay where they could use a an air wrench. I explained to her that it would likely destroy the tire and possibly damage my rim. Why they couldn't come out and use a Jack and wrench instead of me as to not damage something I don't know. But no, I'd have to pull there. So I did. The tire was ruined beyond repair. They said they don't have any in stock, so I said I have no choice but to go pick up a tire somewhere else and put it on my trailer. Now the total BS began. 

They said in no way would they help me in just tightening the lug nuts on the wheel when I got back. It's ""their policy"" that they will not put a tire on unless it's brand new. I mentioned they just took off my used tire and was going to put it back on, so what's the difference? I said l could I go get the tire replaced, put it on the trailer and have them take it off, inspect and put back on if we had to, which is completely within their policy. Also willing to pay for it as I had no Jack or tire iron. They said absolutely they would not be helping me out in anyway as much as tightening my lugs for me. Absolute pricks that don't care about people. 

Ok then, I said I'd have to pull into the parking lot and unhook from my small covered trailer then and go pick up a tire replacement and do it all myself since they were unwilling to help. They said ok. I also said I'd like to put my other spare which does not hold air with a rim split on the trailer so I could take the good rim and get a new tire. They were willing to put another tire that's busted on my trailer, but refused to put a good one on or even tighten lugs for me. Complete hypocrisy. We just filled the newly busted tire that was leaking bad and I pulled into the parking lot only to have Brenna come out and instigate their unhelpful attitude even farther and say ""oh you know what, I'm going to call my manager about you parking in the parking lot."" Again my tire deflates and I'm too far away to get any air. After she agreed I could pull into the parking lot she tells me I have to pull over by the dumpster which is on uneven ground and you have to stick out in the road to park there and change it myself. They have more than 6 parking spots and did the whole time I was there but just to spit in my eye, they can't allow me to park for an hour to help me in being stranded. 

So on a incline with a completely loaded trailer 3 hours from my home I had to change the tire myself in front the dumpster of the tire shop. Again they didn't care if I'd damage my rim in driving on a flat. Thank God it didn't slip off the Jack. I unhooked, bought a Jack and iron, took off the tire, went got a replacement and put back on as if I was on the side of the road. I also had to back my truck up the trailer and hitch it on an incline by myself. With the incline change the trailer would not lower onto the ball, so I had to use a Jack to try to lower it low enough onto the ball. It slipped off the Jack because of the angle and by some miracle landed on the ball. If it hadn't I would have been in a bigger bind because it was too heavy to lift. 

Thanks for nothing, both Brenna Hall and her manager Heather Woolf don't give a damn about helping anyone. First time I've had to change my own tire at a tire shop because the people are pricks and forced me into a dangerous situation. They caused more damage to my tire and multiple times told me I could do something and then turned around and made it harder for no legitimate reason. Learn from my experience, go somewhere else, there's so many other tire shops in the area and that actually care about people.",2021-01-07 00:01:47,978,4380,

We went early because we had tickets to the botanical garden. We had 1-3/4 hours to enjoy our dinner. We sat down and were promptly served water and bread but had no silverware. 15 minutes go by and we are finally approached by our server for drinks. We decide to order a bottle of red wine. They had something new on the menu so we tried it. 15 minutes later we taste it. It's terrible. We look at the menu again and ask for a different bottle. Another 15 min go by she brings us a different bottle.  Not what we ordered but to figure out what we like? We order our final bottle and place our dinner order and tell the server we need to be done quickly. 20 minutes and she brings our wine. It's good we are happy. We are now down to 30-40 minutes till we need to leave.  Another waiter comes by in 15 or so minutes and another server asks us what did we order. We tell him and state we are a bit pressed for time.  1-1/2 later we get our food and ask for the check and k go the bottle. My chicken speidini was good but didn't have prosciutto in it like the menu. My husbands angle hair pasta in red sauce with sausage was not so good. We finally get our bill after heading to the bar to get it from a server. And it's wrong. They over charged us for our wine. They fix the bill. And nothing.

As luck would have it, everyone arrived at the same time. Our reservation was for 10pm. We all walked up to the door that is semi-hidden and gave the secret password. We were let in and the host took our name and brought us to our table. We were sat in an open area near the bar where two tables were put together. Half-booth and half chairs. Our group ended up only being 9 when it was supposed to 14.

Our only thing here was drinks. No food since we all had dinner already. My first drink was a mint julep. A classic but excellent drink. The strong taste of bourbon with the sweet finish was perfect. The drink was made with a lot of ice and was super cold in it's copper mug. The mint garnish added a nice taste. For my 2nd drink, I had the Old Cuban. This drink had Flor de Cana rum, lime, mint, bitters and champagne. It was sweet, slightly sparkling and fantastic actually. It was smooth but the zing from the lime and mint came through. I liked this one the best.

I tried a couple other drinks from around the table as well and everything was prepared fresh and unique. One had a burnt cinnamon stick in it. Drinks did take a while, maybe 20 minutes for us all. Our server was friendly and was helpful in explaining the drinks to us. 

One thing that surprised me was that the bill was not as bad as I thought it would be. The total for at least 12 drinks was around $130 something. I'm not sure the exact price. We all had one and a few people had two. They don't split checks for large groups so keep that in mind.

All in all, it was a good experience. Living in Riverview, I don't see myself traveling all the way to South Tampa for a drink regularly but would definitely keep it in mind for special occasions.",2021-01-11 20:12:07,408,1878,

Everyone was wearing masks. We asked for a table instead of a booth, so they directed us to the enclosed patio to see if it was warm enough for us to be comfortable out there. It was, so we were seated and the waitress came immediately. I was disappointed that they do not make their own Bloody Mary mix any longer (because of COVID) but they did offer an alternative bottled mix with a house mixed salt. The waitress was super pleasant and helpful. We had the Steak Salad, which was a great combo of flavors with mixed greens, blue cheese, gluten free homemade fried onion rings and very tender(but not MSG'd)tenderloin chunks in a Madeira wine reduction. It comes with your choice of dressing but I used half of one of 2 Basil dressings that they brought and because of the wine, I could've used less and still had enough dressing. It was delicious. We had Chili and waffle fries too. I found the Chili a little sweet but that's just preference, it came with shredded- real cheddar cheese and chopped green onions. The waffle fries were a good sized basket and well cooked. Just those 3 things was more than enough for the 2 of us. I couldn't finish the salad and I only had a bite of the chili and a couple of fries. I wasn't crazy about the Bloody Mary and not having their own mix as advertised on their web sight. This is the only reason that I didn't give 5 stars. I was impressed with everything else.

YFyUr7Wfqvp6hqhtIOGJ5Q,QbjDu2oiR_cFn3jNOHzR2w,stVYNXP80X6HGarzMOWo1w,4,0,0,0,"UPDATE: After a very long and very productive conversation between my father in law and Hawthorne plumbing, Hawthorne agreed to coming out and fixing everything (with the help of my father in law where carpentry needed to be done and when an extra pair of hands was needed). They got to my place bright and early and got everything done by 1:30ish, which was AMAZING. There is a lot to be said for a company that is willing to fix their mistakes and make sure everyone agrees on the quality of work being done, which changes this Two Star to a Four Star. Thank you, Hawthorne, for your integrity--while I wish none of this happened, I'm just happy be able to shower again! 

Long story short: a $4500 one day job becomes a 5 day job that ends unfinished and costs me an extra day (at
Least) and $300 to fix. 

Here's the thing: Hawthorne has come out more than once to my place and generally is able to fix what they need to. The people they send are usually nice, courteous, what have you. This time, however, was different. About a year ago I had a leak in my bathroom that they came out to fix and they let us know that eventually the whole bathroom would need to be redone because of the pipes. No problem. So back in November of 2020 the leak starts up again and is getting worse fast, so we call Hawthorne out to set up something more permanent. They come out, do not fix the leak, and sign me up for a $4500 remodel of our tub and shower. Why didn't they fix the leak? Who knows but a few weeks later it's no longer a leak, the hot water won't shut off at all and there is a risk of my bathroom flooding--call Hawthorne again and they come out and fix it in less than an hour. The tech again explains that an entire remodel needs to be done, I agree and say I already set up financing, bada bing bada boom. 

We finally get someone out last Friday to do ""at max a day and a half to get everything done."" Not ideal, but no worries, as long as I have a working shower as soon as possible! So day one comes to an end (all the while I'm in the next room hearing the tech go ""this is a nightmare"" ""that's not going to work"" and calling someone to come help him because ""I've never done this before--I'll give
you the job, just please come help me this is too much for me man"") and the tech--who is very nice, just unprepared--tells me that it isn't done. Why? Because the replacement tub insert that he brought (which, by the way, I have never seen or approved previous to the installation, which I should have checked on granted, but also you'd think that a professional would have made sure it was approved BEFORE installation) doesn't fit so he had to TEAR APART MY CEILING in order to fit it. Oh but they don't do drywall, so I'll have to call another contractor that they work with all the time to fix it. 

Day two comes and he and another tech finish what they need to do, check for leaks (they found one and presumably fix it) and leave. My husband and I call my father in law who was a contractor (mostly carpentry but also plumbing and landscaping) for 40 years comes to fix
our drywall so we have a working shower. He's PISSED. Apparently the tub was put in incorrectly, which led to a 1.5 inch gap between the tub and the tile, which he estimates will cost 200-400 to fix since we have to go buy new tile to fill the gap. They also cut through the fire wall between our unit and the one next to us and installed the faucet and spout incorrectly, which may lead to rust problems. He calls them, talks to the supervisor who agrees to send out his guys again, and that brings us to today. After talking together they agree with my
Father in law to fix the problems (which he also agrees to help them with) and he leaves to go get supplies. The tech then comes to me and says Just kidding, we aren't doing anything and now I have to go to another job. I then confronted the tech about how this was all caused by a lack of him communicating with me, which he agreed to, but did not fix. 

This is just unacceptable. I feel like they took advantage of my lack of technical knowledge and then refused accountability when confronted. Now my father in law is fixing it himself (we would have had him do it the first
time but he just had back surgery) and I have to pay another $200-$400 for fixing my tile. What a wa",2021-01-13 23:06:40,959,4321,

I recently noticed that they opened up a new location at the Westfield Mall in Brandon. It's actually where the Starbucks used to be across from the Apple store. I didn't even see it the last time I was at the mall, and I'm not sure how I passed it up.

Anyway, today's mall visit was specifically to try the Dirty Thaiger. I arrived at 9:30 and the mall was still closed.  Apparently they open at 10 AM now. I didn't know that and Yelp had this café listed as opening at 9 AM. I patiently waited outside until the mall opened. Meanwhile, my hair turned into a chia pet because of this wonderful high humidity here in Florida. Yeah, naturally curly hair doesn't have a chance in this climate. Fortunately, it was well worth the wait.

There were no lines and virtually no one but me and the baristas. I saw the menu and almost changed my order. They have so many unique offerings such as turmeric ginger tea and vanilla butternut latte, but I decided to stick with the iced Dirty Thaiger. I'm glad I tried it. It's basically a blend of espresso, Thai tea, and sweetened condensed milk with cinnamon sprinkled on top. It was lovely and not as sweet as Thai tea. The roasted flavor of the espresso stood out more than the tea, as it should. It was really good! I'd get it again. They also have Oatly oat milk which I really love in my lattes. They had other non dairy options as well.

I also couldn't pass up the large guava and cheese pastry that I saw in the case. I asked and was told that the company makes them. I think they make all of their desserts. I was happy to hear that. She warmed it up for me which I definitely recommend. It was very good and full of cheese and guava. It was much larger than I thought but well worth it.

As you pay, you'll be prompted to enter your cell phone number via Square. It's super easy and you'll get a text right after that saying you've earned a punch. You'll get 1 extra punch if you join their mailing list. So now I'm just 8 away from a free drink. Yay! I think I will get the turmeric ginger latte next time. They also have hot breakfast and lunch items. I'm looking forward to trying some next time. Glad to finally see a local coffee option at the mall.",2021-01-23 20:26:16,502,2268,

There is very limited seating so if you just show up you were not likely to get a table. In addition if you make a reservation don't show up early because they will ask you to wait until your reservation time.

Restaurant is very cozy and seating is not 6 feet apart.  However they do sanitizing between guests and change table cloth linens.  

Staff is very friendly and accommodating.  I think they do an amazing job considering the small space that they're working in. 

Tonight we ordered Croquettes and  the mushrooms for an appetizer.  For dinner my husband ordered the meatballs and I ordered the fillet medallions. Each entrée comes with a soup and a salad and a side of rice.  Be sure to specify if you have a shellfish allergy so your rice can come with veggies instead of shrimp.  For dessert my husband got the flan and I tried to Gateau. 

My most favorite part of our meal where the croquettes.  The legend is true, there is good as what everybody says they are!  I really could have made a meal just on those! They really were the highlight and the star of the night.

The mushrooms we're good flavorful and had a good sauce. 

Our salad-  it had an amazing vinaigrette house dressing on it that was light and citrusy and very tasty.  The proportion was perfect in the amount of salad dressing was perfect.  

My red bean soup was delicious! The portion size was very generous for a cup of soup.  I really enjoyed that.   My husband had the clam chowder and he said it was pretty good.

The fillet medallions were covered in a flavorful white sauce and this side of rice and vegetables was generous and tasted pretty good.  My hubby said the meatballs were excellent. 

Dessert was pretty good as well the flan had a very nice caramel sauce over it which gave it a very tasty sweet flavor.  The Gateau Was pretty dense, almost hard to eat but the raspberry sauce on the plate was excellent. 

This was our first time here and it was really nice.  I would definitely recommend going.

Starting with the nigiri rice, it's moist and sticky but not gooey. With medium texture and a hint of sweetness. Perfect. The rice in the rolls is lighter and dryer, so it soaks up the sauces better. Yummm. 

For fish, the Toro was like butter. The Aji was light and fresh. And the Unagi had a nice char with ponzu that wasn't too sweet. 

The standards, like salmon, yellowtail and tuna, are all well sized, not too cured and reasonably priced. 

We got the ""Carlos Roll"", with diced spicy tuna, cucumber, asparagus and roe. The components are delicious. But the internal ingredients are wrapped in nori, then covered in rice, so it ends up too big of a bite per piece. And the nori doesn't cut well, so it all falls apart. BUT very tasty. 

The Midiroi Saki Maki roll was very well proportioned (bite sized), with spicy salmon, avocado and chili sauce. Very good. 

We also got some gyoza. But it was probably the worst part of the meal, but only because it lacked the crisp of a nice pan sear. On the other hand, the ginger and pork was nicely seasoned. So I would still order them again.

Arriving to Keel & Curley Winery youll have to park across the lot. So you do have to walk a bit. 
The bar/restaurant was packed with a 50 minute wait (in fairness it was a Saturday). The hostess let us know that there were food trucks on the property if we wanted to try them instead. So I decided to visit the petting zoo and eat from the local food trucks. We had two options and We picked the Italian truck.Ordered some pasta while I waited for the tour. I visited the animals they had on the farm but was a bit disappointed as they're was only one of each animal. (Minus the chickens) 
Our tour time came, we loaded up into the tractor but the guide made it clear that this was a rushed tour due to two weddings taking place that night. We left a couple at the food truck and had to backup That's how rushed they were I guess. Although, the guide was informative the tour it self felt rushed and not very organized.

Before leaving we returned to the hostess stand to pick up some cider and beer-- prices are amazing! The cider is OMG good! I love mango and pineapple flavors. The Apple wine IS A MUST TRY!

Came here New Year's Eve without a reservation, but thanks probably to COVID, there were spots at the bar. Ordered a Manhattan, which was good but not great, and a cheese board. 

Cheese board was mostly ""eh.""  A few small crumbles of Gouda, Parmesan, and another cheese but nothing overly tasty and a few accoutrements. Honestly, there are many more interesting things on the menu for an appetizer, but I was feeling cheese. Unfortunately, this was weak and disappointing. 

For dinner, I ordered the Queen of Hearts for a drink-which was definitely a highlight (an amazing drink)-the 14oz grass fed strip steak, brussel sprouts and a baked potato. 

The steak and potato came out in iron skillets, and although the steak was cooked perfectly, it was room temperature at best. Probably should point out that it was a good 15 minutes between finishing the cheese board and getting the steak, so it probably sat in the window too long. The steak was good-no doubt about that-and for the price it was a good option, but it shouldn't have been luke warm

The baked potato was also good but it came out covered in cream. The menu says something about brûléed marshmallow, but honestly, it tasted like a mountain of sour cream. I'm probably wrong about what it was, but it was too much, whatever it was. Maybe you like that, but I was scooping it off. Minus the cream, it was very good. 

The Brussels were amazing. Hands down. Cooked in beef tallow and bacon, I loved em. 

Service was, okay. Bartenders left me alone, which I appreciated since I was reading, but when I finished my cheese board and dinner, it was a good 5-10 minutes before they took away dishes and asked me if I needed anything.  

All in all, a mixed affair. Food was good, but experience was less than stellar. Steak was cooked right, but came out room temperature. Cheese board was a miss. As this is Riverview and I live in St. Petersburg, I doubt I'd have many opportunities to come back anyway. I'll stick with Datz, which is one of the best restaurants in Tampa and St Pete, and stick with Charley's, ocean prime, Flemmings or Eddie Vs if I want a steak. That said, maybe I'll come back and try something else, but I won't be in any rush. 

Sorry Datz people-I still love you and Datz and dough and Dr BBQ will always be go-to's for me, and roux will always be a fond memory. However, I guess no one is perfect and this place needs improvement.",2021-01-01 01:56:34,563,2613,

Pros:
Great atmosphere 
Great music
Pretty views
Jalapeño poppers
Other food is pretty good as well, no food complaints 

Cons:
Service is below average
Set expectations low regarding service 
Servers are nice, they just need your help - not being an asshole by that but see Tips below 

Pro Tip:
Don't assume silverware, plates, and napkins are coming. They aren't.
As soon as you order drinks just ask for silverware, plates, and napkins right away. If you don't your food will come out and you'll be waiting for a server while your food gets cold.
If you anticipate needing a box at any point in your meal, don't wait for the end and just ask your server for one well in advance of you actually needing the box.


Enjoy your time there! It's a very pretty place!

Advice for the restaurant:
Figure out a way of ensuring the staff is making a very strong effort in leaving the tables with silverware, napkins, and plates. I'm not sure how this is consistently missed but this issue has honestly come up every time I've been there and only tonight after visiting did I decide it's time to follow my own tips. I actually went searching for my own box and found one on the service cart. I wasn't even mad bc it was expected...but there is a part of you that truly feels disappointed in spending a bunch of money there and needing to go hunting for things on your own and needing to ask for necessities when eating out. Make a station where people can and/or are expected to just get these items themselves if needed. Idk, But I love everything else about your establishment.",2021-01-06 01:05:31,336,1634,

I ordered, pre-paid and pre-tipped online and received an email confirmation immediately. When it was time to pickup I drove over, found a spot immediately in front of the door (where I could see distanced diners enjoying their lunches indoors) called them to tell them I had arrived, and it was out to my car almost by the time I hung up. 

The bag was small and there were no extra sauces, napkins, forks, menus, etc. included -- which, as a now-frequent-carry-out-diner I appreciated. The bag was stapled closed and my receipt w/my order was on the outside. We were home in 10 minutes and the food was still warm! 

We ordered the 2 un-happy meals for our kids which were the perfect amount of food for each (1 chicken nuggets which were clearly house-made and super lightly breaded breast meat, and 1 slider). The fries were included in the same box as their main entrees to reduce on waste -- AND there was a fun little dino figurine buried in the fries. The kids scarfed them down!  There is 1 drink option - a Hi-C juice box. 

For the grown folks we each got a burger, split an order of fries, and ordered the slaw (which we didn't eat). My husband got the Insta-swag and I got the plane Jane. They were amazing. The buns were firm egg buns (I think) and tasted good. I'm one who often gets my burgers wrapped in lettuce because a bun isn't worth the calories if it doesn't taste good -- but these buns tasted good and held up for the amazingly gooey crispy burgers and toppings loaded on them. The plain jane was perfect - the cheese was crispy (reminiscant of punch burgers burnt cheese burger). The Insta-swag burger looked good, and I was told it was epic, but I didn't actually GET a bite. Next time, friends. 

All in all, I loved the way they cook their burgers. Their housemade aioli was awesome. The homemade pickles were great. The fries tasted great, but were thin shoestring, so just know going in. The only thing I was NOT a fan of was the Rad slaw. It was charred radicchio. And it tasted like charred radicchio. Just not my jam. I went back for a second bite and it was confirmed. 

We'll be back, and I bet we'll probably all order exactly the same thing. I think this could be the kind of place we'd go for a lazy Saturday lunch w/the kids when we're ready to head back into a restaurant -- but for the time being their take-out game is ON POINT so we're happy to continue ordering that way!",2021-01-25 14:21:49,534,2517,

Let's be a little more transparent about this.  I brought my cat into your office on January 5th with a urinary obstruction.  After ""hoping for the best,"" you suggested a follow-up appointment on the 13th of January.  Well, jaxders was in and out of your clinic for days following the original appointment.  He was brought back the next day and you kept him over night for 24 hours. After he still seemed to not be doing well, and entrusting you with his care- I brought him back.  You had him there from Friday (1/8) to Monday (1/11).  When I picked him up, you never had the decency to go over what treatment was given to him over the weekend or any prognosis.  You handed him to me in his carrier and said you were closing soon and have other patients to attend to. The only calls I received after that point, which I'm assuming you were well aware my cat was dying- was from your receptionist.  I specifically asked to speak to you for days after getting him home. He was not okay when he got out of his crate after the 72 hours of being at your facility.  He was staggering, couldn't walk right and you blamed it on his pain medication - a dose which was far less that he had originally which just made him slightly groggy.  You said this was normal. I remained hopeful, kept calling your office and kept getting excuses for not hearing from you. Once again, I trusted you as a Doctor.  Thursday night (1/14) my cat couldn't move his back legs.  At 0800 the next morning I called your clinic and expressed how ridiculous it was I hadn't heard from you, personally.  I guess you can do surgery on an animal while answering questions I'm asking your receptionist but don't have an extra 5 minutes out of your busy schedule to do a follow up.  You knew you ruptured his bladder while he was in your treatment.  He wasn't peeing in your care, he was LEAKING BECAUSE YOU RUPTURED HIS BLADDER AND NEVER SAID A GOD DAMN THING.  You tried covering it up, and you knew what the outcome was going to be.  The other vet concurred with my own research as a layperson that his bladder had been ruptured.  What did you say after 25 years of practice? It could possibly be a blood clot.  So you could get more money out of me.  Thank you to the caring, amazing vet who was so supportive and let me hold my baby in my arms as she put him down.  I am so glad you weren't the one who got the pleasure of doing so.",2021-01-23 08:45:42,514,2419,

THE GOOD..... for the most part the massages are very pleasant.  The therapists are on time and knowledgeable in their craft.  As with most places it may take awhile to find the therapist you like, they all have different techniques and their own personal style. 

The membership is looking positive now, but it takes awhile to learn how it actually works.  This could be better explained on the website. 

THE BAD...the front desk staff is where this place needs some help.  Sometimes they talk to you like your an annoyance on the phone, if you ask who is available, and what times do they have.  Most places have it where you can make a reservation online, by looking at the availability of the therapist and the times available.  

Secondly, Instead of welcoming you into the facility, they push an iPad in your face and say ""take this  COVID Test"".  We are trying to get back out into the world, where is the hospitality?!?

THE BOTH.... Massageluxe has a hydro massage machine (something unique) which comes in handy before or after a massage.  You can touch up on spots that may need more work.  It is totally customizable, so you can set it to the exact pressure you like. It's a great add on!  The last time I went this bed was unavailable, and they said it had been broken for days, without a date for it's repair.  If something is broken, you fix it or you advise clients on your website or when they are booking the appointment. 

I hope you found this review helpful, both the Yelp community and the business.",2021-01-18 01:54:26,342,1666,

However, I recently called them for a quote for some plumbing at a rental I own, and they sent their plumber out to take a look. The plumber did not communicate well with me or my renter, and came back with a quote that I thought was at least 10% too high.  Not a huge deal, but when I looked at the detail, I noticed he wanted to put a big hole in my wall to access some pipes that I didn't think needed to be touched.  Not wanting to be an ""armchair quarterback"" I called my father-in-law who's a really handy guy.  He looked at pictures, and said he was pretty sure I didn't need the hole in my wall, and at the very least it could be much smaller.  Ok ... I'm still being patient at this point, and humble enough to admit what I don't know. So I called the office to discuss the details, and get more info.  The lady said she'd have the plumber call me.  A week later: no call.  So I tried again.  I reached the same lady and reminded her of the issue.  She seemed mildly annoyed, and passed the responsibly off on the plumber.  ""I told him to call.  I'll tell him again.""  Weeks later, I called another plumber to get the job done.  Poor customer service even if I assume they know their plumbing.  Sadly, I can't recommend this place, and will look for a 4-5 star handy service when I need help in the future.",2021-01-03 19:22:03,320,1405,

I agreed but advised High Tech Collision that I would transport the car to All American Auto Body shop. The service advisor asked me to give him an hour to put the car back together and I agreed.

Least) and $300 to fix. 

Here's the thing: Hawthorne has come out more than once to my place and generally is able to fix what they need to. The people they send are usually nice, courteous, what have you. This time, however, was different. About a year ago I had a leak in my bathroom that they came out to fix and they let us know that eventually the whole bathroom would need to be redone because of the pipes. No problem. So back in November of 2020 the leak starts up again and is getting worse fast, so we call Hawthorne out to set up something more permanent. They come out, do not fix the leak, and sign me up for a $4500 remodel of our tub and shower. Why didn't they fix the leak? Who knows but a few weeks later it's no longer a leak, the hot water won't shut off at all and there is a risk of my bathroom flooding--call Hawthorne again and they come out and fix it in less than an hour. The tech again explains that an entire remodel needs to be done, I agree and say I already set up financing, bada bing bada boom. 

We finally get someone out last Friday to do ""at max a day and a half to get everything done."" Not ideal, but no worries, as long as I have a working shower as soon as possible! So day one comes to an end (all the while I'm in the next room hearing the tech go ""this is a nightmare"" ""that's not going to work"" and calling someone to come help him because ""I've never done this before--I'll give
you the job, just please come help me this is too much for me man"") and the tech--who is very nice, just unprepared--tells me that it isn't done. Why? Because the replacement tub insert that he brought (which, by the way, I have never seen or approved previous to the installation, which I should have checked on granted, but also you'd think that a professional would have made sure it was approved BEFORE installation) doesn't fit so he had to TEAR APART MY CEILING in order to fit it. Oh but they don't do drywall, so I'll have to call another contractor that they work with all the time to fix it. 

Day two comes and he and another tech finish what they need to do, check for leaks (they found one and presumably fix it) and leave. My husband and I call my father in law who was a contractor (mostly carpentry but also plumbing and landscaping) for 40 years comes to fix
our drywall so we have a working shower. He's PISSED. Apparently the tub was put in incorrectly, which led to a 1.5 inch gap between the tub and the tile, which he estimates will cost 200-400 to fix since we have to go buy new tile to fill the gap. They also cut through the fire wall between our unit and the one next to us and installed the faucet and spout incorrectly, which may lead to rust problems. He calls them, talks to the supervisor who agrees to send out his guys again, and that brings us to today. After talking together they agree with my
Father in law to fix the problems (which he also agrees to help them with) and he leaves to go get supplies. The tech then comes to me and says Just kidding, we aren't doing anything and now I have to go to another job. I then confronted the tech about how this was all caused by a lack of him communicating with me, which he agreed to, but did not fix. 

This is just unacceptable. I feel like they took advantage of my lack of technical knowledge and then refused accountability when confronted. Now my father in law is fixing it himself (we would have had him do it the first
time but he just had back surgery) and I have to pay another $200-$400 for fixing my tile. What a waste.",2021-01-11 19:58:00,821,3650,

I have been a longtime fan of Barrio Bread and the Charro restaurants, so I knew that their combined talents would produce something particularly special. I was absolutely right! 

I got lunch from Barrio Charro today (their first day fully open to the public), and I am already thinking I'll get food from them at least twice more this week. First the space itself is lovely: bright, open, and airy. It has indoor seating and patio seating, as well as a small shop area with breads, tamales, sauces, and other pre-made products. 

Most importantly, the food is every bit as phenomenal as expected. I got the Pueblo Quesobirria Tortamano, and it was nothing short of heavenly! The sandwich is birria, queso oaxaca, frijoles, pico salsa & consommé dip on azteca bread. The birria was deeply flavorful and rich, with that perfect sweet-savory spice. I savored every bite, and licked my fingers (and the wrapper) when I was done. The chips that came with the torta were great as well -- and that's coming from someone who's not usually a fan of potato chips! These chips are mesquite BBQ, and were a great crunchy, smoky complement to the torta. The macaroni salad was also lovely, adding a cool, creamy contrast to the warm sandwich and salty chips. 

I was also very impressed with the service; despite the fact that there was a significant crowd, the staff were friendly, quick, and helpful. They had a good set-up to ensure social distancing was maintained, too. I was happy to see both Don Guerra and Ray Flores circulating among the patrons to chat about the menu, and once again was reminded how lucky we are to have them both here in Tucson. Their culinary talents are matched only by their kindness!

Prior service dept visits at two local dealerships yielded no explanation despite months of repeat visits and diagnostic charges.

With just 4 days before a return trip of 10 hours I called and my car was evaluated with 2 test drives and at least an hour or more of inspection on the rack.   My suspicion that front CV axle and joint was the source, a potential breakdown on the road and even loss of control during highway speed.   I was wrong.   The front joints were good and the age of the vehicle prompted recommendation for a though greasing and lubrication of the front suspension and wheel/axle parts was done. The expensive removal/replacement of CV joint/axle/boot was not necessary but could have been done and I would have paid an unnecessary high repair bill.   NO CHARGE  was collected for the time, trouble and effort for over an hour's work, on short notice.   I expected to pay the diagnostic charges, as is routine at the dealership.  The noise was nearly eliminated and confirmed by the mechanic's final test drive.  I was greatly relieved and finally felt confident that I would make the return drive without breakdown or severe accident.  

The service manager would not accept payment but rather welcomed me back for any future repairs or concerns.  I learned from return customers that it was the owner's first day of retirement while I was there.   I am sure hoping this review gets back to him.   Despite his absence,  his reputation of HONEST,  THOROUGH, ACCURATE AND TIME EFFICIENT SERVICE CONTINUES, EVEN WHILE HE IS AWAY. 

 The manager was friendly, professional and involved with each and every mechanic doing evaluation and repair.   The place was organized and busy.  Each customer was kept informed of the progress of their vehicle's repair.  I witnessed the art of professional auto repair like I've not seen in decades.  I thought personal auto care was a lost art due to the dominance of expensive dealerships.   At 68 years of age my faith in the local mechanic has been restored.  I and my daughter's family, both recently relocated to Tampa,  will certainly be back to Richard's Automotive service; simply the best as so many other reviews has stated !

As a newcomer to South Tampa that is floating back and forth between 2 states, I was searching for a place to not only have high quality workouts, but to seek new friends.  This place has it all -  welcoming front desk staff and a friendly manager (Katie). They also have incredibly talented instructors (Michaela, Liz, Andrea, Samantha, Nadia, Eunice) that provide high quality sessions with spot-on cueing and welcome you by name as you enter and ask how you've been.  They take the time to ask what your limitations are and provide coaching if you are struggling with movement.  I've even had instructors come to me after class and help me with things they noticed I was struggling with so as not to embarrass me during class.

I LOVE this place so much I purchased a Passport membership that allows me unlimited classes at South Tampa and anywhere else in the country.  Since I live in 2 states and traveled a bit for work, this was important to me.  Two and a half years later, I'm still a member and have hit nearly 800 classes.  As someone that has visited about a dozen Club Pilates locations, I can tell you that I've been very spoiled by the South Tampa location.  It's a beautiful studio with wonderful clients that feel like family so much so that it's hard to walk out the door at times!  Their instructors and the variety of classes they offer is by far superior to any other location I've attended.  Especially as someone that has taken as many classes as I have, I can say I've never been bored.  They offer more variety or more advanced classes than any other location I've visited.

As I've reviewed other reviews that provide some poor feedback on instructors from CP South Tampa, I can tell this studio has taken the feedback to heart and have acted upon it.  So don't let past reviews about brash or bored instructors looking at their phone detract you - that person is no longer there.  This studio listens to their clients.",2021-01-08 18:35:28,414,2049,

It's definitely not the grandest of most amazing architectursl wonder of the world but it has a variety of offerings that provide plenty to discover and explore along with something for everyone.

It has one the most fun playground with a lil tyke area and an older area with wonderful nautical amd pirate ship touches. Lots to climb. Wooden and terrific. 

There are various public art and mural installations. I liked the red oragami style pelican the best with realist red pelican statuary on top and adjacent nearby. Prime spot for a photo. The giant net hanging installation is... Interesting. It wasn't undulating or really doing anything much of anything when we were there, but I think it may move? And it would be fun to see it illuminated at night.

The food offerings as of 2021 vary from a snow cone, hot chocolate, and corn dog cart to piña coladas on the rooftop couches with empanada and other light bites fare. Not cheap for sure but service and execution was solid if not prompt. There are also some tiki features that are fun. And the views are terrific. There's also a stone oven pizza area and another bar / food spot I think nearer the beginning of the pier. And the rest of town is nearby as well of you wamt to wander.

The Busch Gardens / Univseral Studios style shuttle is fun especially with lil ones or the older set. They also point out the highlights of each stop on the pier so you can browse before you buy.. It is a lil exhausty especially toward the back. Where's Elon Musk when you need him?

The midway station has a $5 per person mini aquatic museum with touch tanks. We skipped it this visit but did see some nice sized fish walking the pier perimeter. There also a nice urban beach area. And some covereed and oncovered lawns. 

The 70 step parking by plate system was functional. $2 per hour and then $3 and $4 an hour additional because the longer your stay they more expensive you pay.

One additional bonus feature I have to mention is the Looper Trolley bus that stops at the very beginning of the pier. It does a leisurely 30 minute or so wandering loop through downtown with some good sites and our driver gave us a good tour with the highlights explained. He also returned the sunglasses one of my forgetful relatives left behind!!! All free of charge so you better dig deep and tip you cheapskate. It's $2 an hour just to park.. 

Lovely water views, airport views, marina views, and views looking back on St. Pete and across the Bay to Tampa. Def worth a visit and pretty well executed all around. I wouldn't be surprised to see additions and improvements going forward.

There's also fishing at the very end. So sunning, eating, art intaking, imbibing, fresh airing, airport watching, marina viewing, relaxing, reading, people watching, leisurely bike riding or roller blading, touristing, and partying are all covered.",2021-01-21 21:37:40,588,2911,

Our party of 2 unfortunately arrived a little late for our 5pm on a Saturday reservation and were told bar seating was available. We were understanding since we were admittedly behind schedule and only interested in drinks and appetizers as it was. 

Quickly the bar filled up with other patrons who had made no attempts at reservation and they audibly were NOT as understanding.

I know times are different but I'm baffled as to why every other table has to be sectioned off and exclusively for reservations but we were quickly elbow to elbow on each side of the bar with complete strangers. That doesn't sound socially distanced to you does it? 

The bartenders were understandably busy and hard to catch at times but our drinks stayed full and our need mostly met. 

The champagne, red wine and white wine we tried were excellent. The wine list was extensive and I enjoyed seeing many specialty drinks being served as well. 

As far as food we ordered the goat cheese appetizer, wonderful and the meatballs, decent. 

My friend ordered the chicken fettuccine and enjoyed it although it looked pretty dry for my liking.

The Rosemary focaccia and dipping oil served as a starter was a really nice touch.

All in all for drinks and appetizers, one entree and no dessert we spent well over $100 so I can't imagine this becoming a regular spot but definitely wonderful for a night out, with a reservation of course, or a great spot to grabs drinks.

It is COVID times right now so tonight I called to make a take-out order. A woman answered and when I said I'd like to place an order, her first response was ""OK you know we close at 10 [PM]?"" I was not aware of that but I checked my clock and I was calling at 9:15 PM so surely that shouldn't be a problem for a small take-out order, right? When I continued with my order she sounded very annoyed and hung up without confirming anything to me. I wasn't even sure when to come or if she got my whole order.

So I showed up about 20 minutes later, 9:40-ish. They were already cleaning and locking the doors, and as I entered, an employee who was leaving was VERY concerned about my presence and made sure I was just getting take-out, which I confirmed. Then when I got to the counter to get my food and pay for it, the woman ""helping"" me was very curt and annoyed. She handed me my bill and when I pulled out my debit card she said, ""You don't have cash? Cash. Cash!""

After my first review I was contacted by the owner of this establishment in a very professional manner. He offered to have me back in and give it another go with the feeling that it was apparently a very off night the first time.

I appreciate the invite and I've just finished a repeat of my first meal. Way better the second time around.

Totally different meal.

The ribs were much better. Not nearly as salty, really nice pink smoke throughout. Good tangy sauce to cut it. Sauce wasn't even necessary though. The meat was pretty good on its own. Meat pulled off the bone nicely. If anything a little too easily, but really good taste. 3 3/4 to 4 stars on this one.

The brisket was night and day. This one was excellent. Really good well-developed smoke. Coffee rub was tasty. Meat was cut properly. Approximately half inch thick slices with a good moisture and spring and a nice tooth. Perfect is really tough so I can't say perfect but I'd give it at least 4 1/2 maybe four and three-quarter stars. Very good brisket. Definitely recommend it.

Sweet potato fries were edible this time which is a big step. LOL. Liked the jalapeño aioli they were served with. Nice complement. They were slightly overcooked and not really crunchy but they were good. Three stars there.

Coleslaw was way better this time. Threw some onion in there, and a really nice sweet sauce. Well blended. Well shredded. Yummy. Four stars.

Baked beans were cooked even better this time but may be a little bit too vinegary. They were pretty darn tangy. Still good. I'd say three and three-quarter stars for those. Flavor actually wasn't quite as good as the first time which I thought was awesome.  I do like the smoky complement of meat they put in there

Baked mac & cheese this time, totally different planet. Last time it wasn't baked. This time it was served in an aluminum tray and was clearly oven baked with a layer of cheese on top. Perfect blend. Really yummy cheese. Great creaminess. Good noodles. Top-notch mac & cheese. Almost as good as making it myself. Five stars.

Sauce It was really good this time. Not too salty at all. Really nice vinegary tang which cut through the smoke and richness. Great balance. 4 1/4 stars.

All in all I'm impressed. Definitely will try again now...And if quality stays consistently like this will become one of two places I'll go to in the suburbs.

Thank you to ownership for standing up for your business doing the right thing and caring about your product. I gladly update my review to a much more positive status",2021-01-14 23:13:04,527,2558,

After searching and searching for months I applied for what was listed as a ""7 y/o Shih Tzu."" They claimed she was house trained and was an elderly owner surrender from a high kill shelter. I applied, within days my references were called. Both of my references reported only being asked if they thought I was a responsible pet owner and how long the dog would be alone a day, both calls less than 60 seconds. My vet references were never checked and almost immediately I was called and hustled into a next day transport. I was connected with the foster mom who they had claimed had her for a month, she reported the same...""sweet girl, house broken, and 7 y/o who had been vetted and was up to date on shots."" Fast forward to the cost...I get an invoice for $1100!!! I could not believe that price for a dog of that age but at that point we were already in love so I agree. I am then told they only accept PayPal friends and family...anyone who shops online knows this is a HUGE red flag. I let them know I would not pay unless it was protected through goods and services particularly that sum of money and I would not be adopting. They finally agree. We get there to get her...immediately notice she is definitely a mutt of some sort with extremely bowed front legs (poor girl), appears younger than 7 and is infested with fleas. Within 2 days of having her home she has 2 seizures. Off to an emergency vet we go. Testing and scans deduced that she had a seizure disorder and low and behold was only 4 years old. In reviewing her records that came with her with the vet she had not had any shots or anything until the day I committed to adopting her despite having been fostered for a month. We've had her now for 3 months and she is impossible to house train (just another lie) and this past weekend had to take her to Cornell ER for what we now know is a bladder tumor. I am now $3k deep in a dog that is truly the sweetest thing but not at all what was portrayed. I thank God every day she got lucky enough to be with folks who are willing to make this commitment both financially and in caring for her. This has been a very hard lesson and I really should have trusted my gut! Even if they didn't know any of her health concerns I would still be concerned with the amount of money charged and the little checking they did on my application. DO NOT adopt from this ""rescue!"" I do not believe for a minute they are a true non-profit.

Copied and pasted from a google review that I also wrote today, if you have a minute go take a look at the extremely passive aggressive and blame shifting response they posted immediately. Claiming that adopting a ""high risk dog from out of state"" was clearly not my best choice...The problem with that is the health conditions were NEVER disclosed!",2021-01-06 04:45:12,598,2828,

We were notified on the app that it is $27/per night for parking. Now it is $35 and get this, weekend guests can now only have one car per room. So forget if you've been here all week. You have to find a place to park late at night on your own. And if you're lucky, you can park on the side of the road until 8am. Then-well-who knows what you can do? Not hotel management!  Also no supervisor or manager on site at night. Management left their staff to fend for themselves with no alternative plan for guests to park or solutions.
There was no warning or policy on the hotel site, reservation or at check in. 
The former Hilton parking lot is now under construction. There wasn't a notice on the app (as most Hilton's Give policy and service change updates) that there will be construction going on during the stay. It is so loud and the entire hotel was shaking terribly. We are very high up and I was very concerned for a while. 

Oh, to top it off there is only 1 of 3 elevators working. Guests are cramming into the one elevator because of 15-20 minute waits for the elevator. Guests aren't allowed to use the stairs as it isn't an emergency. What happens when the last elevator breaks down? You cannot safely or comfortably stay here. Guests are prancing around in the lobby and elevators maskless and drinking so ""they're exempt from wearing a mask.""
The previous hotel review made me laugh because their AC unit sounds just like ours in the room. The room Phone is broken too. 
No special treatment for Hilton honors members either-while it isnt important-I have to add that there wasn't a welcome water bottle and continental breakfast is a muffin and bottle of water to pick up at front desk. Wow. Even that little touch could have helped. 
We have stayed at this hotel every year since 2016 and I've never seen such unpreparedness and bad business in a hotel. At first, I was disappointed and let COVID be the excuse until the parking debacle. That was it.
The poor hotels condition and management deserves 0 stars. Im giving two stars only for the staff-not management. I think the staff deserve a pat on the back for being so nice despite their managers leaving them to deal with this. 
We are dreading the morning and the rest of our stay. I really hope we don't get sick.",2021-01-16 05:47:41,508,2454,

Tampa was next on my check list of zoos and it certainly didn't disappoint. BUT note that this is a popular zoo and it does get crowded! I was surprised to find such a long line for ticket purchase. Luckily they had many employees working and the line moved quickly. 

Hot selling point is the current special ""Buy a Day"" ticket. If you purchase one regular ticket, you can return any day for free! There are some blackout dates though. But such a great deal! And for those noting that this zoo is expensive.. yes it is a bit pricier than your average small zoo. So why is a zoo this size charging more for admission than the Bronx? Simple. This zoo offers an array of amusement rides that are available with your general admission ticket. If you are less than enthused about the price and/or the rides, check out a different zoo. There are several within less than two hours. 

Anyhow, I was enthusiastic to visit the zoo behind the popular series ""Secrets of The Zoo"". My enthusiasm wasn't without cause. Despite its size. ZooTampa has a great collection of animals. The grounds are beautiful and the habitats carefully maintained. Everything is grouped by region so locating your favorite animals is fairly simple. Although-the signage could be better. Not a huge deal. Just download the map on your phone prior to entry. 

Upon trekking throughout the different habitats, I was delighted to meet with several keepers and volunteers. They made the experience memorable with their wealth of information. I really enjoyed speaking with volunteer, Jim in the manatee exhibit! 

All around a great zoo and a fun visit. Only thing I wished I could have done was the ""Expedition Africa"" tram ride. The line was unbelievably long due to only one team running. Over an hour wait! Seems like a zoo with this kind of popularity should run additional vehicles and keep lines moving but maybe next time. The animals were visible on foot just fine! I also wish that covid protocols were stricter but being outdoors with room for distance made me feel safe. 

Free and ample parking and ability to return for free with my day ticket!",2021-01-02 16:28:35,428,2171,

Easy enough order, right? I didn't ask for any extras, no special requests and yet my order still came out wrong and the pasta dish had to be remade. Which left my husband and I sitting there with our pizza (now getting cold) and our server no where to be found. I had to flag her down so we could get plates to eat our pizza. She had attitude from the very beginning of our meal and my husband and I couldn't figure out why. Several of her tables appeared unhappy with her as well. My pasta dish which took forever to come out of the kitchen the first time, arrived a few minutes later, and it was the smallest $15 pasta dish I've ever ordered. It was so incredibly bland and soupy we did not enjoy it at all. I don't know if it would have been any better had they not rushed it out of the kitchen. I would have asked for salt and pepper or anything really, but miss attitude was MIA. And the house bread was stale and so dry!

I have been here at least 8 times for laser and the female doing that is great. But my last visit made me so frustrated and ultimately I won't get new services now. I signed in and was given papers when I said I was there BOTOX, I filled out waivers after saying I was there for BOTOX, they have specials posted for BOTOX, pricing for BOTOX, and I get in the room and say I want BOTOX, the woman said oh no we don't do BOTOX.(Not they were out of it, just they don't do that)  I point to the sign she's next to that says they sell BOTOX‍ Also frustrating - they promised me I would be out in ample time- I didn't mind booking a different time but they said it'll be fine- it wasn't.

Update: Cynthia called me to tell me well my appointment was for Dysport, which I said no I called for Botox. Cynthia continued to interrupt me when I was talking and told me she would refund for the laser session i had remaining. She kept telling me her perspective. I'm glad she got that across.

I submitted my application for a cat and was called the next day. The site also stated that they were currently waiving all adoption fees on adult cats but I was charged a ""choose your own price kitten adoption"" fee for my adult cat a fee they instead chose themselves. When they called it was a ""now or never"" situation; they wanted immediate payment or I'd have to reapply,refused to hold the cat for 1 day as I wasn't prepared for things to move that fast,refused to let me meet the animal first reassuring me if I don't keep him they'd take him back and refund within a month, I adopted on a holiday and was giving a 24hr pet insurance deal that wasn't honored because I adopted dec30, he had just been treated for tapeworms 3 days prior to adoption they told me zero about his health history or temperament and when I called to find out if he needed follow up care for the tapeworms instead of saying yes ,no and or when they got mad and said they would adopt out an animal with an active health issue and to put the icing on the cake my beautiful 1.5 year old boy might actually really be my beautiful 9 year old girl; a suspicion that arose online shopping for him/her for a cat harness when I read a review with a picture of an identical cat with the same name,and markings calling her a 10lb 7 year old girl (review was two years old as of today.) So a best they don't honor their own claims and at worst they might withhold all info on an animal until after you pick up your adoption and might even be dishonest about it entirely and even defensive if you ask about follow up care about previous health issues; either way I love my little boy or old lady and wouldn't trade him or her for the world.

Such a simple modifier and they completely missed it. Another time they gave us the completely wrong order!!! How do you mess up that badly??? I sent photo evidence to uber eats (because one of the orders was placed through them) and I didn't get my money back. Money absolutely wasted. Gross food too. 
Secondly, it is hard enough to deal with the fact that taco bell has cut their entire menu in HALF, but somehow they're still removing popular items from the menu to the point that whatever is left anymore is all the same stuff. The last straw was last night when my boyfriend wanted the only thing he liked from Taco Bell that was even left anymore: The grilled cheese burrito. They removed it. Now there's nothing left on the menu that he likes. Why on earth is Taco Bell cutting down their menu so much??? I highly doubt its for financial reasons. I've never seen any Taco Bell not have customers in line. You do know you're driving customers away by doing this, right?? It makes no sense.

Right away one notes the upscale yet convivial decor and soothing, dim lighting. We were initially greeted by cheerful staff who ensured we had access to the aux in the room for music and everything anything else we needed.

Before sunset, we were able to take some photos on the back patio, which we entered into through a door located right inside the private dining room. We ordered cocktails right away, and loved all of them. The painkiller comes in an adorable peacock mug topped with fresh fruit which several friends enjoyed. I got two rounds of the fire starter, which was a wonderfully made, simple drink that proved refreshing yet effective in getting the party started for me personally!

Four of us one one end of the table opted to share appetizers in an effort to try many different things while also reducing cost. The brussel sprouts were delicious, mixed with pomegranate seeds and a decadent sauce. The octopus tacos were amazing, with the octopus itself cooked to perfection. They came on a crispy shell, topped with avocado and pickled onions. We also ordered corn fritters which were paired with a perfect zatar sauce. I was not a fan of the carrots as the coffee notes were a bit too strong for me. However, the watermelon tuna salad was absolutely incredible! 

We also split the sweet potato gnocchi entree between 4 people. I must say we were collectively disappointed by the dish as a whole, but it could be because none of us eat vegan. I would think someone who is deprived of the unmatched flavors that animal products provide might like this as it included strong barbecue essences, maybe to mimic a smoky meat flavor? Feel free to comment your thoughts on that, vegans.

The tiramisu was creamy, but the layers inside were a bit too papery and sort of difficult to chew. The quatro leches cake was pretty good but to me, nothing to write home about.

I know Flor Fina is quite new, and overall I enjoyed the experience. The bar looked cool and inviting, and will definitely be back soon to enjoy some drinks bar-side. I look forward to revisiting the restaurant soon to get another taste of what they are offering!",2021-01-25 20:21:00,444,2286,

However, after staying at the property that was about twice what the room was worth.

We have stayed at Baymont by Wyndham properties in the past and this property by the airport in Tucson does not live up to the other properties that we've stayed at.

. This property is very tired looking and really needs a good rehab. The room we had had a king bed, which was comfortable. The room on the other hand, needed some help. The walls are painted they have a beige Navajo white looking wallpaper. There were stains on the wallpaper and like small holes and cuts. I don't know if somebody went crazy when they got their bill and decided to stay at the wall with a pain, but it just looked weird.

There are signs by the sink not to get the towels dirty. Well isn't that the whole point of towels? I mean if you get dirty you wash up and then you wipe your hands or whatever on the towel and sometimes towels get dirty. Kind of makes me worried if they don't want me to touch the towels and get them dirty are they even cleaning anyting during this whole pandemic?

Then the woman at the front desk the morning of check out was about as courteous and warm as a cactus. First off, while she said the right words there was no meaning behind those words. There was no warm, there was no welcoming, it was more like how can I help you, but what she really was saying was like why are you effing bothering me?

I know this hotel chain is Infamous for not only keeping your security deposit, which in this case was around $50, but they love to find other things wrong in the room to charge you for that as well. So, I decided I would try to beat them at their own game. I asked for someone to check out my room and verify that it was left in good condition so that I could get my deposit back.

Miss Congeniality at the front desk, her real name is Mehak, first tells me there's no one that can check out the room to confirm that it's in good condition. At that point I had seen several maids and she tells me that the maids aren't qualified to verify that the room is in good condition. Early, will then who checks out the room? Mehak proceeds to tell me that the only person on the property that can verify that a room is in good condition upon checkout is the housekeeping manager. Who by the way is conveniently not on the property. Apparently she's pregnant and was it a doctor's appointment and would be in later today to verify that the rooms are in good condition. 

So I'm guessing since the rooms go up to at least 332 that there's at least 150 rooms in the hotel because I think they numbered every other number and anyways you're going to tell me that the only person in the building that can tell that a room is of the proper quality is the housekeeping manager. 

Guess I'll also be calling Corp about this incident. Don't bother staying here if you have a chice.",2021-01-02 18:44:37,638,3018,

Not great.  We're not small dudes.   5 guys crowded at a high top for a nice steak.   Host should know that fellas want to spread out...perhaps at a table. Then, the server missed a few simple requests, some of which we simply waived (a beer that was ordered but didn't come) and a few he had to be reminded of more than once.

One guy's 21-day was overdone, as the attentive manager agreed, and one guy's was undercooked to which they had to return to the grill.   The overdone guy's steak was remade swiftly and without asking, comped.   A very nice gesture indeed.   Mine was simply great but the conversation about how a steakhouse should get it right, when they did not, overtook the experience and commandeered our exchange.

The building installed dog turf on 1st avenue. In theory this was an amazing idea however they building does not clean it and it is covered in feces. Several dogs in the building have become extremely ill and their vets have said it is because of the bacteria on the turf and not to let the dogs use it because it is not properly cleaned. 

The garbage chute backs up every weekend and garbage overflows into the garbage chute room on many of the floors. See photos. The smell in the hallways is sometimes unbearable from the smell of trash. We have been getting more bugs in our apartment now because of it.   This has been going on for months and I've complained multiple times. The last time I called I was told they were doing the best they could. 

In order to have maintenance fix anything in your apartment you have to put in a request online. My last three requests have gone unanswered for almost 2 months. I went to the leasing office multiple times as well as stopped the maintenance people in the hallway and it still took that long to be acknowledged. 

Last weekend the building sprung a new charge on us for cooling the common areas of the building. The leasing manager said there was an addendum in the lease. Many residents along with myself have a lease that does not have that addendum therefore legally we don't have to pay it. I was told today they are consulting with their legal team and I have to pay it or I'll receive a late fee. I am not able to pay it through our app. I emailed the leasing manager a week ago to ask how to pay it and no response. I'd expect the legal team to take months to give us an answer just like everything else. 

The mail room has a new fob system because many residents were finding their packages stollen. Now UPS and FedEx is having difficulty getting into the building after the leasing office business hours. Last week UPS dropped all the packages off on 1st Ave because they couldn't get in the building because the building won't give them fobs. 

20% of the people in this building wear masks so it feels very unsafe. 

The bottom line is there are A LOT of issues in this building.  I thought they would have figured this all out by now but they haven't.  It is becoming more and more disappointing.",2021-01-14 16:54:24,469,2352,

I was told I would receive a text on Thursday with a time for delivery on Friday. No text Thursday. No dishwasher Friday. I called Friday to find out where the dishwasher was. I spoke to a woman in the delivery department. She denied every making arrangements for the dishwasher to be delivered on Friday??? Okay.  So we made new arrangements.   I asked her to double check my contact information.  I SPECIFICALLY ASKED HER TO UPDATE MY CELL PHONE NUMBER IN THE COMPUTER SO THERE COULD BE NO FUTURE MISTAKES ON DELIVERY. I heard the sound of a keypad typing. She said she updated my information. I asked her to read my cellphone number back to me. She did so correctly. 

We agreed I would receive a text next Thursday giving me a window for delivery next Friday.  Thursday rolls around. Driver shows up while I am in Zoom business meeting. No text, no nada. WDC denies having received either call from me.  I check call records on my cell phone - all calls are documented on my end.

Bottom line - they will do things on their schedule and they will not abide by any representations they make to you. Why do you care? Because when the dishwasher is dropped off, you have to inspect it. If you accept delivery and later find a fault you are stuck.  There are many levels at which this is true. Basically, you want to be prepared to receive, inspect, and install within a reasonable time from receipt (so you can be sure it works) the dishwasher.  This impromptu delivery system actively interferes with your ability to do so.  THIS is why you don't buy from WDC. If they are this disorganized about their delivery shedule can you imagine how disorganized the rest of their business is?  How careful are they with your credit card information?

So we both ordered 2 tacos, but she also wanted a menudo. I got me a pozole. While waiting they brought us some salsa and chips, we waited about 5-7 Minutes for the tacos to arrive. We began eating and our first bite was just pure salt, now let me tell you all; I completely understand we all have different tastebuds, and I wasn't alone on this one I usually don't like a lot of salt on my food , however my friend in the other hand she likes salty foods. When I tell you she told me what did I just bite into? She tried the tortilla by its self and, she said the tortillas are fine, she then tries the meat and boy she then calls the girl who took our order and tells her, this is just too salty like try it, she said oh no, I'm truly sorry I'll get you a fresh new tacos, she had brought us the Menudo & the pozole. We took a sip same damn thing pure salt it tasted as if the dumped a whole bag worth of 10lbs of salt. I don't know for others it might taste delicious but for us it was completely something we could just not enjoy the salt was just really over powdering the meal. We then get our new tacos and when I tell you I felt bad I try to chug that taco down it was still just very overpowering with salt like that meat was basically just sitting and marinating in salt. Unfortunately we did not eat any of the food we paid and told the lady we know it's not your fault, but you should definitely suggest the cook or who ever is in charge to try this food and rearrange how it's prepared... That's one side of the story, so couple years has passed since I went there with my friend well my parents decided they wanted something from here, so they ordered a Menudo a caldo de pescado (fish soup) and some tacos, this is during the pandemic of Covid 19. They had ordered through UberEats. The food came well packaged but when I tell you I said OK maybe they were just having a bad day that time I went with my friend let me give it a shot again, well I take the first bite to my taco, again? like I said in the beginning I completely understand that we all have different taste buds, but I was also not alone because my dad loves his salt lol. But when he saw my face he then takes a sip of his menudo my mom as well they where like WOAH! This has way too much salt, I knew that it wasn't just me it's their food. I don't know if others have experienced this or not but after this I truly would not recommend anyone, nor suggest anyone to go to this restaurant I mean unless you like 10 pounds of salt on your food, then I say go for it.

My boyfriends mother wanted to hear ""Blackvelvet."" The singer said she didn't know it. Really?! Was really full of herself...what a joke! She wants $20 a song and ""she's never heard of Black Velvet?!"" Amateurs. So, the band sucked... Anyways, ""Drinking Problem"" came on, and my bf started dancing with me at our table. We weren't really ""dancing"" just kinda rocking in place, the bouncer came over and was a complete dick about it! First of all, we aren't from here. We don't know your stupid ass rules! Secondly, we were trying to be nice (for getting yelled at) and tried to laugh and smile, and said, ""okay, okay fine"" and not make a big deal. We were with family.. But The bouncer wouldn't crack a smile. He went on to talk amongst himself and bust out this long narrative about how ""these are the rules""  and we're 'making his job hard for him'..blah blah ..and how we will will be asked to leave if we can't comply. TOTALLY unnecessary and over the top! We didn't have a good time. Every bouncer in town kinda sucked actually. They hate their jobs, hate their lives, and HATE working Broadway.

She seemed fine after the first egg, two days later she was not acting herself. Started calling around to see a vet, her in Lompoc the bird vet was not taking clients... so we were calling everywhere frantically trying to get her in, the bird clinic in Pismo told us it wasn't an emergency and didn't have an opening until the following week. Finally found this Cat and Bird clinic and we are so greatful we did! It was so late in the day by the time we got in touch with them they couldn't get us in that day, but we got an appointment for the following day. Five minutes after Coco was taken back the vet called us with a plan to get started with which included a calcium shot and doing xrays. She was not egg bound which was our first concern, but she was and still is calcium deficient... the vet also saw that her heart might have some problems and before she did a final diagnosis needed to see the final radiology report which would be available the following day. We decided it was best for Coco to stay the night at the clinic and not have to travel twice from lompoc to Santa Barbara if they needed to do an ultrasound after the radiology report. The whole staff was so patient, kind and understanding. These were professionals that had never seen us or our animal prior to this but cared for her like she was one of their own! We are so thankful we found the Cat and Bird Clinic here on Mission street. Coco has a long road to recovery but after only two days she is slowly acting more like her silly self again.

When I stayed here, this place was a bed and breakfast. I was in the process of navigating a cross country move and was flying in from the SF Bay area for a weekend to look at housing. Since I don't drive (making car rental rather impractical) and the properties my realtor wanted me to see were all in Northwest Philly, it seemed prudent to find lodging outside Center City. This place came up when I Googled accommodations in the area (very slim pickings) so my thought was it made sense to look into booking a stay.

As I write I'm shaking my head and hearing my late mother's voice warning me that 'coming events cast their shadows...' Yes, Mom, they do. 

First red flag-one of the inn keepers (for lack of a better title) did not want to communicate by phone, only by e-mail. Well, okay. I'm not really thrilled with phone conversations so I went along. Problem was that I had a deadline as I had a flight booked and paid for and appointments with 2 realtors and the proprietess was slow to respond to email. When she did, she asked a lot of questions that were just a little too personal for my taste; however, I figured this was just for a weekend and reminded myself to stop being a ninny. I decided on a room and was given a rate that was not exorbitant. I said I could pay by Paypal. No, she did not want that. Check? Well, maybe that was okay but she really preferred a credit card, so I asked if there was an online portal where I could pay. NO. Ooooookay then, could I call and give her my credit card. No. It had to be emailed and she would get back in touch via email when the transaction was approved. *sigh* 

By now, I was getting down to the wire as far as time went and I was ready to just say 'screw it' and book at a chain hotel in Center City when Joan finally got back to me, saying everything was approved and she looked forward to meeting me. 

My connecting flight from Chicago to Philadelphia was cancelled due to a blizzard and I was stuck in the airport, not sure when I would be able to reschedule a flight. Once more, since I could not call my hostess, I had to sit in the airport and anxiously play the email game. I said I would be arriving LATE and would telephone her when I was close to Manayunk. 

Fortunately I was able to get another flight out with only a few hours delay but that brought me into Philly after 10 p.m. Several cabbies at the PHL airport would not take me as a passenger, stating they had 'no idea' where my destination (Manayunk) was. I finally got a ride with a sympathetic driver who also pleaded ignorance of the location of my bed and breakfast though he was game to get me there (and yes, I tipped him VERY well when he dropped me off) and he did. Of course, by then, it was close to midnight and I feared I'd be sleeping on the steps of the B & B in the cold. I took a chance and called them and to my shock, the phone was answered. I was given a code to the security lock outside and another code to the lock on my room. Breaching the inner sanctum, I found a warm, nicely appointed room and turned in for the night. 

With all the hassle of traveling and the time difference, I slept poorly and my rest was disturbed by a lot of thumping, bumping and odd noises overhead. I learned that the owners of the place lived upstairs and they were 'experimenting with an invention to be previewed on Shark Tank, so pardon the noise!' This, too, was conveyed by email. When I finally awoke the next morning, I started to search for the promised breakfast that came with the cost of my room. I was told (via email) that a 'long term lodger' lived adjacent to my room and had full use of the kitchen/dining room and its contents, but I was 'welcome to eat and drink whatever looked like was not being consumed by the other guest.' I opted to have brunch with my realtor instead of playing a guessing game and left for the day.

Upon my return, I was unable to get into my room with the code I'd been given. Once again, the emailing commenced and I was given a new code with no explanation of why the original code had been changed. My room was nicely cleaned and made up. Weary of all that had gone before, I opted for an early night. Again, I was disturbed by the Shark Tank shenanigans over head until the wee hours.

By the next day, I'd had enough so I emailed my hostess that I was checking out. She responded with a lot of inappropriate questions about my stay (which I ignored) and apologized for not meeting me face to face. Her excuse was that she had alopecia and did not feel like putting on her wig and coming downstairs to welcome me or talk in person. Okay. 

I again opted not to paw through someone else's comestibles for something that did not look 'used' to satisfy my morning hunger,  packed my small satchel, literally ran out of there and made a fast trot to the train station down the hill, happy to be away from this bizarre bed and breakfast.",2021-01-09 20:28:16,1067,4954,

My boyfriend took me here because he tried their signature Agaves Burrito a couple years back when he visited and it was one of the most memorable meals from that trip. Let me say, the food here did not disappoint. We decided to treat ourselves and ordered 3 entrees, and our order came with the usual complimentary chips with 4 different types of sauces (red sauce, green sauce, pico de gallo, and a darker salty sauce I'm not familiar with!)

Agaves Burrito: They drenched that thing in their amazing chipotle sauce. It came with a side of rice and salad. You never usually expect much out of a side salad, but this one was actually pretty good! It had dried cranberries, tangerines, corn- and all the flavors worked very well together. As for the burrito itself, the fillings definitely were not distributed very well (one end of the burrito was all lettuce, and the other end was all the good stuff like shrimp/fish/guac,) but altogether it was very delicious.

Mole Enchiladas: All their sauces are a hit, and the mole is no exception. It has that beautiful smoky sweetness, and came with a side of rice and beans. 

Chile Poblano Campestre: Looks-wise, not really sure what it is the way they presented it, but eating it was delicious! The description lists it as 2 corn tortillas with a poblano chile stuffed with meat and cheese, but in reality it was more like they cut the chile in half and flattened it, then put a layer of meat and cheese on top.",2021-01-10 08:21:33,303,1473,

I still live here and I regret extending my lease just about every day!!

They make you pay for a parking space, there isn't enough spaces for residents and guests. they say they have a tow company that comes around, they don't.

They make you pay extra for it to be a gated community and the gates have been broken for the last 2 years.

Their maintenance staff knows jack all about anything. They don't answer emergency requests until the next day. If they do come out, they're rude, and they huff and puff over you asking them to do their job...You could put a regular request in and you wouldn't hear back for at least a couple days. Then they blame you and make it seem like it's your fault things don't work.

If your a/c stops working, they say ""well, the best I can do is come by tomorrow afternoon"" even if it's 90 degrees in your apartment and you call at a reasonable hour.

Their appliances are out of date and falling apart. If the sink clogs, maintenance says ""well, this is an apartment complex, what do you expect"". If your dryer isn't drying your cloths, they say ""well, stop washing cloths so often"".

They don't have a regular garbage pick up so it just piles up and makes the whole surrounded area smell. Then they issue emails and written statements telling residents to ""stop producing so much waste"" and tell us how it's against the rules to have garbage outside our apartment when there is nowhere else to put full bags of garbage.

Nobody is ever in the office to help, they don't have enough staff and the ones who ""work"" are always out of the office.

This complex had been bought by numerous entities and each one is worse than the next.

My suggestion, think about being homeless before you rent one of these apartments. They've increased rent with no changes to anything people have been complaining about for years! Just read the other reviews! It's got a 3 star rating and it hasn't gone up since I moved in 3 years ago...

It's on me for renewing my lease for sure, but that's only because the house I was trying to purchase fell through. Wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy.

They don't care because they know fools like me will choose to live here because they can't see past the aesthetic and location... believe me, as soon as I can. I am ooooooot!",2021-01-25 04:10:01,500,2322,

Back in June, a friend of mine posted a live story to Instagram with what appeared to be the most appetizing ""dip your taco"" experience. He tagged a small pop-up with only a few hundred followers - they were popped up for the afternoon in a backyard - and I just had to get out there and try for myself. The small pop-up was Yona Redz, and it's been a real pleasure watching their business grow to over 5k followers and a storefront in just a few months' time. 

When I arrived at the location, the line was easily 30 people long. Completely worth the wait. I ordered the ""Yona Special"" which my friend had posted to his Instagram, and it certainly lived up to the hype. Three tacos loaded with birria meat, cheese and a dipped tortilla fried to perfection, along with a cup of au jus-style consommé which is provided for you to dip the tacos into. I did just that and the flavor combination was out of this world. One of the best things I'd ever tried. The perfect flavor, the perfect crisp, the perfect portion. So very delicious. 

This is a true local's success story as this pop-up has evolved into a legit storefront, on one of the busiest blocks of State no less. They are open daily for take-out and you will still see the long lines. Trust me, though - worth it. 

Now is a very crucial time to support locally-owned businesses. I wholeheartedly recommend you try this awesome spot out!",2021-01-16 15:54:51,306,1463,

I had not moved back to the STL area yet, but my friends were raving about this restaurant and told me, ""You have to go try it when you are home!"" 
I delayed my visit until I permanently relocated back to the area in 2014. That was the year my taste buds fell in love with a dish that added more ""sway"" to my hips: ""The Kitchen Sink - Ultimate Shrimp & Grits"" created and perfected by Chef Anthony Ellerson, Jr. of the Kitchen Sink (St. Louis). Many of us ate his dishes multiple times until our hearts were broken in 2017 and the doors were closed on the last location, Downtown St. Louis. We thought 2018 was the year he would welcome us back with open arms, but it was not meant to be. We had a chance to have some of our favorites in October of 2019 at One Day Pop-Up. 

As the year 2021 begins so many of us are worn down and stressed due to living under the threat of the pandemic. So having Anthony cook for us was a absolute treat and the gift that some of us needed (I did). My favorite dish, ""The Kitchen Sink - Ultimate Shrimp & Grits"" is still my favorite. Anthony, I thank you!

A HUGE THANK YOU to Gourmet Soul.... We (yes, I speak for lots of us....LOL) are not sure how you convinced him to get in the kitchen, but we are grateful!  Judging from the amount of cars I saw pulling up today and way your staff was moving those orders out...DO NOT LET HIM OUT OF YOUR SIGHT!!!!

I had seven rooms of carpet to be cleaned + a head board that I was charged $90 dollars for . I was looking for a carpet cleaning service and because of my allergies I opted to get the carpet professionally done & not do it myself the 1st time. I wanted to go with a big company to insure that the job was done right, boy, I could not be more disappointed. Intially, while the carpet was still damp, I thought it was okay, more like,  it's fine & looks clean. Our home is new w/new carpet so it wasn't stained or anything like that we just wanted professionals to handle the cleaning. There was 1 guy sent 1 out of the 3 times and he was in & out in less than a hour which I thought was strange but I trusted him, after all, he is the professional. After this guy tried to sell us on deodorizer because he said that will be better with my allergies, we opted out of this option, tipped the guy & he left. Downhill from here, once the carpet dried it was hard, almost like it wasn't rinsed properly and we saw all the areas that he did not hit, now I see why he moved so quickly.I called Stanley Steamer and they had another crew out within hours, sounds good right? Nope, this was so bad, there were 2 guys this time, Hakeem & another guy that didn't give a name but Hakeem was the guy to worry about. From the time the crew came into my home Hakeem was yelling & talking to the guy like he wasn't a person, the problem began when Hakeem thought he would talk to me the same way and the same tone as he did his crew member. Every room he went into there was a problem & arguement or him saying that he couldn't reach a spot when the guy the day before got all those places but just did a horrible job. Before long I was tired of arguing and called stanley steamer to notify them of the constant disrespect and unprofessional behavior by the worker, I was told to just let him do what he wants & anything not done just call it in and they will have a manager out there next time, but don't argue with him. What! Ma'am this is my home and I will not shut up & be disrespected by anyone! It was time for them to leave at this point. While wrapping up the equipment, the guy that was being yelled at put the metal cleaner on my hardwood floor and scratches the floor, Hakeem immediately runs over and tells the guy to get out the house now "" I told you to be careful "" is what he says to the worker, mind you, the whole time I am on the phone with a representative as it was unfolding. Hakeem tried to put some kind of gloss over the scratches & said I don't see anything anymore let me take a picture, I said no and please leave my home I will handle this with corporate I just want you to leave, Hakeem then says"" I'm not going anywhere I want to take a picture of the gloss"" at this point I was already on the phone with a manager name Rob Harvey who heard the commotion. It got to the point where I told Hakeem to leave my home before I call the police and he said "" I don't care call them"" wtf? The whole time the manager is on the phone doing nothing but listening, eventually after taking my wife's phone to call the cops because he was now trespassing, he hurried and left out the home, once he saw I was serious. The next day Rob Harvey along with another manager came to my home to redo the whole carpet, take pictures and make excuses for why it may have seemed like Hakeem was yelling. Yes, they cleaned the carpet right this time with a lil extra treat of deodorizer & scotchgard, whoopie, and asked to leave a review. I was going to wait to leave the review until after they fixed the flooring but it's been 2 weeks and nothing has been done, just a lot of someone will reach out to you. I'll give him credit for having someone reach out but that was all it was, now we are having to wait yet again and go back and fourth with this company for them to fix a problem they caused.

I've eaten here three times now since they've opened. The first time, we sat at the bar and I enjoyed a cocktail that featured a Truly. I loved it! We ordered nachos and for my main dish, I got a burger. Both plates were underwhelming, but they had just opened so we planned to return a few months down the road.

We came back again a little after restaurants reopened from Covid. Again, the food (I got a chicken sandwich this go-round) was extremely mediocre. I decided I would try this place again once more for brunch to see if I'd like the food better from that menu.

Well, The worst is saved for last! Last Saturday, I came and ordered a mimosa ($8!!!) and was told afterwards that I could save 3 dollars by getting the champagne only. You're charging 3 dollars for a few drops of OJ in my mimosa...?! Next, my friend and I BOTH ordered the waffle & chicken Benedict. When it came out, the eggs were HARD. No runny egg what so ever, as poached eggs should be. Instead of taking our plates back, we were told to roll the (basically) hard boiled eggs off our plate and we would get new ones. Everything was, as you would imagine, cold by the time the new eggs came out. Not to mention we had to wait for more Benedict sauce to come out since that was taken when the eggs were.

Overall, extremely disappointed. Why can't they even cook the menu items correctly? The drinks are great- but not great enough to make sense to spend what you do. The best part of the brunch was the monkey bread and our server. Still not great enough for us to return, but I have given this place my all in terms of turning my opinion around.",2021-01-16 17:02:20,396,1808,

There website is the best and most user-friendly website for health care services that I've ever used. First, I appreciate that they are doing rapid COVID testing. Second, I am so happy that you can see the wait time online without ever leaving your house! Such an amazing perk! The wait time was much shorter for me than what was estimated. Online, the weight time was between 22 minutes and 45 minutes. I asked the receptionist since I thought a human would know better than their software... I probably waited about 15 minutes MAX! I had to double check that the nurse call me instead of someone else!

I also love that you can set up a future appointment--up to three days out. This place seems to be all about making sure people aren't wasting hours of their time just d as sitting in limbo!

Alright, all of those positive things were nice, but here comes the rain clouds.. The nurse that collected a sample for the test was way too rough!  She quickly jammed the q-tip up my nostrils and was too forceful! None of my other experiences were like this. Then another person followed up but wasn't a good or attentive listener. 

After getting my results back, I walked towards the exit and I heard someone discussing COVID results. I don't know if other patients were in earshot, but it didn't see appropriate.

I even showed her the notification from my bank account and from the app that said the money went through and they still refused to do anything. The guy behind came in for the same problem and we told her that we either want our food or a refund, SHE STILL REFUSED!!! As me and the guy behind were walking out he said to me ""This is such bs!! What a waste of money!"" And I completely agree with him, even if I lost $7. It's just the principle that matters. These people are disorganized, rude and unprofessional and possibly even thieves.

I ordered the sirloin with shrimp, green beans, and a sweet potato to share with my son. My husband ordered pulled pork with green beans and loaded mashed potatoes. I do like the ToGo ordering system. You text when you have arrived and your spot and then they text back on the status of your food. The app did not allow for a place to tip the server nor was I brought a receipt to sign and the server said she could just let it in for me. As it's 2020 I tipped in cash as I just wasn't sure on the safety of keying it in. I asked about bread and peanuts and the bread was in the bag but not peanuts. So the server went and got a bag for us. Once home we unloaded our meal. It was packaged well. The steak ,shrimp, sweet potato and loaded mash were good but the rest was lacking to say the least. The ""pulled pork"" was chunks of pork that had to be pulled apart yourself and it was dry. The barbecue sauce lacked flavor. The green beans (both of them) we could not even eat. There was an I overwhelming ""smoke"" flavor. But it tasted artificial and left a terrible taste in our mouth. The rolls were very dark and hard on the outside and then chewy on the inside. If I had to guess, the oven was up too high. My steak was cooked well but that is only because I ordered it medium rare when I really wanted medium. I guessed correctly that it would heat up/cook once in the container. Had I ordered medium it would have been well done and not good. There were no utensils or napkins despite my request for some. We will not be ordering from here again ToGo and may dine in once Covid conditions allow for this. We will never recommend the pulled pork as it wasn't pulled at all.

Staff wore masks and tables were cleaned promptly, but some customers seemed to be seated quite close to one another even though there was plenty of room to spread out. Service was prompt but I would not say fast.

The first time I visit a Thai restaurant I usually order chicken pad thai (hot) as I did at Thai Kitchen. The portion size was very large and the noodles were steaming hot arriving at the table. The noodles were covered in crushed peanut but I didn't notice any fresh bean sprouts. Digging into the dish I did find plenty of pieces of chicken and some green onions and bean sprouts, but the bean sprouts were either stir fried or from a can. Looking at the size and texture I am guessing canned. The pieces of chicken were oddly just warm while the rice noodles were piping hot. The sauce was annoyingly sweet and thick. I know Thai restaurants in Midwest America do not like using a lot of fish sauce because of American taste, but this sauce was one-note sweet. Spice level hot was not surprisingly mild. The unusual thing was that my son ordered the Spicy Bamboo stir-fry hot and his food came out seasoned with a good spicy kick. My son liked the Spicy Bamboo stir-fry with the julienned bamboo shoots but some of the other ingredients didn't match the list of ingredients on the menu. 

The visit for lunch left me quite confused especially after reading many reviews. Based on my chicken pad thai and the number of other Thai restaurants on the north side of Indianapolis, I don't see myself going back.",2021-01-22 18:41:18,306,1561,

I'm not sure how Toyosu went unnoticed to us for almost a year, probably due to the relatively quaint and humble store-front, but boy are we glad we discovered it. 

I'll start off by saying I wasn't sure how things were currently being run due to the COVID situation and didn't want to place two custom poke orders on the phone so I figured I would drive there and worst case scenario I call from outside the restaurant. I read the signs on the door carefully and proceeded to walk in.

The inside is clean and relatively small, when its fully open it probably has a capacity of about 10-15 people. A small sushi bar attached to the front counter held lots of very fresh fish and ingredients. I was immediately greeted through a plexiglass screen set up by the counter. The cashier handed me a little piece of paper for me to write down, check-box style, my two poke orders, and also pointed me to a table where I can lean on and sanitize my hands. 

After handing my order back to them, I hung out for only about 10 minutes before they had my order ready. Prices are typical poke prices at about $12-$15 each bowl. The ingredients were plentiful and very very fresh. They offer most of the traditional poke ingredients and exclude some of the more westernized ones (ex: no lettuce in place of rice, no fake crab, etc). 

All in all, this is my new go-to poke place due to proximity to my house, freshness of ingredients (always a big category when reviewing sushi/raw fish), and overall cleanliness. I can't wait to try some of the other options on their menu (mainly sushi and basic Japanese appetizers) when things open back up for indoor seating!",2021-01-11 13:16:39,359,1748,

The first time we had awesome, fast, and friendly service and it was in July/August 2020. Second time was Jan 2021 a really big let down! I ordered the HH special 2-1 vodka and when I ordered I requested two with my order. My friend ordered a double whiskey from HH special too. When our drinks came out my friend got her double order but  I only got one. I mentioned my order to the waitress and she said,""I only ordered you one at a time so it does get watered down so fast while you drink your first."" I told her,""I'll take that second one. I ordered two because I wanted a double right away."" She walked away to get my drink and within a minute I finished my cocktail. It's winter so my drink is not going to water down immediately. We got there about 5 and the place wasn't that busy and it took a long time to get these drinks. I had gone there planning to have more than 2 drinks and a $5 app but that waitress just irritated me so I didn't order anything more. Both times I was there with a party of 6 and we had super easy straightforward orders each time
This waitress in my Jan 2021 experience also only refilled our water one time the entire time my group was there for 2 hours. I drank my water down when I got it. Poor attention from the waitress and just a bad attitude. I'm a customer and allowed to order two drinks at once- I did it in the summer with no issues. It seemed like this waitress didn't want us to get happy hour specials when we arrived at 5 and it ended at 6, she came once to get orders during this time. Just disappointment. I was nice and polite and she rubbed me the wrong way, sorry I didn't spend more like I wanted to because of this service turned me off.  The food was delicious.",2021-01-16 14:53:46,390,1769,

The only negative thing I can say was that the food service was a bit slow. We were waiting for a solid 30-40 minutes for our entrees after we finished the appetizers. Not sure why it took a bit longer but they certainly did not rush us at all. We had an reservation at 6 and we didn't leave the restaurant until close to 9. 

We ordered the whole flounder, halibut, mussels and brussel sprouts. Each dish was unique and creative but the highlight was honestly the bread!! Warm, fluffy and slathered in butter, absolutely so delicious that we asked for seconds! The mussels were the group's second favorite, not your classic french mussels but still delicious. The halibut and flounder were also good but pale in comparison to the flavor complexity of the mussels. We ordered the apple pudding cake for dessert which was phenomenal! Our server even put a candle on it and was sweet enough to take it off our bill as a birthday gift. 

Our total bill came to be about 50 per person with drinks and we were stuffed! It's a little out of our budget to make it a regular stop but it's quite a treat for special occasions. I think it's worth every penny and compared to other restaurants in the neighborhood definitely 100% delivering on the quality/price. 

Besides the food, the decor and ambience was fantastic. This is a perfect spot for a nice dinner with friends or a date spot! Very instagram worthy decor!

First off, it is super easy to make an appointment, you can call OR you can easily book with them online and choose your preferred nail technician. 

Everyone who works here is sooooo nice! And it's the little things they consistently do that always make a difference. They always make sure you love the shape of your nail, they take the time to push back your cuticles, and they paint one of your nails and ask you if you like the color before proceeding with the rest. I feel at some nails salons they just rush through the process, but here they are efficient but take the time to make you happy! They have an awesome and ever growing gel and dip color selection too!

I felt inclined to write this review because when I went most recently one of my gel nails chipped. I had gotten them painted only a couple of days prior so I called and they said I could come in whenever I am available to get it fixed. I went in, and they very quickly took care of my nail and reassured me that they will fix any gel nails if they chip within 5 days of getting them done. That is good service right there! But on that note, I have to mention, they're so good in all my visits here this is the first time my nail has ever chipped so soon!

Also wow this salon is so clean and they take COVID precautions very seriously. There is plastic between you and the nail tech and between the chairs where other customers sit. They have an ipad to check in, and hand sanitizer is placed everywhere. Behind COVID, I always see them throughly cleaning between clients.",2021-01-05 00:56:06,348,1666,

     When I came My rep was festive in Halloween gear and had awesome customer service. Sadly, things went on and got postponed and postponed and postponed. I am not saying that he is at fault or the extended warranty company. But, between the two of them, my truck is at your dealership for almost 90 days. They say he didn't return calls in a timely manner. He says that he sent paperwork etc. 
     The back and forth went on for so long that I even considered trading the truck in for a new one. I received an appraisal of 500 dollars which was totally unacceptable. The salesman came back and basically said that the appraiser said that your truck is a piece of crap. So I went back to waiting for Mr. Powell and the extended warranty to come up with a resolution. 
      The truck got reviewed twice by the dealership technicians. The first estimate, I was told 800 dollars and the repairs were not covered by the warranty. I said ok, it's my vehicle, I need reliable transportation to teach school children and coach track, I'll get it back overtime. A few days later, I was told that the repairs were more extensive and that the dealership submitted a more expensive repair claim and I have been waiting ever since. 
     During this time I have continued to pay car insurance as well as extended warranty coverage. I am losing money because of my truck sitting there. I have been borrowing cars and using rideshare companies for weeks. The latest that I heard is that the inspector came there and the vehicle wasn't torn down to the point of failure and that the mechanic refused to tear it down. I have reached out to my service rep via phone and email and have not received a response. 
     I just want my vehicle back. Due to the length of this process, I do not feel that I should be charged anything to do so. When you have the opportunity, please respond. It's very frustrating knowing that you have a paid off vehicle just sitting on a lot not able to drive. I look forward to your response.",2021-01-22 20:59:58,436,2163,

We have been there since they opened up years back.  At some point, they opened a second restaurant on Washington to which we have never gone because it is too far away from where we live.  

The food was great even several months after the second location opened.  But eventually, our visits were met with less than the delicious food we were used to.  The quality of ingredients seemed to fall lower and lower every time we visited and so we started going less and less often.  

It has been several months now since we visited but we went there a couple of weeks back for the first time since COVID happened.  I ordered what I usually order - veggie skillet over taters add guac and sundried maters.  It is just something I always ordered.   

I started eating and I soon realized that it needed salt.  So I added salt and then I asked for Franks.  I added Franks and I realized that it just did not taste good.  The sundried maters had NO taste, only the texture.  The avocado was good but the taters were bland, the veggies tasted sort of.. spoiled?  Super ripe?  I dunno.  I didn't finish it and felt sad to tears.  Even the grapes in my fruit cup were soft and made me think they sat for a while.

I am not one to say anything at the time I am there.  I do not want pity nor do I want my food to come back ""spiced"" in some unsanitary way after requesting new food. I just say nothing and live with the experience I got there.


I don't know what is going on.  Restaurants that I once loved are going to hell.  Food quality is down the drain.  But, it isn't everywhere.  There are restaurants that have kept their quality and flavor up consistently during this pandemic.  I am noticing that about half of the places where we used to eat are suffering from poor quality food, a different, worse taste than normal and I just don't understand it.  How come some restaurants are keeping their quality up while others let it slip so low?  I would think that pandemic or not what you feed people should not be where your skimp to save money.  

I don't know because I never owned a restaurant.  But I have eaten at enough to know that it is the owners that make decisions about food quality and restaurant satisfaction.  Owners are why the windows might need cleaning or sills need dusting or floors need sweeping or bathrooms need cleaning.  Pandemic or not some things are not impacted by it.  I am looking forward to the days when the pandemic is over and good quality and good tasting foods are a norm again.  In the meanwhile maybe i will pause my reviews of restaurants.

I was very excited to find out that there's a spot I could go to in Nashville, and the timing was perfect since my family and I were visiting our extended family. 

The experience: 
Got there early (which I recommend since they can sell out), parking was on the side of the building, got inside and was greeted immediately, looked at the simple but informative menu and ordered food, sat at the tables outside, and dug in. 

The food: 
Ordered 1 1/2 lbs of brisket (1 lb fatty, 1/2 lb lean), 1/2 rack of spare ribs, 1 sausage link, mac n cheese, baked beans, green beans, and pulled pork chili verde with cornbread. 

The brisket was delicious - incredibly flavorful and filling. The salt and pepper bark with the smoke is a heavenly combination (shoutout to the pit master and the pit). The ribs were just as great - not fall off the bone (which means it's overcooked anyway), but it had a good bite to it, I would definitely order it again. Sausage was good enough - solid beef flavor but nothing special. 

The mac and cheese was great, but nothing spectacular. The baked beans were a pleasant surprise - it had a good kick to it and the salty/savory balanced each other well. The green beans were very salty - it would've tasted much better with a little less of that. The pulled pork chili verde was hearty and perfect for the cold weather - like a beautiful warm hug for my belly. 

Overall, this place is great. Amazing food, old school friendly service. East Nashville has something special on their hands.",2021-01-25 22:45:20,349,1634,

As a loyal Infiniti owner, this is my first Mercedes . First off, I purchased a BRAND NEW AMG CLA 45 this past summer. In addition to what came with the car, I added many additional lights and other options. About 2 months after purchase, I had a question re: body work and was referred to my advisor, Jaleel (sp?). I called him 4 days in a row, all the time the girls that answered assured me he was IN THE OFFICE, just busy. I left multiple messages and sent an email. When he finally returned my call, he told me he was NOT in the office. Hmmmm  Not what I'd expect from Mercedes. 
Moving on. Jan 21st Jerry came to p/u my car for addt issues with warning messages and window problems. He was SO NICE AND THOROUGH. Finally, A nice person representing a luxury car brand! From that point I got 1 text from Jaleel asking me about the window. NOTHING ELSE. Crickets. Jan 22nd at 9:15 I got a call from my husband telling me someone was at our house to pick up the loaner. My husband works from home and was pulled away from a ZOOM mtg he was hosting to answer the door that kept ringing. No notice, WHATSOEVER. I was out and about with the loaner. I rushed home to find Luigi there. He apologized for not confirming contact with me prior to, which is their policy. He had NO updates on my car and if it was even fixed. I was baffled. He left. When I got into my NEW car, I found coffee spilled all over the console controls and around the cup holder, and what appeared to be crumbs. See photos. Mind you, we have a STRICT rule in our car about no food and drinks. Bottled Water is allowed, occasionally. Luigi also gave his coffee cup to my husband to throw away. My husband was shocked, but too busy with his meeting to react.
This is just not what I'd expect from Mercedes.  Fortunately, I talked to an advisor named Bo who filled me in on what was done to my new car. He was patient and explained everything to me. Nice guy! 
After stewing and talking to friends, they encouraged me to call the service manager, John, to tell him about my Experience. John was nice and apologized, even offered to have my car detailed. I took him up in that, but he said he had to first speak with Luigi. Well, it's been a week and John has yet to call me back. I left him a voicemail Tuesday and he still hasn't gotten back to me. 
So.. I've learned a hard lesson here. I DO NOT recommend taking your vehicle for service at this dealer. At this point, I don't even recommend the dealer. Maybe not even Mercedes.",2021-01-29 15:54:17,593,2649,

First things first we did not make a reservation, however we reserved our spot in line online. Upon arrival we checked in, then waited only about 10mins to be seated. This is really cool and I appreciate any business that can make wait times easier for their guest! Who doesn't like express!!

During our wait outside we sat at one of the tables and they had heaters on the roof which felt really nice because it was freezing!! 

For starters we had the French toast bites. I really loved these and they were not over fried or over too crispy (which was my fear) to my surprise perfectly crisp with a nice chewy inside, lightly dusted with powdered sugar and a cinnamon glaze!! Perfection!! We also had the candied bacon, I had never tried this before so I was very excited to try. It was delightful, not too sweet but just the right amount of salty. It was crispy but it wasn't soft. 

I also had the morning margarita. It was not sweet, a little too salty and bitter. I wish they would have add sugar  instead of salt to the rim, I still finished it anyway. It wasn't horrible but not the best. For my meal I had the coasta rican. Rice and beans with a warm salsa with fried plantains and eggs. The warm salsa tasted like tomato paste or something that would belong on a pasta. The fried plantain was a chip that garnished the plate. So I was very disappointed with my dish as I thought I was getting an island ish breakfast.

My wife had the omelette which she enjoyed but her her cheese grits was grits was basically grits with shredded cheese on top, which isn't what we anticipated.. the burger was dry and the kids chicken slider had no flavor. 

 The service was amazing and other than the food my experience was great. I do recommend this location but not the burger, kids chicken slider and my dish! They get three dollar signs from me ($$$). They get you with the state, county and drink by the glass tax!?!?",2021-01-04 02:48:30,425,1990,

I understand the place was busy, but I could have sworn I heard him mumble  something to me about, "" having other mouths to feed""! WTH? At that point, I told him I was going to go ahead and just sit at a table since  he was too busy at the register to offer me one. I should have left because his attitude just was awful!  Needless to say, I waited for my order which I really didn't like since the buttermilk pancakes tasted like raw cake batter and their home fries were just like some fried potato chips.

  On Tuesday December 8, 2020,  I went to someone else to have them do a fill in for my mink lashes instead of going to Mylee at Tips and Toes.  Mylee is the owner of Tips and Toes and she was doing my lashes for about 6- 8 months every 3 weeks prior to December 8th. Before Mylee, I was going to a lady that worked for her at her spa called Allure Day Spa At 2605 Keystone Ave. for about 4 months who was good. Mylee was out of state in Kentucky this day however, and I had an event coming up and couldn't wait. 
        I scheduled an appointment with a reputable lady who had great reviews, a license, and clientele that were in my circle of friends. She agreed to see me, and do my mink lashes. It wasn't until I arrived that day and she looked at my lashes and said ""Oh God"". When she said that I was a bit uneasy, but she explained it in detail. What she advised me is that someone had literally CUT my lashes at the base, and I probably couldn't tell because when minks are applied the lash techs tape the eyelids in such a way that you cannot see until the procedure is completed. I honestly didn't believe her until I had to sit with the eyelash remover serum on my lashes  longer than the normal person would have to according to her because most were glued to my actual eyelid skin. Then after about 35 minutes or so it was all revealed. 
        She showed me how my eyelids were red and irritated, my OWN lashes were straight cut across at the root, and now there were no lashes to adhere the new mink lashes to. I was still flabbergasted, but at the same time instantly depressed.   I looked as if I were sick, and the more and more I looked in the mirror I felt betrayed, and hurt. She advised me since there weren't any lashes to adhere minks to that she could allow me to purchase some lashes that are magnetic until my lashes start to grow back after applying serums and oils to my eyelids. Since I work as a model for promotions for various companies including my own, I knew immediately that I couldn't be the face of any promotions for a while and would be losing money until my natural lashes grew back at least half way or full. I understand that when you wear false or mink lashes they may take out a few lashes here and there, but mine were actually cut and there was nothing that I could do about it. 
             After my visit with the new lash tech, I went home sobbing uncontrollably. My boyfriend wanted to see me and I wouldn't even open the bathroom door for an hour. When I did come out my 7 year old son was even laughing at me asking what happened to my face, and then proceeded to tell me that I looked funny. This just made me want to stay in my room and not come out. I only wore the magnetic lashes for about a week due to the lashes not fitting the curvature of my eyelid good, and the eyeliner was burning since the lashes Mylee put on stripped some of my eyelid skin off in certain parts. 
          The same day this was exposed to me I immediately contacted Mylee to see if this was true and why? She explained to me that she did indeed cut my lashes at the base of the eyelash and would place the false lashes in their place. She also stated that she does this for all her clients! She advised me via text messages which I have, that she never uses the recommended remover that is intended for mink lash removal because it has chemicals in it. She says that ""it is healthier to cut the lashes out then apply another lash where it was"".  She also stated that "" She cut the growth out of it, then reattaches the new one with where it had grown"".  Mylee reached out to me a couple times that same week saying that she is sorry, and to come in and she will make me pretty again and put on more lashes, but I told her no I have no lashes and I don't want them applied to my skin any longer.  At this point I no longer trusted her either.  I'm writing this to advise people who do get mink lashes or any lashes where your eyes are taped shut, to please be aware of the the services that are being performed while you are blindly trusting those around you.",2021-01-10 05:27:21,873,4118,

usually pretty generous when it comes to giving out ratings, so keeping that in mind, we stopped at Mikes today for lunch , the place is clean the staff was outstanding , the place is huge , house in a redone building from the 1800's really nice place 

But that was about the extent of it , the only issue with Mikes was the food 

Now Ive had great, Ive had good and Ive had bad, id be lyng if i said the food was bad, but it was really only average at best IMO and the reason why is really kinda bothersome . 

The issue ......... It was so damn bland, I mean EVERYTHING but the fries tasted like they ran out of seasonings in the kitchen ...

We ordered the Plum sesame wings, a side salad, a veggie burger and some extra coleslaw 

Now the food was hot and fresh, they don't skimp on portion size 

But that is where I gotta back off a little, the wings are large, which from time to time can = Gamy tasting, and sadly these did .  

They also had no seasoning other than the sauce on them which itself had a very delicate, almost non existent flavor . 

But I have to say I was really disappointed because they looked great , and we were starving, 

My partners Veg burger was equally as disappointing, now ill say I don't get who the hell eats those no meat burgers anyway, it kinda freaks me out ..but this was LITERALLY a patty and bun ....... that's it and it was flavorless, no seasoning at all, no toppings, no cheese no nothing.  

The gave us a bottle of ketchup, but... Come on

The fries that came with the burger however were the polar opposite, almost over seasoned, extremely heavy handed on the salt , they were good, but we started using the fries to season other things on the table 

The Coleslaw ...again it tasted like mayo and cabbage, with a little bit of celery seed i think?  It too was really bland 

In the end we paid about $40 bucks for everything including 2 sodas , I cant give this more than 2 stars, because to me All you need to do is season the damn food it would be so much better , but it was a real let down

The bread with the cheddar butter was absolutely delicious, and so warm! It melted the butter perfectly. Between the four of us, we got the Caesar salad,  crab cake, lobster bisque, and egg roll as starters -- everyone was really happy. The crab cake was delicious!
Then we came together and the four of us all ordered the filet mignon...and none of us were disappointed. Each steak was cooked perfectly and had a wonderful flavor. It was served with carrots, potatoes, and broccolini, all wonderful. A few of us also added a scallop (it was difficult to decide between the entree of filet or scallops!) and it was great to have a little variety to the meal. Great flavor as well!
For dessert, we tried the brownie and the creme brûlée. So good! The meal was excellent from start to finish -- especially since they brought out chocolate truffles to finish out the meal.
Our server, Kevin, took such great care of us. He made sure our waters were full, cleared the table throughout the meal, and made sure that our courses came out with the perfect amount of time between them (since we ordered everything at one time in the beginning). All the employees seemed to work as a team, checking in on us, greeting us as we walked through the restaurant, and making themselves available if anything were needed. We were very happy with the service!",2021-01-28 02:03:16,328,1584,

This is a stumbling block for me to purchase any of your products I would like to buy for self defense for my mother and myself, and as possibly a new hobby. 
The first time I went there I was talking with an older gentleman and when I told him of my lack of knowledge regarding firearms he suggested I go to a gun range. That was it. Already feeling nervous and intimidated because of my ignorance, I was turned away.
The second time I went, 1/7/2021, I expressed concern over what was needed for a background check, and was just told, ""we don't do background checks."" He offered no help whatsoever. No inquiries of how to help me, or where to go, except a ""go to the police"". 
Is this common?
Does everyone have to go to the police department to register for a firearms background check? 
When I mentioned this to a co-worker of mine he was surprised because they did a background check at the store where he bought a pistol. 
Very dissatisfied and disappointed to say the least. All I have is money I want to spend on a purchase at a store, and I get nothing. And the thing is, is I work in retail and try to help anyone I can get what the need and want without question. So I'm not understanding why I received such shabby treatment. 
Anyways I gave them two chances and am too intimidated to try again. I'll have to go somewhere else.",2021-01-08 08:49:55,326,1522,

We ordered IHOP for delivery this afternoon for a late lunch (of breakfast food). I placed the order on Uber Eats at around 2:15. I saw the estimated delivery time was 3:15, so I went to get a quick oil change, because there's another one of us home who could get the order if I wasn't back in time.)
We ordered a Belgian Waffle with bacon, Biscuits and Gravy with sausage and hash browns, and an orange juice. 
While my oil was being changed (at about 3:10), I got a text from the person at home saying the food was here, but I wasn't going to be happy. There were no hash browns and no gravy (for my biscuit and GRAVY). SMH So, I kept my cool and said I would just go to the IHOP and get them. After all, it was only a 20 minute drive (+20 minutes back). That's when my appalling visit began. 
I got to the restaurant at about 3:30. There was no one at the host(ess) stand, so I decided to wait in the pay line and let the cashier know. Oh boy. 
Just before I got to the line, a group of about 8 high school or college kids got in line before me, each with a separate check. Of course. Well, they apparently expected what they ordered to be some happy hour price of $5, which they all ordered, and which they were all charged full price. The rude cashier hostess told them something about they ordered wrong; they said they ordered it just how it was on the happy hour menu. She proceeds to write them all (8) new checks, and then goes to the kitchen, maybe to talk to the manager? Minutes later she came back out, and rang them each up. Next - my turn, finally! By this time it was around 3:45.  Well, not so much. She disappeared, went to help a few tables, rang some other check up, and then back to the kitchen. 
At this point, I saw a family of 10 come in and seat themselves after not being helped for a few minutes. I decided to have a seat, because who knows how long it will be before she comes back? As I see her cone out of the kitchen, a man and his daughter get to the line before me, so I got to wait again!  Remember I STILL have not been able to tell someone that my order was just missing something and I wanted to pick it up. 
Finally, around 4:00, the rude cashier lady asks me if I'm ready to pay out. Lol. I told her what had happened, and quite disrespectfully and impolite, she screeched ""You have to see a manager about that."" I said ""OK,"" expecting that she would go get the manager for me or something. After about another 5 minutes, I asked her if I was supposed to go find the manager. No response. Soooooo......I went back by the kitchen to ""catch"" the manager as she came out. She went out the other side, helped a few tables, and then took a complaint from a man and his two kids about their meals all being wrong. Then she went back to fix his order. 
Remember that family of 10 that seated themselves? It was about this time that they got up and left, as they still hasn't seen a server.  I also texted my friend at home to ask him to call the restaurant to let them know that I was there and had been waiting over 30 minutes just to get my order fixed. 
Soon, the manage came over to see what I needed. I explained the situation, and she quickly got my missing items. But I think she thought I was the Uber driver or something. She had no apology, no offer to comp anything or make me satisfied. So I got home to the rest of my meal HOURS after it was ordered (at 4:40). 
I didn't even attempt the hours-old over medium eggs.   :( 
It's too bad, because we actually eat out a lot. We just wanted delivery today so we could watch the NFL playoffs. We eat out a lot and always tip at least 50%...but this wretched restaurant and its rude employees will NEVER see another cent from me. Stay away at all costs...just look at how many people's meals were ruined today on my visit...on one day. 
I know this was long...sorry. I just wanted to give details so no one would think I was just a disgruntled ex-employee or something. This really was an awful experience. Sheesh. Try to help out struggling restaurants during Covid and experience this.",2021-01-10 23:25:28,969,4289,

After several visits and tests with our primary vet, they found a cancerous tumor in my baby. Our two options for treatments were VSEC or PennVet. Of course my first instinct was to go with Penn because they're just so well-known but our primary vet let me know that they had special procedures to schedule an appointment due to Covid. I didn't want to go through any complicated steps and stress myself out any more than I already was so I checked out VSEC. VSEC also had better reviews than Penn so I felt relieved. 

Setting up an appointment was super easy and they were SO friendly that first visit. Much like other places, you call them to pick up your fur baby and then everything is done over the phone. After about an hour of waiting in the car, they gave me a call to discuss our next steps, got checked out and then they brought my pup back out to me. From the surgeons on the phone, staff checking me out, and the techs who escorted my pup in and out of the facility, were all exceptionally kind. 

The next few times that actually mattered, when he got the surgery, etc., they weren't so much - everyone was very brusque and seemed to be bothered by us which doesn't help in such a stressful situation. The tech who brought my baby back out after surgery was kind enough to help me carry him into the car though because that was a challenge to do alone. 

They are definitely pricey but I guess that's to be expected with an emergency facility - can't imagine PennVet is any cheaper. At the end of it all, I'm glad that they saved my dog and seemed to know what they were doing. It's what really matters than poor bedside manners. It's also the reason for scoring them up rather than down. I'm glad to have them around as a resource but hope I don't have to go back there again anytime soon!",2021-01-13 02:37:28,416,1968,

RESPONSE TO OWNER:

Let's be a little more transparent about this.  I brought my cat into your office on January 5th with a urinary obstruction.  After ""hoping for the best,"" you suggested a follow-up appointment on the 13th of January.  Well, jaxders was in and out of your clinic for days following the original appointment.  He was brought back the next day and you kept him over night for 24 hours. After he still seemed to not be doing well, and entrusting you with his care- I brought him back.  You had him there from Friday (1/8) to Monday (1/11).  When I picked him up, you never had the decency to go over what treatment was given to him over the weekend or any prognosis.  You handed him to me in his carrier and said you were closing soon and have other patients to attend to. The only calls I received after that point, which I'm assuming you were well aware my cat was dying- was from your receptionist.  I specifically asked to speak to you for days after getting him home. He was not okay when he got out of his crate after the 72 hours of being at your facility.  He was staggering, couldn't walk right and you blamed it on his pain medication - a dose which was far less that he had originally which just made him slightly groggy.  You said this was normal. I remained hopeful, kept calling your office and kept getting excuses for not hearing from you. Once again, I trusted you as a Doctor.  Thursday night (1/14) my cat couldn't move his back legs.  At 0800 the next morning I called your clinic and expressed how ridiculous it was I hadn't heard from you, personally.  I guess you can do surgery on an animal while answering questions I'm asking your receptionist but don't have an extra 5 minutes out of your busy schedule to do a follow up.  You knew you ruptured his bladder while he was in your treatment.  He wasn't peeing in your care, he was LEAKING BECAUSE YOU RUPTURED HIS BLADDER AND NEVER SAID A GOD DAMN THING.  You tried covering it up, and you knew what the outcome was going to be.  The other vet concurred with my own research as a layperson that his bladder had been ruptured.  What did you say after 25 years of practice? It could possibly be a blood clot.  So you could get more money out of me.  Thank you to the caring, amazing vet who was so supportive and let me hold my baby in my arms as she put him down.  I am so glad you weren't the one who got the pleasure of doing so.",2021-01-16 21:08:32,549,2579,

Our room did not have working A/C or heater, despite two visits from engineering. We were completely frozen the first few days and the last three nights were either too hot or too cold but the thermostat was not accurate and the heater made knocking noises all night.

We enjoyed their food and the atmosphere was just right for us on a random Sunday afternoon. The waiters/waitresses were very nice and always remembered our orders, considering we were there weekly. You could say Scotto Pizza was our favorite spot to go to.

This all tragically changed. I've loved Scotto's since I was young and I was now old enough to get a job. When looking for a job I figured Scotto's would be perfect, I was already familiar with them and loved the food. I went in and asked if they were hiring and they were. This is when it started to get a little weird. 

They hired me but did not make me fill out an application or anything like that. They also informed me that they pay under the table to avoid the taxes (which is of course illegal). When I started working they would just randomly tell me after my shift the next time I would work and not have me on a schedule. Another boy my age came in around the same time and asked for a job as well. They began to confuse us and not realize which one of us they told to work when. 

Eventually after about 2 weeks of working for them and hearing that they were talking about the both of us behind our backs I was getting annoyed working there. Nonetheless though I still continued to work and try my best. Then all of a sudden after one day of work they never told me the next day I would be working. I called the owner about 3 separate times wondering when I would be coming in next. Every time he said to me he didn't know. I ended up talking to the other kid about it and he was having the same situation. I was very confused and considering it was my first job I was upset and thought I did something wrong. About 3 months passed and they never called me or the other kid again, not even to tell me that they moved on. Not to mention, I worked 2 and a half weeks and they never paid me for that work. 

Eventually, we had to go into Scotto's and demand that they give us our money we worked for and they did. Although, the manager working there tried to say that they told us to come in and get the money when they 100% did not. Scotto Pizza completely took advantage of me and I was extremely disappointed considering my history with the pizzeria. 

I can say that my family and I have not been back to this establishment ever since. I put this review so if anyone is considering working there you know what you're getting into.

It's like taking your child to open heart surgery, I know! But since my first time visiting this shop some years ago, I have never had anxiety about a repair again.

I bought my cello at this store. They have an amazing selection of instruments that you can choose from, varying in price a lot. You can get a lower-price student instrument, all the way to a very expensive professional instrument that will last you a lifetime. They don't sell even one instrument that isn't good quality, so you'll never be screwed with a bad instrument. I bought my cello there about a year and a half ago, and will never go anywhere else. I honestly fear a day where I might move away from Carmel, IN because I don't want to leave this shop. About a month after buying my cello, my tailpiece broke, and I brought it in to be looked at. They replaced my tailpiece with their preferred tailpiece, and didn't even charge me anything since I just bought it.

Yesterday morning I was sitting in a wider chair than usual, picked up my instrument, and hit the corner on the side of the chair, breaking it off. Assuming you play an instrument, you know exactly why I cried for a full 30 minutes. After collecting myself, and finishing my classes for the day, I went on their website and scheduled an appointment about 2 hours in advance. They got me in the shop, evaluated the damage, very calmly said ""oh, it's just the corner."" And I breathed a huge sigh of relief as I knew it was going to be fine. My cello was finished the next morning, and it only cost me $25. The luthier Alex did an incredible job repairing the corner, you honestly can't even tell it was broken unless you're really really close and specifically looking for it.

I have heard a few people say that the workers come off as rude, or judgmental, however I find that is just because of the accent. It's run by two Russians, and they are some of the nicest people ever. They are not afraid to tell you that something is wrong, or won't work for you. I asked one day about a set of strings I thought sounded really nice on another cello, and I would've paid quite a lot of money for them, as they're very expensive strings, and Vladimir (the man behind the desk who also does minor fixes) told me that the set I wanted wouldn't sound good on my cello, and that I shouldn't waste my money on them. I appreciated that so much! Because I know people that wouldn't care about my experience and just sell me them any way they could because they're expensive. So they may sound a little scary at first, or tell you exactly like it is, but that's because they want nothing but the best for you. They are always willing to help you out.

Booking an appointment online is a breeze. Their website is efficient and easy to use. You will get an email and a text confirming your appointment, and they'll even send you an email invoice where you can pay the fee straight from your phone.

If you have never been to this shop, please go! You will not regret it. They're, as of the time of writing this, only open by appointment (because of COVID-19), but after this is all over, just walk inside because it's amazing just to be in there. A whole wall filled with beautiful violins, and next to them a full rack of gorgeous cellos. I know how hard it is when you break your instrument and have to send it in to be repaired, because it's your baby. I've had 2 seams re-glued, and a corner fixed, along with many minor repairs, and they always do an incredible job, and don't even charge very much. These are the only people I trust to fix my cello.

P.S. They also carry the Cello Suites, which I have yet to find anywhere else in Carmel. So if you're looking for Bach's 6 suites... they have it.",2021-01-21 22:41:03,835,3829,

Life is all about second chances. And I'm grateful to be given this second chance to stay at the Upham Hotel. Our entire stay has been incredibly marvelous. I need to mention first & foremost the lovely person behind it all - Denise Spain, General Manager. Ms. Denise went above & beyond to rectify the unfortunate experience we previously had. She was there to greet us when we arrived and she even personally went with us to show us our room and we had a short but fun, light & positive conversation. Our experience this time started very delightful and pleasant and I didn't want it to end. The hotel grounds is such a unique space with its expansive garden areas with wooden beach chairs where you can quietly read a book or enjoy a glass of their wonderful complementary wine. There is even a smaller garden area beside the main garden where I envision to be a good space to meditate with the sound of water trickling from the small fountain. Or just enjoy the peace that the space brings. The gazebo is also a unique touch which gives a classy and elegant feel to the overall vibe of the outdoor area.  The room we stayed in was spacious and extremely comfortable. It was also well-lit.  The highlight of it all for me was our own private patio. We frequent hotels when traveling and very rare do I experience a hotel such as this where you can enjoy your coffee, your meals, a good read or just to lounge in your very own patio in the comfort of your hotel room.  The bathroom was newly renovated with a good space and great shower. There was that exquisite basket filled with delicious baked goods waiting when you arrived, along with the complementary bottle of wine (which I thought was a genuinely thoughtful touch). The bed was comfy with clean and fresh-smelling sheets. All the staff were wearing masks and were adhering to social distancing. This time around, I couldn't really mention any areas for improvement and I can only hope that this hotel continues to thrive in the leadership and guidance of their General Manager. Ms. Denise, please continue to move forward in leaps and bounds. Thank you very much for a memorable birthday weekend you allowed me to have.",2021-01-17 14:51:02,428,2198,

Location wise... it's a good location! If you're near Mt Laurel area and you see the ""New Brewery"" signs.... these signs lead you to this brewery!Wouldn't even have thought there was a brewery hidden next to the Virtua office and surrounded by a ton of hotels that are in walking distance. So if you're staying in one of these hotels, it is worth to drop by and check em out. Good amount of space inside and had tons of seating when I came on a Sunday afternoon.

Beers
Lots to choose from! 18 on tap to be exact. My review is not for any of the IPAs but they had a good number of options for those that are IPA fans. The names were fun... wish I didn't eat brunch right before coming here so I can try more... but the names were entertaining such TuHop Shakur.... Hoptimus Prime just to name a few. Flights of 4 or 6 are available at this brewery so you can sample before committing!

Great & Powerful Woz - their sour beer... you know the face kids make when tasting something sour for the first time? That's basically the face I made haha... super super sour made my jaw hurt lol. Definitely would not be able to drink more than just a taster size of this!

It's a Trap - Their Trappist beer was good but I thought was a little too syrupy and sweet. I can taste the brown sugar a bit too much with this one.

O'Banions Brew - Irish Red Ale.... light and drinkable... just wasn't wowed or anything. It was kinda just meh.

Harry Stouter - This stout was creamy and was my favorite. I am a stout girl... but I thought the flavors were good.. so it was the favorite out of the bunch. 

I'm not gonna go out of my way to come back to this brewery.. but if I'm in the area... may stop in and see if they've got other new beers on tap.

Service was decent, our server was fantastic, the hostess could have given two shits (do they ever? I dont think I've encountered a nice hostess ever), food runners were great, solid Barnabys style. It still FEELS like Barbanbys inside, they fixed up the inside, pulled up the old carpet, made it very rustic but at the same time didnt fix up the bathrooms, which were filthy and poorly kept. For brunch we split the breakfast pizza, my date got eggs Benedict and I got Huevos Rancheros. Breakfast pizza is amazing. Solid hipster style pizza, really good toppings, the maple potato chips on top made for a nice sweet savory taste. My date said the eggs Benedict were great, I had some of the hollandaise and it tasted homemade. It was a fantastic sized portion as well. All brunch entrees come with some of the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had, mixed with roasted peppers and onions. 
Ok so now onto the bad. I had to double check the menu after we ate to make sure I didnt order the wrong thing. So take the worst nachos you've ever had, remove the nachos and keep the filling. Thats what was inside my Huevos Rancheros. It tasted like taco meat chili (it was supposed to be chorizo, it wasnt) with overcooked black beans, melted Kraft singles and onions, inside tortillas that weren't cooked and covered (and made very soggy) with ""homemade sauce"" which just tasted like salsa. The eggs on top were good, the guacamole was also good. I dont know what the hell they stuffed inside these tortillas, but after two bites, I scraped the ""meat"" and beans and put some potatoes and peppers in and I was good to go. 
I rarely if ever complain about food, I'm pretty easy going on that front, but for once I was actually disgusted.",2021-01-10 23:28:59,394,1861,

I had hoped Barrio Charro's mercado was going to have a decent amount of bread choices, but I only saw ciabatta, baguette, and focaccia. So here is my mercado list first: chipotle butter, jalapeño focaccia, cinnamon conchita/pan dulce, tortilla chips, flan, baguette. The only thing I regret not buying is the prickly pear BBQ sauce.

I'm going to start with the flan. I've not have flan this dense before. It wasn't a heavy tasting custard, but it was thick - not airy/light like a panna cotta consistency. I liked the flavor a lot though, it wasn't overly sweet, but just the right amount of condensed milk, vanilla and sugar. The focaccia was really good lightly toasted with the chipotle butter - I ate mine topped with scrambled eggs and it was pretty tasty. The smokiness and pepper mixed with the jalapeño in the bread brought a lot to the eggs, my taste buds were happy. I was also super happy with the conchita. It stayed super soft despite sitting in a loosely sealed bag for a few days. I definitely recommend buying them to accompany your coffee.

Now on to the prepared foods: tlayuda viejo and a historico, centro caesar, and a torta asada Armando. All of it was super good.  The caesar was unlike what you'd get somewhere else. There was an extra element to their dressing, I almost thought the dressing tasted like caesar dressing with a touch of thousand island. Anyhow, the salad also had strawberries in it. It's not something I necessarily prefer in my caesar, but the charred onion was a great addition. When I first saw the tlayudas, I assumed they were going to be simple, but they were super flavorful with all the toppings. Lastly, the torta was surprisingly good too - yes, I made wrong assumptions about this sandwich as well. The bread was soft and the carne asada was tender, everything was tasty.

I'm an instant fan of Barrio Charro. I want to try everything on the menu and next time I'm there, I'm going to buy a jar of the BBQ sauce, and then some.",2021-01-26 01:25:56,439,2099,

It quickly became the worst place ever. Always getting a different hygienist, constant billing issues with them over billing me and my insurance company and keeping the extra money. At one point I had been over billed by several hundred dollars and instead of a prompt refund they dragged out repayment for over a year,  saying I could use my credit for all these extra fluoride and other unnecessary treatments.

The Office manager told me she would discuss my concerns with Dr. Odham but at this point I felt uncomfortable with Dr. Odham as this was the third time I had an issues with her work. I asked for a different doctor and was told that was not possible. When it was time to put on the new crown, Dr. Odham waited until she had tools in my mouth and could not respond and proceeded to say....""In case your not aware....my entire family works here. My brothers, sisters, THE MANAGER...all family here."" Well of course I knew that. I had been going there when she was still a kid and her father was my dentist. I assume she was telling me this to let me know she knew I had requested a different dentist. I had no problem with her knowing. I had a right to my opinion, a right to ask for a different Dentist and I had done nothing wrong. Her tone was not friendly and now I felt intimidated and threatened. But with no ability to respond, no warning, and no novocaine, she proceeded to rip off the old crown. Literally savagely ripped it out unlike anything I ever experienced.  She seemed angry and I definitely felt she had no regard for me or the obvious fear and pain she was  inflicting on me,  then she slapped on the new crown without even cleaning out debris of the broken tooth she had damaged ripping off the crown. I felt with my tongue the jagged tooth, but she did no build up, nothing thats normally done after a crown removal. Its no surprise,  shortly afterwards, I lost that tooth despite paying thousands of dollars to save it. I assume the loss was from severe trauma from the way the old crown was brutally removed or maybe from the sight not being cleaned properly or the tooth patched before placing on the second ill fitted crown. There are just no words to describe such a thing or person. There were so many other things which went in to decline after the expansion. It went from this friendly quaint office to a place where you felt like cattle being prodded thru a process, and the poor design of the new addition made it so you can hear everything going on in every room. I am all about businesses expanding and prospering but not at the cost of patient comfort or care and I feel this family lost sight of the mission and some in my opinion are immature, cruel, unprofessional, and incompetent.  My entire family, and my friends have left there. We found a new place that is truly a family dentistry not just in name,  that  still care about their patients. No, I wont ever recommend Klement Family Dental to anyone ever again. Were people, not cattle and even cattle matter!",2021-01-20 17:26:26,748,3685,

I had already heard from two other friends' that this may not be the best experience but wanted to remain optimistic. However, there were many many disappointments throughout our entire experience. 

1. Our reservations were early and most of our party was running late. However, we only had 7 and there is plenty of seating available throughout the restaurant. Not one additional table came in, nor was anyone waiting, when the hostess came up to my friend and I and said ""if your party is not here in 5-7 minutes we have to cancel your reservation."" This was rude and unnecessary, being that we already had told her they were almost there and no one was waiting for a table. 

2. Our food came out all wrong. One of my friends received his pizza (entree) while we were still ordering appetizers. 

3. The calamari and Brussels sprouts were great! 

4. I asked if we could substitute one of our sides for fries and my waitress said that because I'm not a child, she could not. So we settled for the broccoli, which was so tough it didn't even taste cooked. 

5. The almond crusted trout with brown butter was disappointing. There was absolutely no sauce. We asked for more and they brought us out Italian dressing. After realizing, they brought us back more sauce. It still did not taste right. 

6. After ordering another round of cocktails, I asked our server to bring out some straws and the next time she came back was to ask if we were ready for checks. 


Overall, just a snooty vibe. The drinks were great and maybe I'll be back only for pizza and drinks during happy hour, but I was not pleased at all.",2021-01-18 15:06:37,352,1705,

Today January 09, 2021 I ordered 2 Shrimp Fried Rice, Shrimp Lo Mein, Wong Tong Soup, Vegi and Shrimp Eggrolls. I Love Their Food, But Their Customer Service Was Like Woa. First I need help trying to change an order that I placed online. And the so called manager refused to fix it, so I had to keep the order and add the items that I wanted to add on a separate order, then I called rite back to add the red sweet and sour sauce, and ended up calling 5 times before she picked up, just so that She could tell me that my order was already on it's way.
Now this' where Her Attatude got Really Disrespectful. I called to let Her know that I found 3 pieces of plastic in my small fried rice. (I need to explain the reason that I keep saying Her... Because when I called each time...I kept asking Her name and she told me that it wasn't important and all I needed to know was that She was the manager, WOW). She then told me that I wasn't getting any thing free, then she told me that I didn't know how to order, mind you, while all of this is going on, she's yelling at Me, so that changed my whole attitude, which had me yelling, so she then hung up on me, 3 times.
 I called back at least 9 times, with no Answer. This is DEFINITELY My Last Time Eating At Green Tea.

On my first visit I got a $50 sew in. Straight hair center part.... simple.... hair left out on top. It was basic. Max time maybe in there 3 hours. Each track maybe had 6 stitches. That's was kinda ratchet. but It was what I asked for. Girl gave me curls to help blend my hair even though the $50 package doesn't call for it. Lasted 2 months

My second visit I had expensive bundles of wavy hair. Can't remember the girls name but but she was clearly the best one in there. My hair was laid nice. Side parted and sewin better than the first time. Way more stitches per track. Lasted almost 3 months. No problems.

My third visit was wash curl and trim on natural hair. Like an inch and half at most I told her. Okay I had a new girl that I never saw before. My hair is almost middle of my back and 3C.  SHE CUT MY HAIR BLOWDRIED . instead of after flat ironing!!!!She chopped off half my hair and gave me curls. It wasn't pretty. I was irritated. It wasn't cute. Didn't go back for over a year.

my third visit was a last minute walk in on a Sunday late afternoon. I was surprised with a vacation on a Saturday and told ""we leaving on Monday"" so they were my only option. I was last person in and manager talked Simone into seeing me up at last minutes due to my story. I was really appreciative. She was super sweet. We talked about men and vacays and i got a deluxe and I look bomb! 

Last visit I got a bob with lace closure it looked amazing. I got a million compliments. I went to the same girl from my second visit and requested her. No problems. 

I think there great if you get a good stylist.

They do talk trashy sometimes. Like about their abortions or money issues but I think that's salon talk in general.... so I was cool. 

I would go there again but seems like some ppl don't stay long and I don't think the girl who was doing my hair is still there.",2021-01-12 22:39:26,436,1912,
nkuJk2Ai6P6u40BbaQrmZQ,qpHcaQpmRVbngq1-7n_ViA,D_4iPUtYGB6F1C0kaneTPw,2,2,0,1,"I chose the hotel carefully because I was driving from Philadelphia to Texas to see my mom who was not doing well and I needed a place to stay half way through my journey. I chose to drive instead of fly because of safety during Covid, so I knew I wanted a place that would offer all of the safety and convenience during these tricky times. I selected a Marriott because they have a decent reputation. They checked my boxes...coffee maker, refrigerator in the room, a restaurant downstairs from which I could order food so that we wouldn't be dining anywhere (I was traveling with my 15-year-old daughter) and I was determined, that once I checked in for the night that I wouldn't have to leave my room until it was time to check out the next day. I was wrong. 

We chose self-park, which still cost $35, but the garage was not at all convenient and we ended up lugging our bags a good distance away to get to the hotel. We put our order in for food immediately because the restaurant was about to close. This was the best part about our stay...not the food necessarily...but the server at the bar that promptly took our order with a smile, made sure we had every sauce and packet available for our  Nashville hot chicken sandwiches and called our room when our food was ready and said, ""Your dinner is ready!"". He was delightful. The food was just ok. The Nashville hot chicken sandwich was a bit dry and the fries were cold. 

The real disappointment came when I needed feminine supplies for my daughter. I called hospitality and requested them but it took details to explain what I needed and after the request was finally understood I was placed on hold for quite a while. After a wait, I was told, ""We do have them, but we are out of them right now."" This felt completely unacceptable to me and I can only consider that this is a management issue. I know it's Covid, I know things are harder these days, but if you can stock up on lotions, toothbrushes and extra shower caps, feminine products should be at the top of the list. He suggested a Walgreen's (remember, I had been driving for 14 hours and had just parked my car in a garage that was more than an inconvenient distance away). I asked him if he was sure that the Walgreen's was open and after double checking he told me they were closed. I am not an ""insister"" but I actually insisted that he fix the problem. I chose the hotel so that I would have my basic needs met. He finally agreed to ""find someone"" to get what I needed. After about 30 minutes he came to my door with ""hotel grade"" feminine products, so it appears that the dilemma could have been solved without my insisted prompting.

I was happy to have a coffee maker in the room (it was one of my checked boxes) but when I attempted to make coffee in the morning, (at 5:30 am...I had a 10 hour drive ahead of me) a piece was missing from the machine and it was inoperable. Again, I called the front desk and the woman told me that there is no one to replace the coffee maker and I could come down to the front desk to retrieve my coffee. I adorned my face mask and shuffled down to the front desk where they were SELLING Starbucks on a make-shift table in the lobby. She ""gave"" me two cups instead of charging me for it. The WiFi is ten bucks. The parking is 35. The coffee maker was broken but they sell cups of coffee in the lobby and necessary amenities were nonexistent. I am so glad I didn't pre-book this hotel for the way back because when I initially made my reservation I almost did. I ended up staying at a Hampton Inn. My coffee maker worked, they served to-go breakfast in the lobby and I enjoyed free parking. 
 I know these are tricky times and places are understaffed and Covid has stolen our souls. But if you are an establishment, in the HOSPITALITY industry, who is still charging your regular rates and have remained open with no disclaimer that you will not be serviced in a typical manner, then I believe it is important to continue to at the very LEAST meet the basic requirements. I chose this hotel BECAUSE of Covid...to be safe in my room and have the things provided for me that I was paying for. Never. Again.",2021-01-12 14:41:42,877,4162,

Rumor is that the menu is changing from pre-fixed to a la carte on January 13th. I was lucky enough to get the full pre-fixed menu experience when I dined in on the 10th! I paid $45 and got to pick three mini ""appetizers"" aka salatim or ""salads"", one hummus, and one main course. I ordered the shakshuka as my main and holy moly was it good. My favorite components of the meal were the baba ganoush and the tomatillo bloody mary. The flavors of each were simply out of this world. You're going to leave this place very full, maybe drunk, and blown away. You'll also likely have some food to-go if you order a salatim, hummus, and main. If you don't order one of each for yourself, I would really recommend sharing!

Oh and did I mention the service was amazing. My lovely waitress (pink-haired sweetheart) was so fun! She was attentive and made sure everything about our dining experience was perfect. 

As far as COVID-19 precautions go, this restaurant is taking them all (which I really appreciate). They even encourage you to wear your masks while you order your food; most places don't do that and I don't know why. Call or make a reservation online because currently seating is limited due to the New Orleans restrictions. 

A final note - and a hot take. I have eaten at both Shaya and Saba and while they were both delicious, if you are choosing between the two I would recommend Saba. Shaya is still associated with John Besh while Saba is only associated with Alon Shaya (the mastermind behind all of this greatness). Apparently John Besh has a history of sexual harassment and I would like to choose not to support that. But, again, that's my hot take and it's up to you to read up all about it and make the decision for yourself. The takeaway here: Saba is the bomb!!",2021-01-13 22:22:59,390,1838,

Summary: a fun, reasonably priced and happening restaurant in the heart of south Tampa. Come on Taco Tuesday for extra savings and more food! The Ciccio family knows how to do it right! 

My friends and I came on a Tuesday night! It was a 20-30 min wait indoors but immediate seating outdoors. This was our second time coming for taco Tuesday. Service was great each time! 

For $2 a taco, you can taste each one to find out which one you'll be binging on the next time you come! At $4 a pint of sangria, it's a must have for a drink!

Champagne Sangria- let me say that for $4.00, this drink is absolutely worth it and more (it's that price only on taco Tuesday I believe). If you want to get tipsy for under $10 on a Tuesday, then buy this! It's not too sweet and the champagne really gives it a nice fizz. There was just a few pieces of fruit (strawberries & blueberries). 5/5

Spicy Brazilian Taco- my 3rd favourite taco! It had some great  spices and flavours going on. The cook forgot to put the fried jalapeños so the waiter brought out a bunch in a bowl. However, they were neither crispy nor hot this not bringing anything else to the flavour of this taco. It was still delicious, but had potentiometer to go higher if the jalapeños were freshly fried. This is a very filling taco so if you order 2 of these, you may feel satisfied. 4.5/5

El General Taco- My least favourite taco. This was a little bit too blackened for me. It was more salty than I would have liked, but I guess you should expect that when ordering something that has a blackened component. This was also another filling taco. 3.5/5

Thai Chicken Taco- my 2nd favourite taco here! It was delicious! The chicken was nice and juicy, the peanut sauce was delicious, the carrots, wontons and mango added wonderful texture and freshness! 5/5

Pollo Cubano Taco- my 5th favourite taco. This was a controversial dish for us. The first time we came, the chicken was very dry and the sauce was not that good. This time was much better! The chicken was very juicy and flavourful and the avocado sauce had more freshness than before but could still use a bit more spices in it. 4/5

Hot & Crunchy Tuna Taco- my favourite taco! If you want to have some thing light, this is it! The tuna is seared and very fresh! It's not actually spicy hot, but it's delicious and flavourful! The cucumber and jicama mix add even more freshness to it. It's like you're having a tiny poke bowl! 5/5

Carne Asada Taco- my 4th favourite taco! This was a good taco, definitely not controversial in its flavours! If you don't want anything too salty and too spicy, this may the least inoffensive one! The cilantro, lime and jalapeño mix gave a nice freshness to the taco. 4/5",2021-01-28 05:45:38,610,2893,

Fast forward to Now, my husband and I both ordered Tokyo fries & a bowl. Tokyo fries are amazing and that crunch was everything. I did love the added sauce and seasoning as well. If you don't like a kick of spicy, make sure to ask for it on the side or just leave it off. Eel sauce is a great sweet option for you. This really was a fun option considering I don't usually see this at Poke places.

I do love that Poke Burri has different options besides their bowls and burritos. Those options are their sushi donuts, sushi dogs, & poke pizza. There is other secret menu goodies, but that may be different depending on location.

For my meal, My tuna and salmon bowl were pretty good. I loved the pieces of poke. I think the pieces were bigger but there wasn't too many. I tasted heaps of sauce for the most part but I would have liked to taste more poke. I wish I caught that in the reviews then I would have asked for it on the side. I had tons of rice left too. I'll be making more poke bowls at home with it bc I did love that sticky rice.

My husband had a chicken bowl. I'm glad there's one option for him. Often times poke places don't have an option for the non poke eater. He was happy.

We ate our food there, and the smell with the cooking/frying is pretty strong. I did leave with watery eyes and the scent in my clothes.

I would love to try from their secret menu in the future. I hope there will be even more options from it! Pineapple poke bowls and ube ice cream sandwiches would make me happy!!",2021-01-21 20:04:35,382,1725,

We called, only to let it ring for 3 min and nobody answer. So we called back for the next 2 hours, ro no avail.

When I got there, he inspected the vehicle and took the plates off of it, but then told me that my account was flagged in the system. He then called GMAC to find out that they are closed in observation of the holiday. I am not sure why you, 1) Don't know your brand financing center is closed for the holiday, and 2) Why you didn't ensure all due diligence was done prior to said appointment. When I became justifiably irritated and I said I was not coming back another day, he tried to place the blame on me, saying I made the appointment through someone else(which was untrue). When I left, I made it a point to stop in John Barlow's office and make him aware of what had just happened. *Disclaimer- I have been a customer of Barlow GMC since 2014. This was my third leased vehicle with the dealership*. 

I explained that I had already purchased another vehicle elsewhere. He said that was fine.... and then said, ""You know what, we will not do the lease turn in"", and I needed to LEAVE and TAKE the vehicle with me. I refused and explained that I made an appointment two days prior and at no point was I informed that the account was flagged. I had called GMAC and was on hold 3 days prior.. I had the accurate account information, confirmed the last payment had been received ,and was made aware that I needed to call and arrange for return.  

I proceeded to leave, as instructed, at which time John came out into the parking lot and again demanded I take the car with me. Maybe he should have talked to Dave Barlow, because he took the tags off and had both keys in his possession. He insisted on yelling at me and said, ""Who do you think you are?!"" I replied ,""Have a great evening"", and he continued!  

I cannot believe this man is 
Management, running out of a dealership and threatening me while he took his mask off to berate and demand that I take back a vehicle, in which I already made the proper arrangements two days prior to return! They did not provide me with any paperwork and now I have to be inconvenienced to deal with their financing, and hope & pray that they do the right thing and arrange for it to be picked up! 

Unprofessional and serious customer service/ management deficiencies at this location. I bet If I had bought another vehicle from them, they would have bent over backwards to make the sale.

I knew I was going to love this place when it said on the menu that they would not cut their pizza into squares.  I understand Sicilian or Detroit Style Pizza being cut into squares, but unless you're serving five year old kids, thin crust pizza should be served in slices.  I've been wanting to try this place, but it is way on the other side of Indianapolis.  I must say that it was worth the drive over there.  First of all, be forewarned that it is carry out only right now.  There is no outdoor or indoor dining.  It smells fantastic when you walk in the door.  Now, I judge a pizza place based on a traditional pepperoni pizza, so I ordered a 16 inch pepperoni.  I was also intrigued by their Garden State Pizza, which includes a sweeter, chunkier tomato sauce, fresh basil and mozzarella and I love pepperoni breadsticks, so I had to get an order of those.  Needless to say, I had enough food to feed a small family.  Now I always order my pizza a little well done.  In Connecticut, we like our pizzas cooked longer.  I forgot to order it that way, but relieved when I got it home and saw that it looked perfect, and it was!   The crust was perfectly thin.  The tomato sauce was great, perfect amount of cheese and pepperoni.  Definitely the best I've had in Indianapolis or anywhere else in the Midwest.  The Garden State Slice was very good, and a nice change of pace.  I don't know if I'd want more than one slice, because it is so sweet.  But I'm glad I got one, because it is exceptional!  When I think of breadsticks, I think of like Olive Garden Style, I was not expecting breadsticks half the size of baseball bats!  They give you a choice of marinara or cheese sauce.  I went with the marinara.  They were so good, but I will only order one in the future, because four of these could feed four to six people.  And the people there are very nice.

Then I told him, ""please make sure you guys use proper protocols when you receive a gluten free order because I'll be sick for several days after only a few bites.""

I got there at 5:55 pm and stayed in the line for 10 minutes, once I got to the ordering speaker I anonouce I was picking up my order. The voice said pickups must come in side. Have to wait another 5 minutes to get to the window and I showed my order for pickup at the window but I  was rudly instructed to go park and come in. Once inside they could not find my order. They called assistant manager and he said they don't have  my order then the manager came and I showed my cell with the order that was placed and payed for online. After they fumbled through the computer and receipts that were by the register he said they don't have the order but he'll get the order once the new batch of regulars come out in 30 minutes. He left the store after 5 min and I  asked if he had made sure the help knew what to do. .are the story short the new batch came out and they started serving new customers that came after me.  I called the assistant manger and inquired zabout my order after Lagann saying they don't have  the order finally they gave me my order after over an hour waiting for it.
I WILL NEVER AGAIN GET POPEYES.

Not my first surgery but the best.  As far as I can  tell it was flawless.  More details as I recover if required but so far very pleased with the care.

----------------
3star Not a fan so far.  My first and inly visit was a disaster so I'm being generous with 3 stars:

1. All the handicapped parking was full.  Actually almost all of the parking was full!    I came alone so I couldn't just have someone drop me ate the door 
2. Eventually found a spot.  Got out with two canes since I didn't have a walker and wanted as much stability as possible 
3. Half way up a slight incline and I hit the stairs.  Ugh.  Had to walk farther to avoid stairs and very impatient people behind me so I stopped to let them pass and had a few impolite words thrown at me
4. Got inside and had temp check and sign in.  Mentioned I was in Odin from walk in and was chastised for nit knowing there was a golf cart person to help.  How was I to know that?  No signs.  No text or email in advance.
4. Got to the doc which was about as far from the Libby as you can get.  I'm nit going to lie.  I was getting pretty grumpy.  They asked for my forms.  I didn't brung them because I faxed them several weeks in advance.  Well, that was unpleasant and yes I was not the sweetest either.  They wanted me to full out another pile of forms.  No. Just no.
5. Concession was to give them my insurance card while they looked fir a 20+ page fax.  Well, guess what?  They didn't take my insurance!
6. I was referred by a specialist at St. Als because I have H problem",2021-01-17 23:06:07,373,1647,

The staff at the front desk was very welcoming and extremely polite and accommodating. However we did not receive this same service from the staff at the ""Market"" and the Gazebo across the street. They were out of beach towels almost everyday, so we had to walk back and forth between the Market, Gazebo and front desk to chase down towels. Many staff members were not wearing masks over their nose and mouth, and did very little to enforce hotel residents to wear masks while inside. Social distancing was not enforced at the pool whatsoever, and nothing seemed to be getting disinfected often. Because of this, we chose to avoid the pool completely. In general, the common areas around the resort were uncomfortably busy, and we spent the majority of our trip at the beaches at the state park a few miles north. Our room had an amazing view from the 17th floor, and it was on the corner so we had two balconies- both with great views. The restaurants at the resort were very subpar and expensive, I'd recommend walking a few blocks to eat out at other places. Our dishwasher was broken and the water pressure in both the bathroom and kitchen was very bad- sometimes the shower would shut off completely while in the middle of showering, and other times it took up to 15 minutes to get warm water. Also, the temperature in our room was very weird at night. We had our thermostat set at 70 for the whole trip, but every night I would wake up drenched in sweat, shivering and freezing cold. I've read a few other reviews where this happened to others as well. Also- there is no beach side service offered. For the price of this hotel, I would expect more things to be included. Such as complimentary breakfast, beach chairs/cabanas, etc. Overall, it was a pleasant trip but I will choose to stay somewhere else if we visit Clearwater again.",2021-01-04 22:16:27,387,1928,

It was hard to find due to the water pipe /road work - had to call (new to FL) - and the gentleman that answered was so helpful and patient (I think he heard my frustration). So glad I didn't give up! 

What a clean and crisp design-so refreshing - reminded me of a bar back home in San Diego. Open concept from outside dining to inside. Bathroom chic and clean. Hand sanitizer available. It's nestled in between some apartments and condos. Actually love the area sans construction/road work. (They need a local coffee shop to make it pretty walkable - just more eateries to make it so you don't have to get in your car- I'd move there). Back to review...

COVID protocols are followed. So refreshing to see an establishment with so many extra steps for everyone's safety - everyone is tired of take out and cooking at home. Finding a place you can go and feel safe is refreshing. We all want to feel like humans with a life here and there. 

Sat at the bar. It was pretty much empty due to the hour - a family on the patio was finishing up. The patio is great as well. Would be nice for a brunch in the future. 

The staff were so welcoming and friendly. The kitchen sounded lively - refreshing. You could hear they were actually making my food and not re-heating something. 

They have a very limited menu (happy hour menu)- pescatarian friendly. Didn't see anything vegetarian/vegan. Guessing you could ask for an Arugula salad, they seem they would do it. 

Started with a Grey Goose dirty martini - hit the spot after driving around. Being pescatarian, I ordered the crab cake with extra arugula and the tuna tartar and a Chardonnay (I asked for something creamy - I was given two tastes - love when they know their wines) 

Can I just say the crab cake was to die for. Perfectly cooked - golden on the outside not even dry. It truly melted in your mouth. 

The tuna tartar amazing as well. I was torn which I preferred more. 

Both were seasoned perfectly-nothing overwhelming or under seasoned. I just needed more pepper for my arugula-personal preference. 

Never felt rushed or did the staff glare at me to finish. I wasn't able to finish the tuna, served a bit after my crab... loved they staggered it. 

Wish I took pictures, next time will. Looking to return this weekend or next. Hidden gem for sure. It's a bit hard to find but well worth it! Looking forward to their full menu and if the will be doing brunch. 

Found a new go too! 

Thank for the dining experience!",2021-01-08 16:07:26,529,2548,

I know in this pandemic we are stuck at home and we are doing alot of zoom... a lot of ponytails!! I go here just to feel good about my self and know when I walk out that I feel pretty.. even in these depressing times it's nice to take care of your self. And, I KNOW I am safe here. 
The entire staff is so fabulous.. The owner has always been so nice to me and my daughter, and I really appreciate her kindness. 

They are VERY serious about your health and safety, from the products they use, to the actions they take to protect you from Covid-19.  The owner, Julie, is absolutely committed to protecting you from the virus. What a nice set up that she's created to protect you!! 

I go in for haircuts and color and know that the color I get is not harmful to me, as she uses organic products. I will go in for wash and blow-dry just so my hair looks nice for quite a few days.. I always thought that blow-outs were reserved for the ""older generation"" .. but not true!! it makes my life so easy! and I know that they are drying it without creating the heat damage that I do!! Also, their blow-outs look so much better than my home job.. Thanks Robin for making my hair look so great last time.. 4 days and counting!! And thanks for taking me in at last minute as a WALK-IN!.. I had to wait a couple of minutes, but no biggie.. I did some shopping for some gifts right in the salon.. very cute, sustainable, and local gifts.. I like to buy ahead and have it available for gifting.. 
I know the nail products are really nice.. my daughter uses them and it looks so nice. so, this salon will be my go to for a LONG time.. 

But the real reason I am writing this is because my sister was in town... she decided to do her own covid at home haircut... not terrible.. but we had to fix it up a little.. Amber did an AMAZING JOB.. Thank you so much for making my sister look sooooooo great.. what a boost to her self esteem!! before and after photos attached!!",2021-01-31 00:07:28,459,2049,

I also lived in Houston for about 5 years where I acquired an appreciation for Tex-Mex -- a wholly unique take on the genre, fantastic in its own way when executed properly. The dinner I had at Casa Tina's fell short of either style. The menu is boring. It has all the staples of a classic Mexican restaurant but is lacking in creativity and the execution is poor. I definitely got the sense that this menu never changes -- a sign of a dispassionate chef. And certainly, the food and presentation are proof of that assessment. The first indication that this meal was going to be a disappointment was the salsa. Casa Tina's will charge you $3 for a cup of rough-chopped, overripe tomatoes playing dress up as a chunky salsa. It is not* pico de gallo, which should not be served as the salsa in a 
""chips and salsa"" appetizer anyways, but irrespective, would be expected to have equal parts onion, cilantro, tomato, a squeeze of citrus, and a kick of spice w jalapeño or serrano pepper. This ""salsa"" is legitimately lacking any other ingredients. If you don't believe me, peruse the photos in their Yelp profile. You'll see the salsa is exactly as I've described. It's not only bland in taste, but it's completely impractical to eat w chips. It's a crime to charge for it. The queso was severely lacking as well and was served to our table five minutes before chips arrived. As a self professed Tex-Mex connoisseur, I was expecting a traditional melty bowl, great for dipping and a compliment to the salsa. This fell entirely short. It was a stringy mess and again, was impractical to eat with chips. Strangely, this was served with soft, flour tortillas. The only way you could eat this queso with a tortilla is if you ripped off a bite-sized strip and used two fingers to pinch some stringy cheese between the tortilla as a sort of deconstructed quesadilla. It tasted waxy, almost plastic-y. I ordered a taco salad and my boyfriend ordered the enchiladas in red sauce, touted as the manager's favorite. The salad was laughable. Typically, a taco salad is served in a fried tortilla that functions as a bowl. This ""salad"" was served atop a hidden tostada chip. I use the quotation marks because this ""salad"" was composed of two, whole leaves of butter lettuce. There were no ""mixed greens"". The only creatures that eat lettuce like this are rabbits. You could not eat this ""salad"" without a knife. The tomatoes were sliced, again, impractically. Chunks of tomato appropriate for three or four bites were served whole. The chicken was actually good, cooked and seasoned well, tasty, but again, sliced for looks not function, in long thin strands. I should have tasted the dressing before dousing my plate. It was much too sweet and ill-paired for the dish. There was no guacamole nor was there sour cream. Sprinkled atop was some basic, grocery store shredded cheese. Very weak. My boyfriend's dish was sitting under a heating lamp for a few days before being served. I refuse to believe it's a manager favorite. If beef jerky wrapped in a tortilla, smothered w sauce sounds good to you, try the  enchiladas at Casa Tina's. The service was lackluster as well. I did give stars for the ambience and location -- which I believe are the only thing keeping this place afloat. Every other aspect of this dining experience was mailed in. You can do much, much better Casa Tina.",2021-01-02 17:59:34,709,3447,

I saw a negative review posted by some guy complaining if he had to wait too long he wouldn't pay for a copay. This prompted me to feel obligated that I need to write a review myself.

IF you're a reasonable and decent human you'll understand how life works and how it doesn't. Sometimes you have to wait for things and that's part of life. I have NEVER once had to wait more than 10-15 minutes ever over the past few years. If I had, I wouldn't complain about it or try to write in my own stipulations on a document and expect them to agree to my terms or I'll throw a tantrum. I make  an appointment, I show up when I'm supposed to and everything is always great. Front desk, doctors, nurses, everyone has always been respectful and polite. If there is a problem, it gets addressed. 

Dr. Michael Kellogg and his wife both work there and are both doctors. I have always seen Dr. Michael Kellogg, who is a very caring, compassionate, polite, respectful, honest, and genuine person. Whether I want to hear it or not, he always gives me the truth or the next best thing which is his opinion on the situation based on his experience. Following his guidance he has always proven to be reliable and trustworthy. Honestly it's offensive to see someone rate this place negatively when I know how great it can be and I am willing to bet there is more to the story than what is being told by someone leaving a negative review. It's sad when someone has a bad experience, most likely caused by their own actions, expectations, and/or some other intrinsic deficit and decides they need to say bad things to bring others down too.

Nothing and no one is ""perfect"", but over the years I can say without any doubt what I've read so far is not an accurate or proper description of what it's like there. The truth is, if you are a reasonable person this place is great. If not, then like probably many places you go to you'll find problems that you'll magnify because your attitude needs adjusting.",2021-01-07 17:09:01,436,2069,

In the Exton area shopping and decided to go out for a quick dinner, wanted something different than burgers and sandwiches so we decided to go here for the first time, and now last time.
The highlights - our server Brianna was excellent! Friendly, professional, attentive without being intrusive.
The chips were warm and fresh, the salsa had great flavor and a nice kick.
We started with the Guac and Queso app. The guacamole was fresh, cold and flavorful, the queso was hot and flavorful with diced peppers.
That's the end of the highlights why I gave 2 stars opposed to 1.
The Barrel Aged Margarita sounded good, but really lacked flavor of any sort. If I didn't know what I ordered, I wouldn't know what I was drinking. Even the worst margarita I ever had in my lifetime had more flavor. It was very diluted tasting. No where near being worth $13. Thank god you can't mess up beer, so I followed it up with a Modella
For entrees we did the build your own combo. My wife had the tortilla soup and the chicken tinga enchilada with green chili sauce. I had a fish taco, beef empanadas and the chicken tinga enchilada and a side of jalapenos. The entrees were served with rice and refried beans.
When our dinners came out, the only item that was hot was my fish taco. The other entrees were cool, not cold, not warm, not hot, just cool. Even the soup, which you think would be kept hot in a bain marie, was cool.
I just don't understand.
The fish taco was okay, but the fish was batter fried instead of being fresh strips. It tasted like Mrs Paul's fish sticks.
The chicken tinga inside the enchilada had good flavor but the corn tortilla was soggy. My wife's tortilla soup had little flavor. The little flavor came from the chicken stock and tortillas, no spice.
My beef empanadas' filling was good.
The first time our entrees came out, my side of jalapenos were pickled, when the new hot entrees came out, my jalapenos were fresh
The rice and beans both had good flavor.",2021-01-07 00:27:23,422,1988,

We hadn't had Del Frisco's in a while and I was craving their crab cake....so Del Frisco's we went.

As I always mention, customer service is huge to me. Our server was sweet and knowledgeable of the menu. She was attentive, but not too much. We chatted with her a bit and once she noticed I was eating for two she mentioned coming back once I deliver so she can see his cute face. Wish I had gotten her name. Loved her, great service! Okay..to the food...

We knew, well I knew, we wanted the crab cake from the jump and it was immaculate. I'm all about fresh seafood and while this is a steak house, the crab cake made me feel like I was at a seafood house; fresh, nothing but the meat, with a little bit of crisp on the outside from how it was prepared. 

For our entrees (I promise to do better about pictures):

I got the Lemon Dill Salmon. It comes with asparagus, but I'm a broccoli girl so I switched it up. The sauce that is on this Salmon definitely makes the dish along with the fact that it's cooked just right. I could've finished it off, but I wanted to have left overs. Yes, it was that good! And by the way...about 3 hours after dinner, I heated it back up in the oven! No disappoints there...

My BF was planning to order the Chopped Steak. He said he was craving steak but wanted something on the thinner side. His go to choice is usually filet mignon, but that's more on the tender side and not thin. However, our waitress talked him out of that and suggested he order the Steak Frites. Good choice. I tried a piece with the chimichurri sauce and it was full of flavor! Definitely a dish to try and add to your list. He paired it with the mac and cheese. I want to go back just for a side to take home to go because unfortunately he had zero left overs. The mac was creamy with just the right amount of cheese. 

Crazy enough, I don't tend to get sweet cravings, which is slightly odd for a pregnant woman (at least that's what I hear). BUT I REALLY wanted something. Their dessert menu was a lackluster for me though. There were 4 options and I only remember two, coconut pie and peanut butter pie. I love PB, but it just wasn't what I wanted. I almost rated them a 4 because of the desert menu and seeing that I didn't leave with one, but honestly our service was too good and so was our food!

We wanted a dishwasher, and had done our research on Bosch, we wanted to know if it came in black stainless steel, and Adrl (salesman and I use the term very loosely) said it came in black, he then said ""shiny black"". My mom then asked again, if it was black stainless steel, he then said ""black is black, they're all the same"". Which they are not, so my mom then clarified she didn't want a standard black dishwasher, she wanted stainless steel with the black finish, she was very clear on this as we were also getting a black stainless steel fridge to go with our already black stainless steel stove, he then said ""oh yes, it's black stainless steel"", my mom then asked again to be sure and he said ""yes it's black stainless steel"".  My mom decided to proceed and then paid a deposit just under 600$ on her debit card. She also asked many times if she was able to change her mind or cancel the order before paying the remaining balance at picking up, and he said yes each time. When we went into pick up the dishwasher it was not stainless steel at all, but a standard shiny black, exactly why she was very clear she didn't want. He then told her that she didn't ask any of these questions, and never clarified that she wanted stainless steel. And then proceeded to tell her that the dishwasher she paid the deposit on doesn't come in stainless steel so she clearly was the one mistaken, funnily enough it does, as we already knew but confirmed after we left this hell on earth. She then said she wanted to cancel the whole order and Adrl got insanely rude, he refused to give her a refund on her deposit back onto her debit card as apparently it's company policy to only refund by mailing out a cheque??!! And that it would take 15 business days. This is insane to me, and should be illegal. If you can take a deposit on debit or credit why on earth can you not do the refund back onto debit?! That makes absolutely no sense and in just opinion is equivalent to theft. They wanted a deposit for their security, so they were protected, but when my mom no longer wanted the dishwasher they had no problem sending her on her way, without her money and she's just supposed to feel secure and trust that this company, that in less than 4 minutes proved they have zero integrity or any sense honesty, she's just supposed to trust that they will honour their word and send her money back?? Why on earth should we believe this? And if this heinous policy of not refunding back to debit is their norm, why on earth was this not verbalized to her at the time of payment? This cannot be ethical in any way, and how it's not illegal is beyond me. I have heard of stores not being able to give cash refunds on large amounts of cash, I have NEVER in my life heard of a company that can take payment on debit and not return the payment to debit. Now my mom does not have a dishwasher, and does not have her 600$. I will be on this company, and posting reviews every day until she gets her $ or the company has been run into the ground and closes their doors. My mom is a senior, she is sweet and she has worked far too hard her entire life to have some lying shady toddler dupe her out of 600$. If I were to take this to the media and after reading the reviews on here I'm not sure I won't, if I were to explain to them that my senior citizen mother was basically stolen from during a global pandemic when no one can afford to be stolen from, I imagine I'll get someone's attention. I don't want one of your lame disingenuous responses on here, I want my moms money, in full, back on her card, not in the form of some questionable cheque that may or may not arrive and let's be real, may or may not even be any good.

When I first visited, they were the most responsive and accommodating dental office I can remember! However, since my initial visit and Dr. Stoeppler's departure, there has been a revolving door of dentists and administrative staff. 

I recently received some...not great dental work by one of the newer dentists there, but chalked it up to coincidence. After having 3 preventive crowns placed and then needing root canals on all 3 teeth within two weeks (one of which I still need to complete), it came time to have my temporary fillings replaced. I had planned on having this done at another office, as I wasn't super thrilled with the initial work, but after speaking with the dentist (who was conciliatory and apologetic) , I decided to give them another chance. I had already taken 8 hours of PTO from work to get my crowns and root canals done (after initially scheduling my crown appointment at 4:00 and being asked that morning to come in at noon instead) so the appointment I had today was scheduled for 5:00 so I wouldn't have had to miss work.

Around 9 AM, I received a call from the front desk asking if I could come in at 1:00 instead--I told them I wasn't able to take off work with such short notice, but could talk to my boss and maybe make 3:00 work. The receptionist then told me that if I wasn't able to make it at 1:00 (again, my appointment was initially offered and scheduled for 5:00 PM), I would need to reschedule ""because the dentist had cancellations and didn't want to wait around for 5 hours with nothing to do.""

I understand the predicament, but I (like most, I would imagine) cannot suddenly take half a day off of work because other patients have cancelled, or the schedule hasn't filled up. I really do like the dentist as a person, so I'm bummed it didn't work out, but it is what it is. Fair warning if you plan on evening appointments!",2021-01-27 18:12:41,409,1951,

I was given 2 black sugar milk teas ( instead of just one!) Besides the Banh Mi, I ordered Korean short ribs which came with a side of rice and a pickled veggie salad. I also ordered a side of potstickers- and when I got home I realized there were no potstickers in the bag. Boohiss.... that is the reason for 4 stars not 5. 
  First the sandwich. Delicious, crusty but light bread with tender beef and crisp pickled veggies, a light chili mayo sauce that had a little kick. Very tasty!
   The Korean short ribs were thinly sliced and tender. There were a couple ribs with little or no meat, but there was plenty of meaty ribs for the two of us to share. The steamed rice side was just right, not too sticky. The pickled salad was very good, not too vinegary, and refreshing. 
  I will definitely be back! There are so many items on the menu that I want to try! I'm thinking a boba tea date with my daughters or girlfriends is in my future, as well.

I called earlier in the day to see if they had availability for a gel pedicure and they said to just walk in. Typically, at other salons that would mean they have a slow day and the wait times would be little to none. I ended up waiting 20 minutes in the front of the store and 45 minutes sitting in the pedicure chair. 

The ONLY covid guideline they follow is wearing masks. There is no mandatory hand washing, no questionnaire or temp check, and I saw someone leave their pedicure chair after their service was done and they just plopped someone else in there right afterwards, not even a wipe down of the seat. They have some dividers up but the pedicure station does not have a set up for dividers between the people sitting, only you and the technician. 

Also!! Don't think about bringing a coffee inside because there are NO cup holders or anything for you to even leave your purse on at the pedicure station. 

I had gel already on my nails and instead of doing what every other salon does and soaking it off, they just went at it with the nail filer. And then when they were working at my cuticles they did not use the normal oil I've always seen used before, just the scraper on my dry cuticles. 

For $50 you get a gel pedicure with a bad cuticle trim, no callus removal ( and I have them!), no hot stones, no sugar scrub, NOTHING EXTRA! 

They also haven't upgraded to using contactless payment during covid and you have to tip in cash.

Also, it is super easy to order for either takeout or delivery (they work with GrubHub and Uber Eats).

I ordered a scoop of strawberry ice cream with toasted almonds and also the Salted Pig waffle stick for delivery. Everything showed up much earlier than expected, and the ice cream hadn't melted, and the waffle was still warm. Yay!

My husband liked his ice cream. He said the flavor and texture were good.

The waffle stick was pretty good. The Salted Pig waffle stick is a chocolate waffle stick covered in chocolate, pecans, bacon, and drizzled with more chocolate and caramel. I liked that the chocolate and caramel sauces were on the side for delivery so that the waffle wasn't soggy. The serving size was quite generous. It was a little hard to eat because of the large stick running the whole length of the waffle, but that would be the only way to make this a portable snack. I found the bacon was a little too smoky, and there was a weird taste to the waffle (I *think* it was either too much baking powder or the presence of too much aluminum in the baking powder??).

On a second visit, my husband repeated his ice cream order, and I tried the Sweet n Nutty pop. I liked the vanilla waffle much better, although I would have preferred a different nut, like almonds or pecans over the peanuts.

This is a fun place with fun food.",2021-01-20 21:30:43,323,1561,

It was getting late so was just happy to find a place to eat that was open a little later. Walking in in this place has a really cool tiki vibe and reminded me of being in Hawaii. They have a great menu with lots of choices from traditional choices of appetizers , sushi, Hawaiian style dishes.  I asked the bartender what his favorite thing on the menu was and he said he loved the mahi mahi fish tacos. So for me hunger was kicking in and my mind was made up. I started off with some chips and salsa and while the salsa and warm bean dip was super good the out of bag chips were just ok and kinda stale and the reason I removed one star. Outside of that everything else was great. Plus the service from the bartender was a 5 star experience for sure. The tacos where the main star and clean see why this was his favorite dish. The fish tasted super fresh and loved every part. Another surprise was the side of coleslaw that was as well super delicious.  I enjoyed pretty much every part of this meal including the cold beer I washed everything down with. This was a great find and so glad I had the opportunity to try this place out. 

In addition this restaurant is doing all the safety protocols that are being asked...including limited seating for social distancing, masks and extra cleaning. So congrats and thanks for doing all that you can to keep us safe. So whether local or visiting this is a great choice in the downtown Boise area.",2021-01-27 23:28:33,317,1563,

On the flip- this is where it stays based on this location. When searching for new tires for my husbands vehicle- first two places that came to mind was Costco (where I last had purchased) and Sam's club. Costco didn't have his size so onto Sams we went. They had what he was looking for at a great price. Initially the guy the took care of us priced them out and we went on our way. We price compared around town and decided Sam's was the right decision. We went back to purchase and they set us up for a late Friday appt the following week as the tires had to be ordered. That day came- tires were in they called the day before and confirmed. The day of the appt came, upon arrival no appt- we must have been mistaken- they stated it was the next week. 

We said okay- went back the next week. The tire guy we talked too that time said it showed the tires were there but no one knew where. They've not been received. It was the day after thanksgiving. I get it- worked retail for years- everyone's tired- no one truly wants to be there and yet- there you are- we ask for a manager whom comes out, with his items to leave. ""Im leaving but I guess I'll see what can be done"". He says the same- tires are there but not received- also points out we're 30 min early- we did this on purpose just in case of a cancellation and also due to last time the week before. Needless to say the tires get put on after my husband goes to buy a special tool to take the lug nuts off his vehicle. Next day rolls around, the front passenger tire is completely flat. The tech incorrectly installed the tire. After another tool was bought we were able to fix it ourselves at home. 

Price was great, service and hassle of it all not so much. Would weigh out the pros and cons before purchasing tires from this Sam's or at least having your vehicle serviced in the service center in the future.",2021-01-05 21:50:05,419,1960,

Let me preface this review by stating I'm a loyal customer of Liberty Tax and have been going to the Maryland Heights location for years. I noticed my w2s came earlier than usual so I called to schedule an appt. I couldn't get through to anyone so I called the Rock Hill location and spoke with Matt. He apologized for my troubles and was more than willing to take me in the same day. At that point I had to make a decision: do I keep trying my old place or try a new location? Since I already had my W2s and he had time for me, I went ahead and made the switch. 
        Upon walking in to the Rock Hill location, i noticed how pristine it was and was instantly impressed. I've yet to notice an unkempt tax place but this one was immaculate! Not to mention, all the stops were put in place for Covid protocol, so I felt even more safe and comfortable being there. 
         Matt was very warm, engaging, and personable. I should mention prior to me coming in, I had some concerns regarding my second stimulus, which I mentioned to him on the phone. As we were going through my w2, he took the time to throughly explain each section as well as give me the proper info regarding my stimulus. Any questions I did have were answered and he made it his job to make sure I had everything I needed. Matt made me feel as if we were old friends whilst still remaining professional. He definitely cares about his job and helping others and it shows. Thank you for taking such good care of me and I look forward to working with you from here on out!",2021-01-16 14:24:19,330,1577,

The warranty company took 8 weeks and multiple contractors to get the system fixed in the middle of the summer, suffice to say we changed our warranty company the following year.

Jewell Mechanical was one of the companies I looked at and the only one who did not seem deadset on selling us a new system over maintaining our existing one under one of their service agreements. With their help we got another 2.5 years out of our old system before it we were finally forced to replace it this month. Being in the middle of a pandemic we were lucky enough to still have our jobs, albeit with a tight budget.

Josh did all he could to respect our budget and provide a quality, modern, replacement system for us installed a week after our old system bit the dust (thankfully we still had emergency heat to get us through that last couple of weeks). His install team was extremely punctual and got straight to work upon arriving in the morning. By shortly after 3 in the afternoon, they had finished and started cleaning up leaving the house just as clean as they had found it. During the entire process, they were happy to answer any questions I had and explain everything we wanted to know about the new system.

After they left we (my wife, myself, and even our cat) noticed a huge difference in how effortless, and quiet, the new system was in keeping the house nice and warm. We also noticed a rattling sound that continued throughout the first weekend of use and promptly called Jewell Mechanical back the following business day. Josh came right back out and that day and found a few loose screws on the compressor from when it was assembled and after securing them the rattling was no more.

We've also used Jewell Mechanical to maintain our plumbing and water heater, and they are just as honest and upfront with us on the work they have done there as well. Finding a service provider that will put integrity and customer service in front of making a quick buck is a lot easier said than done, but we will definitely be staying with Jewell Mechanical for a long time to come, for not only maintaining our existing plumbing and HVAC but any upgrades and repairs in the future as well.

To fair, during previous maintenance visit their technician damaged the entry hole into/out of our attic while inspecting the air handler (it resides in the attic). After reaching out to Jewell Mechanical a 3rd party contractor was sent out to repair the damage a week later at no charge to me, and there is no trace the issue ever happened. It's a big deal to me that those I choose to take care of my home treat it as well if not better than they treat their own home.",2021-01-22 04:29:07,573,2929,

Her attention to detail and professionalism is just outstanding. After our tasting, my husband and I knew that we could relax and trust that she would do a wonderful job. She made sure she understood exactly what we wanted, asked questions when needed, made the entire process of choosing the food and décor so easy, and, importantly, delivered on everything she promised. The chef prepared grouper and vegan butternut squash entrées, and both were phenomenal. In addition to the food, she provided the table settings and linens, and flower arrangements for the tables. Everything was beautiful and exactly as we discussed. Hiring her for the job allowed me to relax on my wedding day and not worry about any aspect of the reception luncheon. Additionally, all of her staff were exceptionally professional and took care to be Covid-safe during this event. Masks, gloves, social distancing and table service allowed me to have this wedding as planned and without worry. 

What truly impressed me was the level of personalization and care Lynn put into the planning. Although it was a small event, she treated it like the most important event on her schedule. Working with her, you feel as if your event is just as important to her as it is to you-- you just know she wants to make your event the event of your dreams, and she does! If you are looking for a caterer, I highly recommend Lynn and her team. You will not be disappointed. Thank you, Lynn for your hard work and dedication to excellence.

If you're looking for a place that's truly impressive in every aspect with an unbeatable dining experience, this is the place. The whole place is very different from their decor to their menu to their plates and utensils. It all works together really well. Like a refined modern art feel with a touch of vintage. It was really cool to experience how they incorporate all the different aspects of service together and serve their guests and how everything is very different but really good. Everything is made in house from scratch. All I knew going into it was that Rocca has the mozzarella cart. I was absolutely impressed beyond any expectations I had. We went for an anniversary celebration. From the moment that we walked in, we were greeted and seated. A waitress came over to take our drink orders and was very friendly and professional. This place has a very welcoming feel yet an air of sophistication and class. This goes for the whole dining experience as well. Our waitress was incredible. She was very knowledgeable and checked on my table many times. We got a bottle of San Pellegrino which the server was very attentive to in making sure our waters were never too empty. It was placed and presented on a small plate. After our drinks, someone brought over a specialty cheese for us to cleanse our palates and open our sense for the food to later be served and did a brief introduction of what it was. The first thing that was made and served after that was the mozzarella cart which was such a cool experience to be able to watch table side. It was all made from scratch from the mozzarella to the tomatoes being cut, basil torn, and garnishing accompaniments and herbs being drizzles and sprinkled. It was gorgeous and tasted so fresh! The next thing to come was the shrimp spaghetti which was a nice take on a shrimp scampi. With a very light sauce, it was the perfect size pasta dish to accompany a main dish and share. All throughout our dining experience, the dish ware and cutlery was changed for each dish and course we had. Things come out to order here as they were ready and we were informed the chef sends them out as soon as they are done to enjoy to ensure they are warm and eaten fresh. Our main course, was the steak. Cooked perfectly, not dried out at all, perfect temperature, and full of so much flavor. This was a great shareable size for two people and was absolutely delicious. One of the best steaks that I've had. It was served with roasted garlic cloves and chiccarones from the outside fat of the steak as I believe they try to utilize and not waste much at Rocca. This was also served with a size of broccolini which was surprisingly extremely flavorful. I am not a huge fan of broccolini or broccoli but I could not stop eating this at Rocca! The flavors were bursting and so fresh on it with a bit of a lemon forward flavor. The spritz was pretty and refreshing with a bit of a watered down orange flavor. The gimlet was a very interesting and unexpected twist. The waitress did say it had an asian flair but I didn't not expect what I tasted until I had a sip. It's a very unique flavor profile with the combinations of cucumber, sesame, and white pepper. Every coarse was presented with an explanation of what it was and presented beautifully. I will definitely be back. My experience at Rocca was one of the best I've had in a restaurant in a wholesome aspect with experience in service, food, and hospitality. I have nothing but great things to say about Rocca and in recommendations. Absolutely, hands down one of the best restaurants in Tampa Bay.",2021-01-11 15:20:34,720,3633,

I received a notice in the mail a few days ago from Verizon telling me I would receive upgraded equipment at no cost because ""the technology that delivers your Fios service is no longer supported.""  The notice directed me to call 888-692-4560.  I did and was put on hold for almost an hour.  When the customer service person finally came on the line, he was pleasant and professional, but he told me that his records did not indicate that I was eligible for any free upgrade.  He then offered to sell me an upgraded service for which there would be additional monthly and one time installation costs.  I said that the notice specifically invited me to upgrade at ""no cost to you.""  All I had to do to arrange for the upgrade was to schedule an appointment.  He apologized but said that he did not see anything on my account that indicated that I was eligible for an upgrade.  I replied that I had spent an hour on hold based on the notice from Verizon.  I then asked to speak to a manager.  I was placed on hold for another 5 minutes and then the  customer service rep came back on to say he would arrange for a call back.  The next thing I hear is the automated hold message.  Not wanting to wait on hold any further, I hung up and logged into the Verizon Fios website.  I clicked on ""Contact Us"" as I was encouraged to do, and then clicked on ""Call Back"".  After answering a couple more questions, a pop up message said, ""We're sorry.  We cannot process your request at this time.""  I tried a couple more times and got the same message.  You can imagine my frustration at this point.

I called the number on the website to ask why it is saying two different things just to be told that they do that to make the customers personally come to the store to purchase the item. Which I had no problem until I arrived at the store. I told the employee (supervisor) that I do not want the Bundle that I am only here for the PS5 Console ONLY!!! Since that is what they have in stocked. The supervisor tells me that he cannot sell me the PS5 by itself and will have to be purchased as a bundle. Which is quite funny to me because before the store opened they had a quantity of 20 PS5 available and just within one hour of opening that number went down to 19. I asked the supervisor ""if this is true, then how did you sell a PS5 before the store even opened?"" he refused to answer that question which I thought was hypocritical on his end. So, in other words employees are allowed to purchase the consoles individually without purchasing the bundle? That is pretty stupid. After he tried to keep selling me the bundles I finally agreed to it. Then he tells me I need to apply for the credit card in order to purchase the bundle. I told him ""NO, I do not. Because the person I spoke to over the phone at the store yesterday told me that they stopped requiring people to have a credit account and that anyone can purchase the bundles now. He then went to speak with the ""manager"" about it over the phone and just stated again that I need to apply for the credit card. The most stupidest thing I have ever heard. I was willing to pay cash for the bundle and it is so stupid how they advertise that they accept all debit/credit cards when you can't even use your own to make purchases. Not to mention I had to wait for about 10 min just for someone to walk to the cash register so I can pay for my item when other employees where just standing around.",2021-01-30 00:45:12,414,1963,

Still the same great flavor of a freshly made bowl of food with great combinations of flavors that I never think of trying at home!

Note that the Garage Food Hall is located inside the Bottleworks on the north side of 9th street and west side of Carrollton.  Poke Guru is on the right side at the end.  

The bowls they offer come in different sizes though I will admit that the smaller bowl was plenty for my lunch (and still left a little room for some Lick Ice Cream across the shared seating area from Poke.)

My wife ordered the Kalbi which comes with a choice of sushi rice or brown rice, and is topped with grilled Korean short ribs, seaweed salad, edamame, avocado, and pickled mustard seeds, pickled pear, and crispy onions.  She would have enjoyed it more if the rice were warmed instead of chilled and a bit clumpy.

I opted for the smaller bowl of the Bowl with No Name.  I chose brown rice (it  offers mixed greens instead), tuna tossed in pickled mustard seed (spiced with wasabi), cucumber, edamame, carrot, green onion, pickled daikon, and garlic chips.  Excellent flavor combo, but if you order it, be sure to get a beverage to temper the ""heat"" unless you are one of those people who loves heat.

You order from a counter and the meal is bagged for easy transport to your table in the common food hall area.  

If you choose the Kalbi, you can expect a longer wait time because they have to grill the short ribs while you wait.  Maybe 10 minutes or so, but definitely longer than if you order one of the other bowls.

It isn't a cheap spot to grab a bite, but the quality of ingredients makes it worth the price.

I would gladly go back to Poke Guru for more!

This location however does not know the meaning of customer service. I arrived just before all drive throughs in the area were packed and ordered 2 bowls and 2 sides. When I got to the window and they repeated the order back to me it was wrong, ok fine, but it took several times repeating my order for them to get it right. I drove away and headed home with the food (8 miles away) where I opened the meals and realized that it was wrong. The receipt was right, but the entree they added to one of the bowls was wrong. I tried calling them to get something worked out - 5 times!!! No answer any of my tries. So I picked up my child and drove back to the restaurant. Waited in line for half an hour and got up to the order board/speaker and very nicely explained what happened to which the reply was a short, snotty and judgey ""yeah, we're busy, drive up to the window"" as if I had done something wrong. When it was my turn and I was there, I was handed a small side box as the replacement. Yeah, I get it, they may be the same portion size (I don't know for sure) but where was any sort of apology verbally or in the form of an entire meal replacement or an egg roll or some sort of olive branch?? I was quite inconvenienced and didn't appreciate the attitude. And the whole meal was ruined anyway because the point of the bowl is to get the flavors from the sauce mixed into the noodles or rice and that didn't happen. From there I headed to In N Out for my child's meal and made it through their line, which was much longer, in half the time. Food was decent but certainly not worth the hassle!!",2021-01-23 02:42:22,380,1719,

We ordered:

Gator bites (for the husband), Garlic Butter Parmesan Fries, and 6 Hot Wings (3 Korean BBQ and 3 Bayou Sweet Heat).

Gator bites: This was all my husband, I do not enjoy gator bites. But my husband said it was really good so I trust his judgement.  

 *As a matter of fact, he said they were so good it overshadowed the mediocre wings*

Garlic Butter Parmesan Fries: I had high hopes for this but unfortunately it wasn't as good as I expected.  The shredded Parmesan was not melted all the way *minus 1 star* which made it hard to eat but on a good note, the fries had a good texture. I probe should have ordered them plain. 

The wings: The Bayou Sweet Heat had 2 chili signs and the Korean BBQ had 3 chili signs but ironically the Bayou Sweet Heat seemed more spicy than the Korean BBQ.  We ordered that one since my husband doesn't handle here as much as I do...we didn't realize it would be spicier than he can handle *minus 1 star*.  

Overall, would say it's a good stop for a quick bite.  I do like the fact that they are contactless.  It isn't an actual sit in restaurant though but there is a table right outside.  Just ONE table.

My friends and I went there on a Tuesday late night and had very friendly servers prepare our food beautifully. The presentation was very nice but unfortunately, the taste did not match the presentation for most of the products. The servers were so sweet and brought us out free samples of popcorn. 

Gimme S'more Bubble Waffle- vanilla ice cream with a toasted marshmallow, graham crackers and chocolate sauce and pieces. The problem I have with it is that for the price, the quality has to really match. The ice cream and chocolate isn't that great to make the layer profile of this ice cream creation well worth it. The waffle was only outstanding part of it. Everything else was average. 3/5

Tough Cookie Bubble Waffle- pretty much cookies and cream/Oreo based. Chocolate waffle, cookies n cream ice cream, chocolate sauce, regular and mini Oreos with a whip cream. My comments are the same as the gimme S'more. They did the waffle right, but the other layers (mainly the ice cream) were just average. It felt cheap for the expensive price. 2/5

Candy Bar Waffle Pop- crispy chocolate waffle (really great texture) with peanuts, melted chocolate, caramel and chocolate sauce. Pretty much a snickers bar! I thought this was a bit sweet but overall pretty nice. 3/5

Crunch Berry Waffle Pop- crispy vanilla Waffle  topped with white chocolate, corn flakes, maple syrup and a blueberry compote. This is amazing and the best treat they had. The corn flakes gave an amazing crunch and the blueberry compote added a nice light sweetness to it. 5/5

Chocolate Bubble Bites- I thought these would be more crispy than they were. 3/5

Caramel cheese popcorn- this was good except the samples were dry. I don't know if it was a one off thing. 2/5

Birthday cake popcorn- Im not the biggest birthday cake flavour fan in the first place, and this pop corn didn't turn me into one either. It was too sweet, and the samples were dry also. 2/5",2021-01-08 05:56:17,402,2035,

We arrived around 5:30pm and we were seated in the large dining room w/only 2 other people being seated at the time. It took several minutes to get someone to the door to seat us. From beginning to end it was a disaster. The wait staff was rude and rushed us along on our drink order. We ended up with water as they had not even given us a menu to see what offerings they had. We started w/a few dim sum items to see how this was going to play out( glad we did). We waited approximately 45minutes to get our first appetizer. It was spring rolls and they came out cold and felt like they were straight out of a box. As we sat there, the place started filling up in the front waiting area. They sat people and just left them, they had carry out orders that Uber drivers, ect were trying to pick up and were left standing for long times awaiting their food orders. We were never checked on again and ended up leaving as we never saw our waitress again and they would go to kitchen w/o coming back out for up to 20 minutes at a time. We were there a total of 2 hours and 10 minutes and only got delivered to table the 1 cold appetizer. I will never go back to this establishment.

vWnHbo0MiBockpWOKdz0Tw,h7p-GuaHFGsiKCF4g6Bjqg,YpJTxfEiXfH3iC9md0zIDg,4,16,2,9,"After a very good dinner (via takeout on the Toast app) from Cafe Roze last night (for my birthday!!!), I felt I had to update my first review of Cafe Roze from 2019. That first review was three stars, and I think I was just a little underwhelmed because there are so many good restaurants in Nashville.

But after a second meal at Cafe Roze, I felt I was a little harsh! Cafe Roze offers something a little different from the other good restaurants in Nashville. The entrees on the menu are simple but influenced by classic European cuisine - reminiscent of Parisian bistro fare. The smaller plates seem more Middle Eastern- and Asian-inspired and spiced. Because of COVID, we didn't eat in last night, but I remember that the restaurant is tiny and has rose gold, ivory, pink Parisian bistro vibes (that long mirror behind the bar!!!). 

For starters, we tried two salads. The first was their winter salad (fennel, celery root, Asian pear, and anchovy Caesar), which was good but not a highlight of the meal. The other salad - shaved celery salad with ricotta salad, hazelnuts, and preserved lemon vinaigrette - was amazing - one of the highlights of the whole meal - and we fought over it a bit (it was my birthday meal, but I shared). We might be trying to recreate that preserved lemon vinaigrette at home soon - it was that good. 

We also shared two entrees. The first was their paprika chicken (a play on the Hungarian chicken paprikash, a dish I love) - chicken on the bone with crispy baby potatoes and kale. The surprise of this dish was that we loved the vegetables under the chicken almost as much of the chicken itself - how did you do that, Cafe Roze? We also tried the simple pasta (which is as promised - very simple), and who doesn't want a bowl of pasta with just a little cheese and pepper for their birthday, right? (They were out of their pork schnitzel last night, but I definitely would have struggled with whether to order that as one of our two entrees since I remember it being close to great the last time I had it. You can't get schnitzel at very many restaurants in Nashville!)

They only had one dessert available on Toast last night (and it was listed in their bodega section, rather than their dinner menu section); it ended up being a chocolate cake with espresso mascarpone, caramelized banana, and cocoa nibs. Full disclosure - I'm not really a sweet dessert, chocolate, or cake person (I know, I know - I'm a total freak). I wanted a dessert for my birthday, but this particular isn't really my thing. However, it was definitely my husband's thing. He loved it. So if you're a chocolate/coffee/cake person, this dessert might be right up your alley. 

As of January 11, 2021, I believe they are open for dine in. However, it's a tiny restaurant and with the numbers where they are, I felt much more comfortable ordering takeout. They are on Toast, which is great, because they get to keep a lot more of the money we pay than if they were on Postmates/UberEats/DoorDash/etc. Unlike some restaurants on Toast, you can set up an order for later in the day (something I really appreciate). Overall, it was very easy to order/pickup from Cafe Roze. 

Our meal last night was a great birthday dinner (even as takeout). It was simple, Euro-inspired, and offered a few surprises (who would have thought a celery salad could have been one of our favorite bites of a meal?!)! It offers something a bit different than a lot of other great restaurants in Nashville. If you haven't tried it, check it out. If you've been before, but not in a while (like us), give it another shot. Cafe Roze might surprise you!",2021-01-12 14:49:43,776,3634,

I love coming here on Sundays to enjoy the $15 bottomless mimosas. You pour and pick your own garnishes and juice. How could you not love that?!
The service is always on point. They have had the same staff here for quite a while, you will often see the owner working behind the bar as well. They have both indoor and outdoor seating.
The Sweet Thai Chili wings are my favorite. A bit of heat and great flavor!
The best part about this place are the monthly drag shows. So fun! Check out their Facebook for the schedule. I mean the queens are crude and love to make fun of the crowd, but it IS SO FUN. Grab some tip money before you go. 
Still a dedicated parking lot, but would suggest getting there early for a spot. There is plenty of parking on central ave as well. Very close to other fun spots such as Swingers. 
Please keep in mind that this is considered the ""gay"" area of town when bringing family and friends from out of town. And I mean that in the kindest way possible. Nothing extreme, it just may be a little different than what some are used to. I bring my 70 something year old ""Florida parents"" here and they love it. 
I promise you will not be disappointed visiting Old Key West. I come here almost every Sunday and they are the best!",2021-01-25 21:32:06,306,1414,

The interior seemed very modern as you would expect of a restaurant in such an affluent part of town. 

I ordered a cinnamon roll and the bonuts as I love to try different things, even if I can't finish it in one sitting. The Princess sounded the most appealing as I am a huge fan of Nashville hot chicken. My boyfriend ordered the Southern Bennie. 

The chicken in the Princess was easily the best part of the whole meal for me. The dark meat is so juicy with amazing flavor that comes through every crunchy bite! They don't mess around with their cinnamon roll either as it has a nice crispy top to it and the cream cheese icing is not overly sweet!

The bonuts were okay... the marscapone cheese on top was too much and I honestly just felt like I was eating a piece of cheese. Even the blueberry compote on the bottom wasn't able to balance it out. I could also tell it was not made with fresh blueberries and it was not sweet enough to balance the massive amount of cheese on top. I actually took some of this home and put maple syrup on it to make it more appetizing. 

The biggest disappointment is in the name itself: the biscuit. So dry, flat and flavorless. This is a staple of southern food and the fact that this was skimped on truly affects this review. The square cut does nothing for it and it seemed like a poorly baked pita chip. 

I'd give this place 3.5 stars if I could because it has so much ""hype"" but the food doesn't completely live up to it. If your name has a certain food in it, that should be the one that gets the most attention.",2021-01-02 04:17:27,350,1689,

As having a newly diagnosed gluten allergy, finding compliant restaurants is not easy! This was a total win! It's not easy trying to find a place that will cater completely to an allergy. This was the first place in Tucson that we weren't holding our breath the whole meal, waiting to see if he'd have a reaction. 

We both opted to have sandwiches, as I really wanted to try their bread. I ordered the reuben on ""rye"" bread. Everything about the sandwich was delicious. The bread crumbled a bit more than a gluten bread, but after the luck I've had in the kitchen, this definitely knocked the ball out of the park. The sweet potatoes on the side were perfectly cooked and crunchy with just enough salt. The cheese, meat, and sauerkraut were all lovely. 

My husband opted for the Italian sandwich special, and my gosh, I wanted to just eat the bread after taking a taste test. Everything about his sandwich was on point. He seriously was all smiles. He did order the chili, and he said it was a bit too tomato-y. But the sandwich was so good, he didn't mind the chili with it. He ate every last bite. 

Though the prices are a bit more than a typical sandwich joint, it was well worth it. If you're looking for an alternative, this is a place for you, whether or not you have Celiac's or a gluten allergy. 

But rest assured, if you do have an allergy, you don't need to worry about cross contamination. They don't allow any outside food or drink, and every item is gf. 

Thanks for a wonderful Sunday treat! Will definitely be going here more often.",2021-01-31 21:20:04,348,1609,

Had the chance to stay here this past week and really enjoyed it. First thing you see walking in is how bright and wide open it is. All of the staff was extremely helpful and friendly on all aspects. It is also so centrally located that you can pretty much walk to anything whether it's downtown, Boise state or walk around the beautiful grounds of the capital. 

The rooms are very spacious and equipped with all the creature comforts of home. Like a refrigerator, stove, microwave, larger kitchen, eating area, living room and king sized bed.  My room felt more like a large studio apartment hence the name Home 2 Suites.  Another feature that I really liked even though they charge for parking because the parking for the hotel is owned by another party. But as you pull into the parking garage you can park on your floor of stay and walk right into your floor for such ease and convenience. Disclaimer you do have to use your key card to get into and out of the parking garage including the feature of using your digital key. So as far as safety I felt very safe based on these and other security measures. In addition they  do offer breakfast but not  in the tradition way. Everything is individually wrapped for the current situation but still a great job. Because I have been to so many hotels that don't offer anything anymore. So awesome job to the management and staff! 

Lastly the gym/fitness space here is incredible and has anything and everything anyone could use. Lots of space, fresh towels and filtered water. Plus lots of space to spread out so you don't feel so cramped as you do in a lot of other hotel gyms. Also you can tell how much cleaning they do every piece of gym equipment was sparkling and shiny. Plus in addition a great indoor pool area with cool little slide and play area for the kiddos. 

I would highly recommend staying here on your way to anywhere or staying in the Boise area...or if anyone needs just a change of scenery for the night this is a great choice!",2021-01-27 16:46:40,412,2070,

The girl that does them Kayleigh was not there so I was shuffled to whomever was available. The woman who did my nails was nice, but I do not think she is experienced in performing dip powder application. My nails were long and I asked her to cut them and make them square as you can see from my photos they are nothing of the sort. Back to the dip, it was excessively thick and my nails looked bulky,lumpy, and thick. She had to use a drill to shave off a lot of the application to make them look presentable. She also cut my finger. After she was done, I spoke with the manager to tell him I was not satisfied with the work and my finger got cut. I showed him the spots on my fingers where dip is all over my finger and not just the nail, and also my finger got cut by the tech. He did absolutely nothing said it would wash off and they looked fine. He rubbed oil on them and said see its fine. He did nothing, no apology no discount for me being cut. So I came home, washed  my hands, used a nail brush to scrub thr access gunk off my fingers and under, and this is how they look. Even my pedicure doesn't look great. I like my nail tech Kayleigh, but the way the owner just disregarded my concerns is not good business. He was so distracted with playing on his phone instead. I don't want to support people who mistreat their customers. He could have offered a discount and an apology especially when I spend almost 100.00 every 2 weeks.",2021-01-02 01:25:45,328,1521,

I came here during Christmas week visiting my family. It was suggested to try this place so my mom, family friend and I stopped in on Sunday for brunch.

It was cool outside so no one was sitting outside on the patio, but I imagine sitting on the patio in the spring or summer would be nice since you get a nice view of the riverfront. We sat inside at one of the booths, and were socially distant from our nearest neighbor, though I did notice some tables that were closer than I would have preferred, but since my table was good, I was good!

Since I had just gotten off a plane a few hours earlier, I started with an americano with bourbon; I later moved to a Manhattan for the rest of brunch. It was perfect. We started with biscuits and I decided to get the chicken and waffles with hot chicken. OMG it was so good!!! Let's start with the biscuits which were perfectly flaky and tasted delicious with their homemade jam. Then my chicken and waffle.....woo so good. If you like sweet and spicy, get the chicken and waffle with hot chicken. It had a kick! If you aren't a fan a spice, stick with the regular. My mom ended up getting a waffle with a side of fruit, which was perfect for her since she doesn't eat too much. My only regret is that I did not get a side of grits.

I would like to come back here when I'm in town to try some of their other breakfast items, and also to try their dinner picks. They have oysters and I would love to come grab oysters and a cocktail when I'm in town again.",2021-01-01 18:17:37,333,1520,

The owner is a native Italian, and makes all of his pasta completely from scratch, by hand! Hand-made noodles add so much amazing flavor and texture to a pasta dish, and it's so rare to find someone who still makes Italian food this way. My wife had the Pappardelle with a truffle butter sauce and Italian sausage...WOW!  It rivaled my all-time favorite Italian dish at E Tutto Qua in San Francisco! I got the Fusilli with bolognese sauce and sausage, which was also very tasty! Dinner is served with fresh bread and butter. If you're offered the fresh-made compound butter with herbs, don't pass it up. It's delicious. 

As is traditional at many authentic Italian small restaurants (although very rare outside of San Francisco and New York), the owner came to our table to chat with us for a bit. In his beautiful Old World accent, he regaled us with stories from his childhood back in the old country. He's been making pasta by hand since he was a boy, and will delight in introducing you to his family through an old black and white photograph hanging on the wall. It was perfect! As of January 2021, the restaurant isn't yet serving alcohol, so bring your own wine and let the owner charm you as he opens your bottle with his cherished old corkscrew, which he'll proudly declare has opened over a thousand bottles in its lifetime.

Ehk-96wUdDwQ2lBZBpDMwA,WnXaWyR4SmzJI2j3ZWejUQ,GfRhcofYZGPP4iRXe-Vw8w,1,1,0,0,"On Thursday evening, January 29, I entertained some potential future clients to the Fowler Ave WOB location. I decided that this would be the best place in the area to host my future clients for a few drinks, and appetizers. I will start my review off by saying that I concur with other reviews in regards to the food being mediocre. However, the food is not the reason why I am writing my very first review, ever. The reason behind my one star and what is going to be a negative review is not due to the food, it is due to the unpleasant service that my party and I received while sitting on the outside patio. I am not sure if it was too cold for our Server to come outside, but our server would only visit our table to ask if we needed anything and/or to refill our drinks only every 15 to 20 minutes. There were numerous times that my entire party would constantly be sitting and waiting with an empty glass which would result in me having to find the server and ask for her service, and when I did, the Server would complain that she has 12 tables and that she is currently too busy. There were two separate occasions that she would take a drink order from us and not ring in the ticket, or completely forgot our order. I can't say that I have ever received this kind of service, or lack thereof. 

Moreover, despite the horrible service that we received while sitting on the outside patio of WOB, my party and I did our best to be patient, and understanding. But I do not think that was enough for our Server.  Unfortunately, on our last delivery of beverages our server slammed the drinks on the table and said thank you for your patience. It seemed to be sarcastic and rude. From there we took the hint that she did not want to serve us, therefore, I paid our large tab, and even though the WOB server completely neglected us, I still left her a very reasonable tip. 

My party and I decided that we should continue the rest of our business venture inside of the restaurant and this is where I completely lost all respect for WOB. Please let me emphasize that my party was not loud, they were not rude, everyone was patient with the server, and we never once complained to the server or the on duty Manager. 

Once my party and I sat down on the inside of the restaurant, we sat there for 15 minutes without anyone coming to our table. So we decided to help clean the table from the guest before us and we moved all of the old glasses over to the bar, and at this time she yelled us that we cannot put them there. So we moved them back and asked her if she could provide us with drinks because we have not seen a server in the last 15 minutes. The Bartender said that she would find our server and have come by. At this time our original server from the outside patio was asked by the Bartender is we take our table, and at this time her reply was ""NO I WILL NOT SERVE THEM."" I was in disbelief hearing this come from the Server that I tipped very well even after the horrible service that she provided me with. My party and I waited an additional 5 minutes (30 min at the inside table) and wait and see if someone would take care of us, no one ever did. My party and I decided it was time for us to leave and walked out. 

I could understand receiving this type of service if my party was out of control, loud, rude, drunk, or just being bad guest. But we were great guest, and did not deserve the treatment that we received from the Server or the Bartender.",2021-01-29 16:11:45,730,3467,

It's good, very good, and this type of food is hard to come by around here. I've had gyros, shawarmas, hummus and pita, and the gyro platter. All great. Now the service. I don't love it. I had a friend visiting from out of town and we came in on a Friday night. The place is BYOB and we brought a beverage. We wanted to order an app each and then order dinner. We were told no that we had to place the whole order at once. Okaaaay. Then sure enough, exactly what we didn't want to happen happened - apps followed by entrees about three minutes later. Alright, we rolled with it, kind of annoying but no biggie. The bill was dropped on our table shortly thereafter and we were told no rush. But then, halfway through the entree I asked for an opener for a bottle of beer (12 oz, so single serving). I was basically told no because we would need to finish up and leave soon so that they could give the table to someone else. Ooof! Really!?! Our reservation was for an earlier time and while the restaurant had other patrons, no one was waiting, so this seemed really unnecessary. I'm not one to sit at a table for the heck of it at a busy restaurant, so this was a first for me. I think we were in and out in probably 45 minutes and we both felt rushed and unwelcome. 

So why have I returned? Because the food really is good and I can't get this food pretty much anywhere else. That is also why I accept the inflated prices as well. Easily twice, maybe even three times, as expensive as the place I went to when I lived in Atlanta and that place had food just as good. The sandwiches (gyros, shawarmas, falafel) are priced okay, but most other items, including hummus, are quite pricey compared to what you'd expect. Good to know that going in. 

Location is great if you want to grab lunch or dinner (take-out only for the moment) before or after a canal hike. There's also a great shaded playground right there, so a good place to eat some more grownup food while the kids play.",2021-01-03 23:50:01,465,2074,
HZ0ih06Qtrlk0faMcnHzAA,-_dkddkIz2_KusAQuZiS6Q,qQO7ErS_RAN4Vs1uX0L55Q,2,1,1,0,"I have been coming to Franklin Fountain sparingly for years; my Grandmother lived on 4th and market since I was 17 years old. So, I will say that I have been coming here for approximately 12 years now, from being a teen to having a family and bringing my child here. Unfortunately, after the customer service that I have experienced over the past week and a half of patronizing this business, I can no longer spend my hard-earned money here. Most of my interactions have been with Hyuntae Byun, and he was very willing to give his name to address this issue, which I do appreciate. I grappled with reaching out directly to the owner or his superior since he stated that he is the assistant manager, and I was only given the info@franklinfountain email, which I'm sure he oversees. So, I decided to bring it to a public platform where my dissatisfaction can be displayed if not heard.

My Grandmother passed away in October of 2020, and I decided to stop by Franklin Fountain for nostalgic reasons because, as I've previously stated, I've been coming here for quite some years now. As a family of three, we spent around $21 per visit for ice cream this past month. I have the dates, which included 1/2,1/15, 1/19(after our anniversary dinner), and yesterday 1/22. These aren't cheap ice cream dates at all. 

My fiancé and I usually order a pint each but never finish it, so we asked about the scoop options while Hyuntae was our cashier. My fiancé asked for vegan Hydrox and vegan Kona macadamia and asked if the flavors could be put side by side in the containers. Hyuntae abruptly and frankly replied, ""No,"" not an explanation, just a ""No."" Okay, well, why not? He then explained that it would be extremely difficult, which we can completely understand. We ordered, and I believe they ended up giving us all 2 scoops, which made our order around $24 + tax, but that was on me for not asking about kid sizes.  

The next time we visited, our cashier was Hyuntae again. Upon being greeted, I asked, ""Do you have kid sizes,"" now the establishment sells milkshakes, scoops, sundaes,  ice cream sandwiches, etc.. all different forms of ice cream, correct? Hyuntae replied smug and snarky, saying, ""No, we don't have kid SIZES; we have a kids size."" Again, I brushed it off like, okay, he's just a jerk. I've dealt with people like him, and people like him are not worth an inkling of my energy. It was evident that some microaggressions were going on because we observed him being extremely jovial with the customers ahead of us.  

Then we visited last night, and it was around 37 degrees outside and 2-3 hours from closing. I waited in the car, and my fiancé went up to place our order. He was next in line, and Hyuntae decided to prioritize a phone customer over my fiancé. Customer service or great customer service would prioritize the customer in front of him and place the calling customer on hold. Now, if the customer on the phone was already on hold, you ask the customer in front of you if they mind waiting while you address the phone call. My fiancé asked if someone else could serve him and Hyuntae said something along the lines of ""No, they're all busy"" he's the only one who can take orders at present. Then he asked my fiancé"" if he ""had a problem with that."" Which in cold weather would cause anyone to use an explicative when you're fed up with terrible service from a repeat offender. Now, my fiancé allegedly used the ""f-bomb."" Hyuntae then refused his service after using the word which is fine. He didn't deserve our money. I cannot and will not accept him telling my fiancé he refused to serve him because he didn't feel ""safe."" Especially after he requested to speak with my fiancé again, wait? Weren't you just implying he was a threat and you were afraid? During turbulent times like this, where there's so much racial animosity going in our country, your choice of words is significant and can be detrimental to black men's lives. I take great offense to false implications that can have adverse effects on my family. Since my fiancé knew Hyuntae was having a ""Karen"" moment, he got in the car, and we cleared our heads. I shelved my emotions before getting out of the car and asking Hyuntae for his superiors' information and his name. 

Hyuntae spoke his peace, and I spoke to mine in regards to our previous interactions with him. He said that he could only attest to the interaction that night. Now, Hyuntae did tell me that he signaled two fingers to my fiancé, implying to ""give him a minute."" We are paying REPEAT customers; you should address us as such. You finger signal your employees. You DO NOT finger signal paying customers. You vocalize what's happening and ask the customer for their patience. That alone told me all I needed to know about all of our previous interactions and his respect level for us. Well, I hope you respect this review, Hyuntae Byun. The Berley brothers should reconsider who they have forward-facing for their business.",2021-01-23 17:37:11,1044,4984,

Plenty of parking. Convenient location. Kind employees.

Selection of veggies and produce is great! I really never shop for produce at Kroger because it generally is terrible. Everything here is super fresh, crisp, and decently priced (in comparison to Whole Foods where I normally shop for produce). They also have a fantastic organic/healthy food section with tons of options for gluten free/vegan/specialty diets.

Butcher/meat section/seafood counter is awesome. Pictured here is my absolute favorite item to buy at this Kroger - crab cakes. Generally on sale for $3/each and the best at home meal ever! 425 for 20 minutes then a few minutes with the broiler to toast up the top and it's so delicious. I've been to several Kroger's in the area and this location is the only one that ever has crab cakes. Please never stop that.

This Christmas I wanted to do a beef tenderloin but didn't want to buy the whole tenderloin as offered. I called the butcher and asked about a cut of beef tenderloin and they were so kind and offered to cut me a special size -- whatever size I wanted. 3lbs I said. Picked it up the next day and it was great. Thank you!

I've also ordered balloons for work from their flower department and they did great with that. Really easy to work with them always ready on time.

We had to come to the Southside today so we decided to stop here for lunch. I love appetizers and they have several starters from BBQ Street Tacos, BBQ MAG-Nacho, Fried Pickles, Skillet Cornbread, plus others.

Wings are my go-to and I do love a smoky wing. They offer 8  ($12.49) or 16 ($19.49) to an order. The Jumbo Smoked Wings are drizzled with a sweet glaze or non-smoked Wings plus there are 12 tossing sauces.

Burgers, Chicken, Seafood and Sandwiches options are on the menu. Several of the burgers sounded delicious with tasty toppings (grilled onions, mushrooms, bacon, pulled pork, etc.). You can also build your favorite burger with 5 different sauces to select from. 

I like the BBQ Platter of Pulled Pork with Mac & Cheese and Baked Beans. I'm not crazy about the beans due to the sweetness. Smoked Mac & Cheese mixed with Pulled Pork is another of my favorites. The BBQ Pitmaster's Selection is 1/4 BBQ Chicken, 1/3 rack of Baby Back Ribs, Pulled Pork and Garlic Bread with 2 sides. Another excellent choice for the big appetite.

The ribs fall off the bones and you have 2 options. The House Smoked Baby Back Ribs or Smoked St. Louis Ribs or have both, Double Trouble 1/3 Rack Baby Back Ribs, 1/3 Rack of St. Louis Ribs with 2 sides. 

Lunch is served Mon. - Fri. 11a. - 3p. Choose One Meat and 2 regular sides for $10.99. We had the pulled pork, mashed potatoes and gravy and baked beans. I had the Caramel Apple Dump Cake for dessert which was very good but more of a crisp than cake.

I have watched the continual decline of this Arby's since KMart was next door. About 25 years....100's of visits. I also use to go to Arby's Gulf to Bay and Seminole store off Missouri. But no more. 
Yesterday was the provibial straw. 
The snarky drive thru girl would be gone if I were the owner/ manager. She neglected to give me my Coke as she slammed the drive thru window before I could say thank you....have a great day....but FU azzhole was what her tone suggested. This my retribution for dareing to ask , be sure I get Arby's sauce. 
See it is now their corporate policy to NOT include Arby Sauce, Horsey sauce, ketchup etc...unless you ask. 
I got 32 packs of Arby's sauce....for 1 sandwich. What waste. I actually returned them this morning looking for the manager to register my complaint. The guy could care less. I never did get the potato cakes I ordered either. 

There is nothing Arby's can do to make this right. I don't want a refund. I don't want free food. Looking at my sad Arby's classic....two shavings of some dead grey something on a flat squished bun. So I have decided to put Arby's in the same box as McDonalds. Never again. I have not been to a McDonalds in over a decade. I refuse to put their crap food in my body. 

Shame, I been an Arby's customer since Royal Crown cola RC.... They also spent millions advertising it's the sauce that makes the sandwich.... But now it is not automatically included? 

It's management ....down to the rude snippy drive thru girl. The Gulf 2 Bay store is filthy nasty and so old the bathrooms are outside. You have to walk thru a dirty ashtray entry... The whole building should be bulldozed if you ask me. Sometimes your better off just to start over. Whoever is ultimately in charge of the Pinellas County Arby's franchises...will continue to accept rude employees and poor service.

I predict in 5 years or less Arby's is done. Too many fresh clean competition cropping up. People have options.",2021-01-16 20:49:23,428,2012,

I had so many symptoms of BII but was completely discouraged by so many doctors that didn't believe or simply just hadn't researched it enough. I was lucky enough to hear about a plastic surgeon in Tampa, close to were I live. His name is Dr Joshua Halpern. When I went for a consultation with him I wasn't even able to tell him about all the symptoms I was have because of brain fog and simply being overwhelmed with how bad I felt. One of my symptoms was extreme joint pain along with pain in both of my breasts. Dr Halpern was so reassuring and showed me videos of previous patients that had similar experiences. I remember just crying because it was just nice that my feelings were being validated. I scheduled my explant for January 8th. As my day approached I was hopeful but also a little skeptical to believe in the transformation I was about to go through. However I had the utmost confidence in Dr Halpern. I had gummy bear silicone implants above the muscle. The day of my surgery I was so excited just to get the implants out even if I didn't get relief from any of my symptoms. However, I was about to have the best experience of my life. After I got home from surgery I  took half of a pain pill that the Dr had prescribed. I only took it because I wanted to stay ahead of any pain that I may have.I slept for 2 1/2 hours and I woke up feeling better than I had in such a long time. I had so much energy and felt amazing it wasn't until I was cooking dinner (yes cooking dinner) that I noticed that my joints all felt so much better. I mean 85 to 90%better. It was incredible. That night I took another 1/2 a pain pill not because I was feeling pain but because I was worried about starting to hurt once any numbing from surgery wore off.  I only ended up taking 2 of the pain pills the rest of the time it was just Tylenol. Everyday since my surgery I have been up going to parks to take walks. I am overjoyed at how quickly my body has started to heal from symptoms and right now I'm 8 days post op. I want to thank Dr Joshua Halpern and his staff for the care they take to make you comfortable and confident through this process. I ended up having an explant with enbloc and a recruitment lift. This type of lift was design by Dr Halpern. My breast not only feel and look amazing but I noticed that my breast hurt before surgery and did not at all after surgery. I know that I will continue to heal from this. I'm just so grateful to have found Dr Halpern. I also want to mention that my doctor is Dr Joshua Halpern. I mention this because there is another Dr Halpern in the Tampa area. I wish you all the best.",2021-01-16 20:53:19,568,2688,

I looked up reviews on several Hand & Stone massage locations to see which had the best to make my decision on where I would go. The Glen Mills location had great reviews so I was really expecting a good experience but unfortunately, aside from the woman I spoke with at the front desk, it was anything but. My visit was last Thursday, January 7th and I was scheduled to have a massage with Paul. I hate giving him a poor review because he was a really nice guy, and the circumstances we're currently experiencing could have been a factor in the poor quality of the massage as well. 

That said, although he turned the heat on in the bed I was still FREEZING. Next, I explained to him my areas of discomfort and tension (shoulders, neck and back the usual). He focused on my right side for the duration of the massage and it was at mid-back so none of the areas I explained when he asked previously. I also let him know when something tickled, or felt uncomfortable but he seemed to keep reverting to the same place making for an uncomfortable experience as well. 

Lastly, it honestly just felt like someone was only applying lotion to my body despite my telling him the pressure he applied at the beginning was good, he did not maintain that at ALL throughout the massage. He also completely neglected the majority of my body and honestly felt like I left with more tension and unease then when I arrived. 

I'd like to give him the benefit of the doubt that times are tough for everyone so maybe that had something to do with my experience and the facilities themselves were very clean and nice which is the only reason I'm giving it even 2-stars.",2021-01-11 20:11:13,355,1767,

I went in three years ago for a crown. They kept me there for 5+ hours and tried to max out my insurance with everything they could.  Just because my ""insurance covered it"" they said I needed it. For example like a fluoride treatment that is usually done on kids and teens, not adults they said I needed it. They also overbilled my insurance company by billing for four 3D scans and X-rays I did not need as I went in just for a crown. When I called my insurance company they stated that is not normal but the insurance company didn't mind because it still fell within my limits. 

Now three years later, I contact them because the crown they installed has failed and I was told it comes with a 5 year warranty. They will not honor it first the reason was that I did not go in for a teeth cleaning once every 6 months. Then it changed to they will not honor because I did not get my crown inspected by them once a year. Then they tried to reason saying the doctor that put the crown in has retired so they can't honor the warranty. The story goes on. The office manager Nathan admitted the crown does have a 5 year warranty, but the two lead doctors at this office is refusing to honor it. They simply will not. I asked for proof of any of the paperwork when I went into their office stating the requirements to maintain the warranty and Nathan admitted when he went through, they could not find anything in writing that states I had to do certain things to maintain the warranty. They still will not honor it and he tried to pass me off to a ""regional manager"" that does not have a say in the matter since it's up to the doctors. Again, DO NOT Trust them. Go somewhere else and they will treat you more fairly and probably be easier on your wallet.",2021-01-26 20:03:55,386,1841,

Really down to earth people who do a great job of explaining the different ciders they make.  They let you have samples and they are known for letting you blend different flavors to find your special cider to suit your taste.  I'm more of one to not like sweet ciders so they help you navigate which ones to try.  They are only open so many days s week and they don't open until 5 pm and close early but that suits me fine as that's when I pretty much come here before other plans.  

Parking is a bit difficult difficult depending on how busy they are so I've had to sneak into this little strip center on the road that has mom and pop stores like athletic uniforms, paints, and massage etc but most of them close about when this place opens.  Si I haven't had any issues but I have my legal disclaimer to you acknowledge so let's get that out of the way ha ha..

I've tried most of the lineup and I like pretty much everything.  I'm impressed that they use fruits that are more unique than most cider places.  Passion fruit and mulberry so the tastes are pretty innovative.  They are also not afraid to hop some of their ciders which is kind of unique. 

My favorites are the Deepen which is the mulberry and I sometimes do a half half with the sublime which is the hopped lime.  I also like the pomegranate lime called viva.  They all kind of blend well together ""especially after a few"" so I encourage experimenting and have fun!

The other really cool thing about this place is their pop up pupusaria of Mexican food which has a lot of great vegan options.  They hand make their tortillas and make to order.  I've had both their tacos and pupusas and they are super fresh and they add lots of pickled cabbage and veggies and it makes for a great meal fir a reasonable price.  I usually get them to go and reheat later and they still taste great.  

Someday I'll find a way to take home a growler as I see lots of people getting their glasses swapped out.  Cans are currently an option too but going to cost you $8 per. As far as prices go it's a bit spendy as they are pretty small pours at 10 oz's and they cost around $7 a piece but the good news is they are all pretty strong so a couple are probably enough for most people.   You can also get a flight of 4 for $12. I'm sure the ingredients they are using in these ciders are locally sourced and top quality and your supporting a local business so i guess I see it as providing a sort of tip for offering a cool space  to try out some very good artisanal ciders. They are also a gluten free alternative  to beer so you can bring your wheat free family and friends and have a great time:D Local little  hidden hole in the wall to come and support.

We were seated rather, quickly partly due our reservation. The hostess was sweet and so was the front of the house manager. 

The problem came when I was served food that had pork in it and I'm ALLERGIC. It was their redfish dish with sweet potatoes and brussel sprouts. 
I had already taken a few bites when I noticed it was in there. We quickly grab the waitress, to show her and she said ""no, I don't think we put pork in the brussel sprouts, but I will go check. 
Turn out, there was pork in it, but just not listed on the menu. 
So, now I'm anxious and rush to restroom and try to bring it back up. Meanwhile, my daughter speaks to the back of the house manager. He apologized, and says that he will take care of our 

meal. He also offers to make my daughter a virgin cocktail. 
Because its my daughter's sweet 16, I just let her and her sister finish so that her dinner isn't totally ruined. 
Long story short, I get slapped with the bill, despite what I told. He says that his gesture to make the mocktails for my daughter and birthday dessert was compensation for almost killing me.

It was suggested that share this ordeal with the General manager, johnm.superiorseafood@gmail.com, but after texting and sending an email...no response.

So the consensus among our group was that the food was okay, the portions are huge, the restaurant beautiful and the service meh. One thing that struck us as odd was that our waitress had a waiter shadowing her ... we felt that she was the one who should be shadowing someone.

After reading the specials, we asked what was good...she recommended the egg whites and pancakes. We asked about the Benedict and cinnamon buns to which she said was good, and life changing respectively. She went to leave when I asked if we could have coffee to start, she took two drink orders and turned to walk away when we called saying the 3rd party in our group would like something to drink too ... WTH!?!

We had the cinnamon bun, lemon poppy pancakes with strawberry jam, pork belly benedict, and bacon spinach ricotta omelette. 

The cinnamon bun was nice but not so life changing, I found it a bit on the dry side. The strawberry jam overpowered the lemon poppy pancakes so I just pushed the top one to the side and they were light and fluffy but could use more lemon poppy, the Benedict was okay ... my piece of pork belly was all fat so the fried green tomato was good, needed salt. And the omelette was just okay, a bit overcooked and could use more of the tomato n olive tapas as it was a little bland.. I had asked the waitress specifically if I could get a latte requesting it be extra hot...disappointing that it came tepid and she explained the process as if I didn't know how steamed milk was made and why it was warm. We asked her to ask them to steam the milk a little longer to which she replied it would boil.

Finally made it back yesterday--Hallelujah! Chef Eric is still ruling the kitchen with charm and culinary talent. 

Started off with a new dish, Oyster Pie (Poached Gulf Oysters with Sautéed Leeks, Whipped Potatoes, Charred Artichokes, Oyster Cream & Fresh Tarragon)--scrumptious! Pie doesn't quite describe it, tho, as it's a well-apportioned mound of the potatoes surrounded by a luscious cream broth with all the other ingredients in it. Very different and very wonderful.

Followed it with those Grillades (Sous Vide Chicken Gizzards, Stone Ground Grit Cake, Caramelized Peppers & Onions with Brown Gravy)--simply one of the best dishes to be found anywhere in NOLA!!

I just wish these two dishes came with some sort of bread so I could sop up every last bit of 'em. I mean, I could lick the bowls (and was tempted to do so) but thought best to behave myself in such a nice place as this ;-)

A glass of rose, nicely priced for Happy Hour at $5, perfectly complemented both of these treats.

Ate at the chef's bar and folks on either side of me were from nearby and so friendly (tho they didn't offer me any of their food--harrumph! Lol Seriously, the couple on one side of me ordered the Oyster BLT and the Flambeaux Shrimp--both looked awesome! Two friends on the other side of me were about to tuck into the Creole Redfish Court-Bouillon which looked amazing!)--is there such a thing as a fine dining neighborhood joint?

First they delivered the material to the neighbor's house, then after two weeks of the material sitting there, they finally did the install. The install job was terrible with cracks in the trim and exposed wood. Despite numerous complaints to Power to come fix it, Power started charging her despite their ""No charges until you are satisfied"" policy. After a few months of complaining and trying to get a hold of somebody, a VP finally stepped in and they came out to fix it. Fast forward about a year to this past November, a storm knocked down a huge chunk of siding. They come out in December to fix it, but didn't fix the problem area. Several weeks later they come back, but weren't prepared with the material to fix it. After several reschedules they are finally supposed to come February 12th, 3 months after the incident. The siding wasn't cheap.

Now to my experience. They came door to door offering free estimates and I was interested in a quote for gutters, not realizing this was the same company. Before inspecting anything the salesman was super pushy and having me pick out shingle colors. He inspects the roof/attic and surprise, I supposedly need a new roof and I'm risking huge structural damage and it needs to happen quickly! He initially quoted me $40k for a roof and insulation for my standard ranch house. When I said no, he came down to $28k, with a $23k today only price. He eventually came down to $19k. I hadn't done my research yet and like an idiot I agreed to that price, but I  knew that I could cancel within the next couple days. At that point it was an aggressive 5 HOUR sales pitch and part of me was fatigued and wanted him gone. They don't take no for an answer. After research I realized how overpriced they are and that they were the company that botched my sister's siding so I called to cancel the next day. In order to cancel they had to send a person out to sign documents where I had to endure another 1hr sales pitch and the $17k ""I'm losing money but we want to make this right for my sister"" price. After insisting that I wanted to cancel the manager makes the comment ""Well we already got materials so we're losing money, but we are big enough to absorb it"" guilt trip (Because it makes perfect sense to buy the material before measuring my roof and while I legally have time to opt out).

I started with the donuts which are a little pricey but high quality and make for a great treat! Cheaper (and less calories) than something you'd get at a coffee shop! Then I caved and purchased meals - and never regretted it! 

I don't order every week - but I order on weeks I know that I'm not going to be able to maintain a nutritious diet. What I love about these meals is they taste as good fresh as they do after being frozen. They are filling and far more nutritious than your average frozen meal that you would buy at the store. Again you're looking at $9-$12 per meal - but you would spend that going out to eat and probably not get the same quality or nutrition. You do need to order in advance and orders over $75 get free shipping! 

My absolute favorites are the Mac Daddy (praise be - it is a signature item now) and the Buffalo chicken rice bowl (heavy rotation but not every week). I also love the Cookie Monster doughnuts and the Dirty ol' chocolate/butterfinger donuts.

I am also a huge fan of the MOM Cafe! I love that on weeks I don't need to order a ton of meals I can just pick up one that day, and of course, donuts!

Siding
1) Took months before the job started and couldn't provide an ETA until a few days before. 
2) First day of the siding job they showed up to replace my windows.
3) Second day of the siding job they asked me if they were taking down the previous siding.
4) Upon complaining we were told that inside work was this PMs specialty, this becomes relevant later.
5) Only ever saw the owner when it was time to collect money.
6) It took weeks to close out the siding job, and the way we found out they considered the job complete was receipt of final invoice
7) After receiving invoice we let the owner know we would happily pay once the PM addressed the punch list he had for weeks.
8) They eventually finished the punch list to our liking and we paid promptly

Pull and Replace Master Bath
1) Gave us 1 day notice that the job was going to start
2) It took 16 weeks from demo to completion for a simple pull and replace
3) Almost no communication from PM regarding our concerns and growing list of things we wanted fixed
4) Some of the items were attempted 3 times to be remedied and failed
5) We received an invoice for the final payment, again out of nowhere
6) We paid nearly all of it immediately except $800 with a list of items that were unsatisfactory and that we just wanted to cut ties
7) Rather than address us from a customer service perspective the owner threatened us with a lien on our home
8) We eventually settled on roughly $300 being refunded to avoid the lien

There is easily 1K of work left to do on the bathroom, but I'm willing to pay $700 for this nightmare to be over.

In the end their work quality is pretty good, they lack follow through, communication and customer service.  The items left over are basic things that should be able to be fixed, but I don't want Precision Contracting in my life any more.

Feel free to message me if you are interested in more details.  I'm only writing this because of the threats at the end, we could have parted ways with that $800 relatively satisfied.  The law suit threat was ridiculous and unprofessional.

I schedule an appointment, register on line, fill out all the info, that it was an accident, this and that insurance, claim numbers and so on and so forth. 
I arrive for my appointment, I am to enter all the same information again into a kiosk, alright then, I go through the whole thing one more time.

I say fine, then do one, but you can't bill that to the car insurance. ...
Oh well we can't do a mammogram, we only have an order for one breast and we need an order for both breast, we cannot reach your physician for an order for the other breast. For crying out loud, I have one injured breast, could we just take a look at the one that needs attention please? No, we need to look at both, but we only have an order for the one. I said fine, I'll leave. Well now they tell me I can't leave because they have to examine my breast, but they can't do it without taking a mammogram. I said fine, mammogram the one, we'll get the other next time... I'm about to lose it completely. Finally the nurse (poor thing really tried hard to find a work around) said I could sign a paper that I won't hold them responsible fornot mammograming my other breast. I finally got my breast examined. Yay...
You'd think that'd be the end of it, but NOOOOO... every few months I get contacted because they keep billing it to my regular health insurance and of course they deny the claim with the reason that this was a car accident. And of course payment is demanded, whereupon I give the information again for them to file with the car insurance... 
It's about a year and a half since that appointment and I just received yet another such call. Along with a call to come in for a mammogram... Haha, no way, not at your facility, not ever. Talk to you again in a few months,so I can give you the claim information just one more time.",2021-01-29 21:33:22,776,3419,

I was excited to try the new Chilli Cawfee location in Riverview next to the jujitsu studio. I have enjoyed Chill Cawfee at their other location in the past so I knew what to expect. When I walked in all the guys working there were very friendly and welcoming. They showed me their newly printed up menu and even gave me a few samples of the nitro coffee and a sneak peek of their new Nitro lavender lemonade. It was surprisingly creamy and Tom, the owner explained that was the magic of nitro! He also added that if you drank the nitro cold brew you wouldn't need to have the added calories of a creamer because of the creaminess the nitro adds to the coffee! Color me impress! 

After a few minutes deliberating over the menu items, I chose the Caramel Dream cold brew coffee. It was rich in multiple layers of caramel flavors from the syrup, the caramel drizzle and the caramel chew on top of the whipped cream. This is definitely my go to drink when I visit Chill Cawfee and I don't even regret trying anything new ;)

The jujitsu studio attached to the coffee shop offers many classes throughout the week including Wrestling which appeals to me since my oldest son was a varsity wrestling for four years! I also overheard the owner talking about chess tournaments. They had a beautiful chess set set up for customers to relax and enjoy with their drinks! There are many drink choices including CBD infusions as well as growlers. 

I think this is a great location especially if you live in the Lake Saint Charles neighborhood ... I know if I did this would be my go to coffee shop on a daily basis!",2021-01-03 16:41:06,361,1824,

Prior to showing up there tonight, we made a reservation online through Yelp (super easy and quick) and I had the pleasure to chat with Kurtis who confirmed our reservation as well as suggested we asked our server for their favorite item on the menu (btw, it is a great way to Explore the menu when you're new to it) :)

We were greeted as we entered ans show to our booth right away. I gotta say, their customer service is outstanding. Jose did a great job making suggestions and explaining the menu as well as being super friendly and always checking on us to see if we needed anything and checking how the food was. From beginning to end the whole experience there was exceptional!

Kurtis himself makes sure to come check on us to see how everything was going and even surprised us with some delicious chicken wings (on the house). By the way, what  treat! Be sure to try their JAPANESE FRIED CHICKEN (KARRAGE).
We also made sure to try the takoyaki (octopus fried balls) and potstickers. Both delicious.

After getting to know this place through a Yelp Elite event, I had to have the VIETNAMESE SANDWICH Banh Mi Bolgogi Beef. The combinations of flavor is just delicious. Great treat to split as an appetizer.

For entrée we had the Black Garlic Ramen. It is well garnished and full of flavor. As an addition, they brought us some sauces, spicy on the side (requested) since they usually make this ramen spicy and we were even offered additional garlic midway through the dish in case we wanted to add to it (for flavor)

If it is your first time there, be sure to CHECK IN, and you will get a free Mochi Ice Cream. I recommend the Strawberry flavor. It was a perfect finish.

Over all, it was a delightful night and I have to say, GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE. Thank you Kurtis and staff for making tonight extra special.

Be sure to make reservations because this place gets busy, with reason. The service is amazing and the food is exceptional.",2021-01-21 06:18:12,417,2017,

From previous experience dining in person here pre-pandemic, their interior is also a bit nicer than their other location. 

However, when I visited this location last, the service definitely could have been better. I pulled up to order in the drive-thru one night, but was not greeted by anyone. I figured they were taking the other car's order in the second lane, but after waiting and calling out to the intercom, and checking with the other car, I didn't know if they had closed or were simply ignoring us. I decided to exit the drive-thru and and pull around again, as more cars had starting to appear behind me, but it was clear I was not going to get help. 

Upon exiting the drive-thru, I found that there were two of their workers just standing in front of the drive-thru window, talking with the other handful of staff members, throwing (what looked like fries) at each other, and giving us confused stares as we went to circle back around. Once back in the drive-thru line, the cars that had been behind me and the original car who had tried ordering with me prior, were now getting served instead. I used to manage in food service, so I know how poorly it can look when your team is more preoccupied with something not work related. I wish my partner and I didn't have to try and order twice, if they had not been ignoring us the first time.

We were so happy when we walked in. I was particularly intrigued at their plus size selection as they go up to a size 2x. While I was in the store I also heard another girl mention that so 1 star for inclusion!
The staff was very friendly as well and also told us that there was a Miami and St. Petersburg location which we were so happy to hear.
My only disappointment comes from when we were leaving the store. My friend purchased 3 items and the detector went off. We went back to the counter and instantly the cashier who checked us out said ""it must be the hat."" However, there were sensors on all 3 items that she purchased. I'm still trying to figure out how he missed it. The end of our experience was quite embarrassing to say the least as we were the only Black people.

Update 01/19/2021: I'm not quite sure how to respond on Yelp so I will leave it here. Thank you for confirming the locations of the other two Florida stores. However, both my friend and I know what was told to us and we even laughed and I made a point to sag ""St. Pete that's right down the street.""

The fun vibe, friendly service and creative food and drink made the place a no-brainer. Best bibimbap and signature rolls in town, not to mention the ever changing drink lists! In the past 2 weeks I have been twice, and my impression has completely changed. The menu has gotten... well... boring. Some of the good sushi remains (a lot is gone) but it just feels like they are cutting corners and turning into a Panda Express, with beef and broccoli replacing the Bibimbap and other unique items. Not to mention there was absolutely zero similarities to the fun and friendly service that I so loved. The waitstaff used to look like they loved their jobs and the music was fun and nostalgic. The past two times it's been like pulling teeth to get a smile out of anyone, and I am not even sure that there was a manager working, but they sure as hell didn't stop by to check in. My last server wasnt bad or rude, but seemed completely overwhelmed, and had the entire restaurant to himself. Honestly didn't see a single person helping him the entire time I was there, and he certainly was not having fun. And the ambient music was even more drab than the menu.

He approached me while I was in line to get on the elevator and asked me to pull it up, which I did. A few minutes later, when we were upstairs, I see he suddenly appeared out of nowhere. I had my face mask on and continued to mind my own business until he felt the need to approach me yet again and say he saw me pull my mask down when I turned the corner and if I can't conform to the rules, then I would be removed. This was not true, as my mask was up. My mother even proceeded to hand me a disposable mask to placate him further and he continued to reprimand me, threatening to kick me out. At that point, I told him to keep away from me. I let him know there was no way I was going to tolerate his constant surveillance since I was wearing my mask. When I voiced my concern to the other security staff, they dismissed me and told me it's his job to essentially stalk anyone he feels is not obeying the rules. The ironic part is that he was standing way too close to me and not adhering to the 6 feet distance rule himself. I will never return to this museum, as I paid quite a lot of money to be made to feel like I was a criminal. The only refuge I was able to find was at the cafe.

I love the new Tai Ke restaurant. They upgraded the store front a lot while maintaining some of the previous looks. The hot pot bar looks so chic and legit. If you have a large group though, don't worry, they can still do hot pot at the table. 

I had really high expectation coming into to try the hot pot. To be honest, the hot pot definitely was very good. However, for one person only though, I think  the price is a bit high especially with what they offer. I feel like that would make a lot of people shy away from ordering the hotpot. 

In addition, the menu for the hot pot is not very clear. They don't list the ingredients for each kind of hot pot. They just mention what a basic hot pot would come with. I ordered a mushroom hot pot and it did not come with all of the things listed in the basic hot pot. There were no fish balls and cabbage included in my hot pot. I was so confused and thought that maybe basic hot pot was something else so I did not ask for it. I feel like a lot of people would be confused too, especially for those who don't know much about hot pot. 

My friends ordered sizzling tofu and braised pork belly. As always, their regular dishes were so delicious that I kinda regret ordering the hot pot. 
Overall, I still love Tai Ke a lot and I support them as a business. It is still definitely one of the best Taiwanese restaurants in St. Louis, if not THE best. Therefore, I would give them 5/5 for their regular offerings but only 4/5 for the hotpot.",2021-01-24 16:55:07,368,1706,

Awful waffle is not called that because the waffle tastes bad. It is because well, it's awfully tasty! This place is located inside NoHo Junction at the corner of Cass and Oregon in Tampa. Currently, there is construction so it is a bit challenging to navigate but it is worth it. There is parking in the rear of the building off of Oregon. There is not any signage except and open sign. This entry does not have a sign saying masks are required but their front entrance does. NoHo is like a small food court that has the option for 4 or 5 businesses along the edge with seating in the middle. There was no outside seating that I could find. I only noticed a BBQ place running at the same time as AW. Per chatter the other locations did not survive 2020. Awful Waffle sells bubble waffles (think soft waffles with bubbles like a pizza crust not bubbles like in bubble tea) and flavored popcorn. The waffles can come in bite size, on a stick, or in a cone! I personally prefer to enjoy my waffle on a plate as eating from a cone can get messy. They serve their food with a wooden spoon. No knives available that I saw. They make the waffles fresh and I appreciated this a ton (nobody likes a soggy waffle). I ordered the gimme s'mores bubble waffle and it was too large of a serving to finish myself. I think it is the perfect size for sharing.

Don't advertise a restaurant promotion that clearly isn't true. 

We placed an order through the app and selected curbside pickup. Upon arriving, we saw several people waiting outside for their orders. There seemed to be general confusion about when people's orders were ready. The people there seemed to be waiting for a long time and looked disgruntled. We selected Curbside Pickup thinking we could avoid the hassle. Wrong. Several cars were waiting in the designated Curbside Pickup spots and not once did I see anyone come out to deliver the Curbside Orders. After waiting for awhile (and pressing ""I'm here"" in the app), I had to go inside to check on my order. Turns out they just left it on the table and never even came out to deliver my order or even call my name telling me my order was ready. The order must have just been sitting on the table for a long time without any sort of communication. Why offer Curbside Pickup when they clearly don't do it (or even follow Covid protocols for that matter)??

Of course, the food was already cold since it had been sitting there for awhile. The lid on the cheese for the fries wasn't secured properly so some of the cheese actually spilled in the bag. I tried the Korean Gochujang Fried Chicken sandwich since it was a limited time item. It was okay. Had the gochujang flavor with a nice crisp on the chicken. The kimchi slaw didn't complement the sandwich that well because the chicken was salty but the slaw was also salty...which made the sandwich a little too salty??? We also got the double smoke shack, which was greasy.

It's fast food but it's more pricey and usually has better quality. Because of Covid, only one person can be in at a time to order and then you wait outside and they will text you when your order is ready. We ordered quite a bit and then sat in our car waiting for a text. After 25 or 30 minutes, my husband went in to check on our order and apparently the food was done a while ago and just sitting there. They explained that sometimes the texts don't go through.

There were no straws and our food was pretty cold. Not wanting to be another ""Karen"", we thought we would just make do with it. After I spilled my drink, my husband decided to go in and at least get us straws. Apparently when he went in, he explained he was disappointed in not receiving our food when it came out and it being cold and being told there were straws, etc. He doesn't normally complain, So he felt kind of weird about it. The staff seemed really apologetic and like they had been working hard and it was just an oversight. They comped us milkshakes and went above and beyond to make up for the mishap. My husband came back to the car and we talked about it for a while because it's hard for us to want to ever seem like we are privileged people complaining and whining about stupid stuff. We really enjoy the food here and the service is usually pretty great. We know working in a restaurant is hard, as we both have done it, and especially it must suck during a global pandemic.

I was told ""no"" bc those were for ""league bowlers"". Makes sense to me...the league bowlers pay more, maybe they practice on Tuesdays? No problem.
Turns out, the whole 2.5 hours they were there- not a single player on those lanes? Why would they tell us that if no one was there??

We set our stuff down, there was an issue w our lane, waited in line again, waited for them to fix it, typed out names in... i went to the concession stands to get my $2.88 taco. It was 8:54- I was told they're not serving food any longer bc they stop at 9pm....
I found this terrible because this wasn't mentioned on their website, their Facebook page, or when we paid. This sounds very shady.
However, the worker didn't have any problem making himself a pizza and eating it in front of the concession stands.
We also waited in line for 8 minutes waiting on him to clean the grill for a refill even tho he saw us and we were the only one in line.

When I got home, included with my order was a sealed envelope that was marked 'to be opened by your server'. Having absolutely no clue what it was, or why I had it and what I was to do with it since I did not have a server, I opened the envelope. It was for a gift basket, to be collected on my next visit in Jan. When I picked up my next take-out, a few nights later, the person handed me another envelope asking if I knew what that was.  I stated I did not, so she explained it was a mystery gift and that I need to bring it back unopened on another visit in Jan. I explained what had previously happened and that I had opened my other envelope. Her response... was to simply just shrug her shoulders and walk away.???

Today I went for lunch and again explained what happen to my server, who in turn said he needed to talk to someone else. This woman then came to our table and offered to buy my dessert OR discount my appetizer $8. No introduction so I have no idea who she was. And all she could do was offer me $8!? Wow! That was either a really sad gift basket, or the worse deal I was ever offered. 

After lunch, we decided on NOT making reservations for their next wine tasting, in Feb.

After finishing our weekly Saturday morning run in the park, we began our usual brainstorming of places to eat for lunch. To be honest, I'd been thinking about lunch while I got dressed for the run because I'm easily motivated by food - who's with me?! 

It's been particularly chilly in New Orleans lately (that's sub 50s for anyone wondering) and was really in the mood for something warm and comforting. A girlfriend of mine suggested a 'soup-to-go' place she'd recently gone to on Magazine and a few Google searches later, I was standing outside a 4-person line at The Soup Garden! 

The Soup Garden is currently housed in an old snow ball stand next to the Ethiopian restaurant on Magazine. I got the French Onion and my husband got the Tomato Basil. The soups are sold by the pint for $8.50 and they have some bread accompaniment options as well - we got the provolone crostinis for an additional $1.50. You can save 50 cents per order by forgoing the spoon, a great nod towards all of the saving the planet efforts! The ladies working are kind enough to offer you samples of any of their offerings. 

At this point, the smells emanating from their order window had made us quite hungry. We couldn't wait to get home so we had ourselves a little car picnic. Both soups were absolutely heavenly; the French Onion is made with a generous of helping of thyme and the Tomato Basil is so rich and creamy. 

In addition to their regular soup offerings, they offer daily specials which were egg roll soup and chicken noodle when we went. There's also additional add-ons like crunchy onions, shredded cheeses, bacon (perfect for the potato soup!).

The Soup Garden is only here through Mardi Gras so definitely go check them out especially while it's so cold! And for my fellow Seinfeld fans, it looks like New Orleans finally got its own version of ~The Soup Nazi~ (though, these ladies are so very sweet!)",2021-01-09 20:39:13,392,1926,

I understand that this process might be a bit more daunting or consuming for some people, for me it was seamless and surprisingly easy. I will admit, I am organized and have all the paper work that is needed ocd, organized in my office, this helped the process for sure, I didn't have to hunt. Another thing that helped make my process easier, response time. I never sat on their emails, I would email within minutes of receiving communication.

The story ends like this, use Gwen and her team. They care and they work hard for you. I even received a call from David two months later to remind me that my first mortgage payment was due. I felt this was the rum soaked cherry on-top of the refinance cake.",2021-01-07 15:07:58,359,1704,
vuILakLic7nOcAARsgUolw,wtU-Q1V6__VT7q_rYAiRYg,2njTjQ35skXN171KoobeGg,1,4,0,0,"This venerable Tucson bakery has been a real favorite of our family for over two decades. Delicious baked goods, a mellow environment and sunny patio made possible by consistently friendly and capable staff.

Sadly, it has recently undergone a name change. From here on, call them ""Passive Aggressive Sage"".

Yesterday I made one of my biweekly trips to purchase baked goods for the family.  There were easily 30+ baked-items in the front display case with the possibility of  even more items unseen from the customer side of the counter.

I ordered four of the tiny little Jam Scones which are literally half the size of the regular scones. I then selected two more of the regular scones and was ready to order a coffee rink when the counterperson interrupted me with ""Oh, we have a four-item purchase limit on baked-items"".  She articulated this with a rather snide tone and quite the smirky smile. ""Even though these are the tiny scones?"" I asked. She again replied ""we're a very popular bakery!""

I inquired ""when did that four-item policy start?"".  Initially, she would not reply except to repeat ""we're a very popular bakery!""  I mentioned that I had been purchasing baked goods there for two decades and never experienced such a limit even when purchasing quantities of up to a dozen. With a continued smirk, she again repeated ""we're a very popular bakery!"" and then added ""it always been the policy for the the twenty-two years we have been open"". The second counterperson then sidled up to her and cast a backup smirk headed my direction.

Given that both the counterpersons were toddlers at best twenty-two years ago, it is curious how remarkedly self-assured they are about how this business has been operated over the decades. 

I gave up, abandoning the idea of spending any further money on a coffee drink and left. I felt sad, I felt irritated and I certainly felt passive-aggressively abused by the staff.

Count the former ""Raging Sage"" as yet another civility victim of the Pandemic. Best of luck with their new customer-abuse paradigm!

Give it six months and this business will be filing Chapter 7. The counterpersons will again be unemployed and contemplating their $90,000 student loans for those non-degree art-school certificate programs that have left them so angry at the world.

The Situation: 

A portion of my to-go order was the 6-piece lemon pepper chicken wings. I requested two individual containers of blue cheese dressing for which to dip the chicken wings.

Once home, I take the lid off one of the containers of blue cheese dressing, and I am quickly hit with a very rancid smell. More specifically, is smelled like vomit. After taking a closer smell of the blue cheese dressing, I immediately identify it as the source of the bad smell. I check the other container as well. It too has the same smell.

As a result, I call Crafty Crab to notify them that they are serving what I believe is expired blue cheese dressing, register my personal complaint regarding my dish, and receive some form of appropriate consolation. Emphasis on the word appropriate.

The Resolution:

I spoke to a manager named Jazmine (not sure of the spelling as I did not ask), who identified the expired blue cheese dressing in less than one minute of being on the phone with me. Jazmine proceeded to apologize for the situation. Here is where Crafty Crab lost my family and I as customers. After issuing an apology, Jazmine indicated that she was closing the call. She offered no form of consolation beyond a verbal apology for serving a customer expired food. The fact that it was a condiment as opposed to a main dish should not matter.

Beyond a moral obligation, I had no obligation to call and notify the Crafty Crab of the issue. They should have procedures in place to prevent such incidents. It is a restaurant.

As Jazmine attempted to close the call with me, I asked her if the restaurant would provide some form of consolation for the specific meal. I was not looking for a major refund on my entire order. For example, I would have been fine with a refund of the wings or a free entrée of equivalent price in the future. I also want to highlight that I made the proposal, and the manager gave no indication of providing any form of consolation beyond a verbal apology. After I asked the question about reconciliation, Jazmine placed me on hold. After about two minutes, Jazmine returned to the call and offered me a 10% discount the next time I come in and order wings. She further explained that it is the most she could offer given that there was noting wrong with the wings. 

So, I spend $65 ($65.65 to be exact) with the Crafty Crab tonight, get served an extremely rancid and expired condiment for my meal, notify Crafty Crab of expired food in their inventory, have to ask Crafty Crab for consolation (vice Crafty Crab doing so of their own volition for the sake of customer satisfaction/what's right) and in return Crafty Crab only offers me a verbal apology (which I do appreciate by the way) and a $0.70 discount on an order of chicken wings (wings are $6.99 for an order of 6) the next time I am there.

Thanks, but no thanks if this is what you think of your customers.",2021-01-19 01:14:08,595,2942,

My best friend referred this company as she moved about 5 times over the past 10 years. I was hesitant on utilizing this company but I hoped for the best but feared the worst. The beginning of the process was excellent (i.e. the office staff were amazing and very professional). Fast forward to the moving day, I paid for 3 hours which included multiple stops and 3 movers. Realizing the move may carry over an additional hour, I was made aware of the added cost . I spoke to the manager the morning of, as I attempted to reschedule to date as I was feeling ill the night before. He advised the movers were already dispatched and no changes could be made. I understood and carried on with the existing schedule. The movers arrived 10 minutes early and I was immediately given a packet of documents to initial and sign. I could not provide my full attention on the paperwork as I needed to advise the movers on what items were going on the truck.  Secondly, I noticed 2 movers showed up to move my items. I immediately contacted the office to inquire on the matter. I was told the 3rd person called out and they were working on sending another person over. I did not understand why no one from the office bothered to communicate that information to me. I had to request an adjustment in my bill as I assume if I did not say anything it would have been business as usual. The 3rd mover showed up a hour & 1/2 into the move. Once he arrived, the move had picked up and things were moving fairly well. I noticed several items deemed fragile was placed on a dolly and landed on the sidewalk. No telling if something is broken as I am still unpacking but I could not believe these were allegedly skilled movers. Towards the end of the move, a small table was in the living room. I advised the ""leader"" of the group the table was apart of the move. I was told the item was not on the list I emailed to the office. Once again, I had to contact the office as I sent a tentative list as a courtesy. I did not know I was held to an itemized list of things to move. After the call, I was advised I am charged by the hour and it did not matter what items required moving. I believe this conversation should have been discussed and understood by the movers before traveling to my house. Once the items were unloaded into the first destination, the ""leader"" once again advised due to the small table and box count over the estimated number the charge was $100+ dollars. I again contacted the office as this mover appeared to be on an entirely different agenda than the agreement I set forth with this company. By this time I was infuriated by this so called ""leader"" and the back office. For about the fourth or fifth time I was on the phone with the office explaining my unfortunate experience and had to negotiate a discount price to make up for the missing worker. After it was all said and done I received a discount on the move. Not 100% satisfied but I was burnt out by the entire experience and did not have the energy to continue pleading about my unfortunate dilemma. In closing, I DO NOT recommend this moving company for a local or long distant move. I did not have a good experience and I hope no one else experiences the situation I had to endure on this day. Please do your homework and obtain more than once reference if you are in the market to move.",2021-01-19 23:47:48,709,3466,

They said they cleaned it but it was filthy and we had to spend hours cleaning it.  Within two weeks there were major issues.  They referred us to a 3rd party shop to fix the issues.  We were without the car for a week during the first month we owned it.  As soon as we got it back, it had the same issues.  Back to the 3rd party shop to re-fix the issue and another week without the car.  Shortly after getting it back another major issue.  Back to CarMax Service to diagnose and then referred to the Ford dealership.  We spoke with CarMax customer service and the woman assured us that they would take care of us.  Told us they would handle getting a loaner car and all we would have to do is exchange cars at CarMax.  The Ford dealership called us to schedule the appointment which confused us since we were supposed to make the exchange at CarMax.  We made several calls to CarMax and no one would help us over the phone.  I had to go to CarMax to get answers.  The answer I received was that we had to figure out dropping the car off at the dealership and then go through the process of renting a car and then submit a reimbursement to CarMax.  How is this taking care of us?  Two major issues, a bunch of run around and now we have to take care of everything ourselves?  Do yourself a favor and do not purchase a vehicle from CarMax.  CarMax ""Certified"" is a joke and their customer service is even worse.  They don't answer the phone, you call their out of state customer service, they try calling the dealership and they also can't get anyone to answer.  They transfer you to someone's extension and it rings and rings with no VM.  So now we are faced with dropping off the car at the dealership, being without a car for 1-2 weeks or renting a car and hoping their reimbursement process is smoother than all the other processes we've experienced so far.  Their response to voicing this concern on another site was for us to contact the same customer service number that has not helped us up to this point.  Do yourself a favor and choose a different company to do business with.  I'm sure some people have had a good experience but after personal experience and research, you are looking at 50% chance of a positive outcome.  Not the kind of rate you want when spending thousands of dollars on something you need to rely and depend on.",2021-01-14 22:48:28,484,2390,

You HAVE FOUND him! I am not paid in any way, I have just been through so much and I am so grateful to have him in my life. 

     My story with Dr.Adam's begun in September but If I had one wish, I swear it would be to have met him sooner. My rescue dog Roxy (the love of my life )became very ill and after many vet appointments with a different veterinarian and specialists I had spent well over $7,000 to only find out they were treating her for pneumonia when she had cancer.  When she was diagnosed with cancer, I knew I couldn't put her through any of that pain. The vet I had spent so much time and money with wouldn't come to my house to put my baby to sleep.  It was a cruelty not to me, but to my girl. All I wanted was a familiar face so she wouldn't be scared. I said I would pay any amount and I would Lysol and clean whatever she wanted. She wouldn't do it. Even though for weeks I had seen her in person. ‍ 

Pet Passages recommended Dr. Adam's to me and there it was. An answered prayer in disguise. I was so stricken with despair I had no idea what a blessing this was at the time. I called him and he got on the phone with me immediately. Which was odd because it's always a big deal in other offices to talk to the vet so I liked that right away. Then after explaining what was happening he said yes of course I'll come to you but if you bring her to me I can save you $125. A line I have  NEVER heard a vet say before. He was on speaker phone and my boyfriend looked up like, did he just say he'd save you money?

And I said no, I appreciate it but she's in an oxygen chamber at home and cannot leave. He was ready right away and told me he could come to me that night but I said tomorrow morning please. Give me one more night with her. When he arrived he gave her a little sedation to relax her and went right to her paperwork on the counter. He wasn't eager to put her to sleep, he was eager to see what was wrong. 

What struck me right away was how thoroughly he looked through her paperwork from Blue Pearl. He studied the notes and was asking questions and checking on her; listening to her lungs and her heart and then going back to the paperwork. I knew right then if he could have saved her, he would have. He then said I'm so sorry, but your dog is very ill and cancer... just cannot be treated.  he said he wished I had came to him sooner bc these companies play on your heart when your hurting and make you spend all this money when it's simple. She is very sick with cancer. 

   I have no doubt in my mind that all my prayers were answered that day. Through Roxy's whole life I have searched for a good veterinarian and even though it was near the end, we finally found him.

   I thought I wanted a familiar veterinarian to be with me and Roxy those last few seconds, but God said no, I'm sending you an angel instead. 

 I now have two beautiful golden doodle puppies and they have only seen Dr. Adam's and WILL ONLY be seeing him for as long as he'll have us. He is just so wonderful. He's straight forward and honest. The cost is extremely reasonable but the care is EXCEPTIONAL. You don't need to search any further that this man. He cares about the animals and is a true one of a kind. When you meet him, you'll just know. Your animal will thank you I promise.  God bless you all and God bless Dr. Adam's.",2021-01-17 06:17:53,774,3475,

As soon as we entered, we were greeted by a woman on staff (I think maybe the owner). She walked us through the menu, how to order, and the seating. We got in line to order but had to wait a couple minutes as the waitress was taking a lengthy to-go order. I didn't mind waiting at all but the staff made sure to apologize to me many times. I found it very professional and kind. 

Once we ordered, we received our fried deviled eggs (unique and delicious) within a couple of minutes and the 'loco fries' just a few short minutes after that. While chowing down on our apps the waitress came over and asked if we were missing an item. We told her we had also ordered a burger (Honestly we hadn't missed it yet as we were still busy eating the addicting french fries) and she immediately apologized. She explained that it got lost in the shuffle during the large to-go order she was taking before us. She said she would put the order right in and apologized again. It was evident that she thought it was all her fault, but who can keep up with to-go orders during a pandemic?! I feel like you need a masters to get everyone's food right. Anyway...We told her it was no big deal and we were happy to wait. 

While passing our table, one of the owners noticed we didn't have our burger as well. She stopped and asked us about it and was immediately off to see if she could help rectify the situation. About 30 seconds later we had our juicy cheeseburger and promptly devoured it. 

While finishing, the other owner came over and asked what he could do to make it right. We turned him down, saying it wasn't a big deal, and mistakes happen. He still insisted and kept offering us more fries or a beer. He clearly cared and wanted to make up for the situation. But what's funny is that it was barely a situation. Our burger was maybe a few minutes late and we still felt like we were the only customers in the store. 

What an incredible beginning to what I hope is a long and plentiful life of Sids Garage. We'll be back. Not only to try new burgers (PB&J burger anyone?!) but to get waited on by such impressive staff.",2021-01-12 02:53:40,487,2242,

Where I did deduct stars: 

1. the food was not good AT ALL 

2. pork chop, mashed potatoes, greens - pork chop was overcooked so it was tough & dry, the mashed potatoes were instant & watery, you expect instant mashed potatoes from fast food joints like KFC but not from a ""home cooking soul food"" restaurant & they had zero seasoning - no salt/pepper, greens were okay, had to add my own seasoning, asked for roll but got a dry cornbread muffin 

3. oxtails, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes - oxtails meat was okay but gravy was too salty & it was about 1/4 cup gravy spilled all over bag, watery instant mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes were okay but I've had way better elsewhere & at home 

4. peach cobbler - this is hands down the weirdest tasting peach cobbler I've ever had the misfortune of eating.  It was not sweet at all, I think someone forgot to add sugar, it was overly spiced with nutmeg/cinnamon or whatever they used, peaches were extremely overcooked so they were almost disintegrated, the dough was ?!, idk what was up with the dough, it was thin dark brown & so soggy, could not eat this 

What was inedible:
1. smothered pork chop
2. oxtails

What was good:
1. the roll on the oxtails dinner 

What was okay:
1. collard greens

Located in a small plaza along Meigs Road, Mesa Burger is the product of celebrity chef Cat Cora, businessman Chris Chiarappa, and the Mesa community as a whole. It's a casual eatery that borrows local jargon (Goodland, Funk Zone, Hope Ranch) and showcases some of the best gourmet burgers the Central Coast has to offer. You can say expectations are high, but they truly deliver on quality and it's always a satisfying meal!

The line usually goes out the door, but it goes by fast. Help yourself to any table inside or out, with great patio seating. 

On the menu you will find about a dozen burger options, some salad choices, and a boatload of customizations. The brioche bun they use is delicious, but you can switch to wheat/gluten-free. Beef patties are usually cooked medium, which is a tad dry for my taste. Upgrades include veggie patty, turkey patty, chicken, and locally-caught fish. The self-titled Mesa Burger is a solid choice and my go-to. For something more adventurous, Funk Zone is the one you want. 

They also have solid side items like sweet potato waffle fries, onion rings, and the parmesan herb & truffle fries I raved about earlier. Each come in single or share sizes, and they pair super well with your burger. One discontinued item they offered years ago was The Pit - a trayful of fries, ground beef patty, lettuce, salsa, and topped with cheese. Super sharable like nachos.

The girl at the window must have been stupid because she asked me multiple times what I ordered, and I told her every time why it was and that it was a mobile order on the app. About 5 minutes later she came back over again and asked what I ordered and asked me how I paid for it, cash or card. I said it was a mobile order I paid on the app. Then another employee came over and said it's over there on the counter.

So I did (mind you we have already been sitting at the window for a good 10 minutes.

  There was another car that was 2 cars behind me they had pull forward and they sat there for at least 10 minutes before they were brought their food.

The first time I walked in for take out, the girl at the counter and the delivery guy were extremely helpful recommending menu items.  It was so refreshing to hear their passion and excitement for their food offerings!  Their menu is pretty well rounded, several types of burgers, chicken sandwiches, pizza's etc.  It's an extensive menu.  The owner, who was manning the pizza oven, was nice enough to let me try a fresh garlic knot which was very tasty!  

I went with a cheesesteak the first time which was on a fresh Amoroso roll.  The sandwich came out quick and was one the of top 10 Delco cheesesteaks I have had.  Light grease/clean roll, nice cheese to meat ratio, sliced meat but not chopped too fine, meat was seasoned and had nice flavor.   The portion size was just right and the roll was definitely fresh.  I added some hot peppers for extra flavor and kick.  

Second order was delivery, we had a Sicilian pizza delivered to the office.  It was a solid offering.  Lightly sweet sauce, fresh cheese and just the right thickness.  I will have to try some of their other pizza offerings as well.  

Third order was a take out Cheeseburger.   The 8 oz of Angus beef could have used some seasoning, but the lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, hot peps, mustard and ketchup toppings helped relieve the lack of beef flavor.

Besides making good pizza and beer, it also serves at least 23 craft beers from around the country.  There is something for everyone here.  As for tap beers, you can choose from Lagers/Pilsners to ambers/browns/reds, sours, blondes/wheats, stouts/porters, IPAs, and extra strong specialty beers.

I walked in with a friend to try some unique beers.  I first had the Freak'NVanilla Hazelnut Coffee Brown (an American brown ale that is no longer brewed because the brewery has permanently closed and was bought out by Throne Brewing).  Perhaps that is why the beer tasted flat.  The second beer I had was a house beer, the Address Malt Witman, a Belgian witbier served in a 12-ounce tulip.  My friend had an Address Miguel, an American Porter and then a Lost Abbey Judgement Day Belgian Strong ale brewed in San Marcos, CA.  He liked them both.

I've been to this office for Physical Therapy with Dr. Brett twice now and have been really impressed with the level of genuine care and flexibility.

I injured my back recently and had a hard time finding in-network (CIGNA) PTs with positive reviews. This location only had 2 recommended reviews on Yelp (both positive) and another 25 not recommended (also positive) + Dr. Brett individually had 65 positive reviews on sharecare (link below), although this office is a 30 min drive from me, I tried it out and am so glad I did! Starting to see improvement already!

KEY TAKEAWAYS:

SERVICE- I was in a lot of pain and quite irritable on my first visit after a long drive and some logistical issues compounded by my natural skepticism of Medical care in FL. 
-The staff was warm and friendly, even putting a welcome sign in the area where I was to have my initial assessment, which was quite endearing. SEE PIC
-Dr. Brett was also incredibly calming and it wasn't long before I could tell that he knew what he was talking about and genuinely cared about assisting in getting me better. 

ONE STOP SHOP- A big plus is that there is an MD on staff (pain specialist) who can administer injections for pain, write referrals for MRIs and X-Rays. There is also a chiropractor on staff, all of which are in-network providers for my insurance. I will be seeing the MD next week, which was tacked on to a PT appt., so I don't have to make two trips.  

LOCALLY OWNED BUSINESS- Dr. Brett and his partner started this business 5 years ago with a small Clearwater location. Since then, the business has expanded to the current Clearwater location + this Seminole location.  From talking to Dr. Brett about the growth of the practice, his passion for the business and helping people was quite inspiring. 

OPTIONS AND FLEXIBILITY- 
-There are no cancelation fees for canceled appointments!  
-They also try to schedule visits with different providers back to back, to avoid multiple trips. 
-After work hours (until 7) M-Th.
-Patients can wait in car until time of appointment and can have private room for extra COVID precautions.
-There is another location in Clearwater.  

PARKING- Parking lot with ample spots is in the back of the building and walking from the office to the lot can be a little sketchy in the dark. 

OPEN CONCEPT- There is 1 large room that looks like it used to be 2 rooms with doors taken off the hinges used for PT, with a bike, table, and other equipment and may be shared by multiple patients.  There are 2 additionally closed rooms with doors and a 7 ft ish partition In the waiting room used as an additional treatment area. I wasn't really comfortable sharing my treatment area with others, so he was very accommodating and said I could have a private room for future visits.  SEE PICS

COVID- Everyone was wearing masks (although not sure if required) and I was told treatment areas are fully wiped down between patients. Can wait in car vs. waiting room if preferred. Office is clean and tidy. 

OTHER REVIEWS - 
-Currently, there are 25 additional reviews of this business that are ""not recommended"" (scroll to bottom of page to see these).

While the library is closed to foot traffic, you can still order books, kits, magazines on line. The online programs have proved invaluable to us.  We are caring for our granddaughters during the day and trying to provide preschool education to them. We discovered five programs that have helped tremendously and the girls participate every week. They get to hear new books that are relevant to the season. Most importantly, they get to learn from a variety of talented educators.

Preschool Pal is taught live via Zoom on Tuesday and generally has a themed program and several books are read to the kids. This class is nice because there is a little interaction between the librarians and attendees. The program generally lasts 30 minutes.
Stories with Miss Roben and Red is also on Tuesday and is via a you tube pre recorded program. My granddaughters will sometimes watch the short program multiple time.
On Wednesdays, they offer a facebook program, Virtual Stories with Miss Becky. Program usually covers three books and a couple songs.
On Thursdays, our girls love Moving with Mother Goose. This short program generally features a nursery rhyme along with creative.
And finally, Virtual Play and Learning with Miss Julie is a virtual prerecorded Youtube program, also reading a couple books and may include creative game/play activities. One of the activities we constructed a box maze to blow a cotton ball around. This simple game provided hours of fun.

Our granddaughters feel that they actually know the program leaders. The librarians do an outstanding job of connecting with the kids. Each is passionate about the program that they lead. The kids (and I) look forward to the programs throughout the week.

There are many other programs and learning opportunities at Hussey Mayfield. We also sign up for kits that the kids can work on over the holidays and the readying programs through out the year. Sign-up is easy on line. The library sends out a weekly newsletter with all the programs and links listed.",2021-01-23 18:46:12,396,2129,

I dined here in December 2020 when all indoor and outdoor dining was closed, so takeout was our only option.

I've been to this beach before, so I knew there were some picnic tables right next to the restaurant. I thought it'd be nice to get some brunch takeout and eat on the tables nearby.

My friend and I came on Saturday around 11:30, and there wasn't even a line. I guess most folks aren't interested in eating here without at least outdoor dining available. I've always wanted to try this brunch spot because of the fantastic location, so I was really excited.

I wanted to try their corned beef hash, as it's one of my favorite brunch dishes, and was quite disappointed to hear it wasn't available on the day I went. They may be operating on a more limited menu during covid, since some other items on the menu were crossed out as not available.

Instead, I went with the Boathouse Signature Breakfast ($17.95), which is essentially crab cakes with poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. I asked for the sauce to be provided on the side. It was pretty good, though having to eat it out of a takeout box did make it a bit harder to fully enjoy the meal.

My friend ordered the cioppino off their lunch menu ($22.95). I tried some and was not a fan. Having had some amazing cioppino in San Francisco, the version here was completely different and had a sweet ketchup taste more than the delicious garlicky seafood flavor I've come to associate with the dish. It did come with a lot of seafood though, so at least they didn't skimp on that.

One quick note about eating at the picnic tables nearby. It was incredibly windy on the day we went (I assume this is normal), so keep that in mind. Our napkins and empty bag kept getting blown away when we weren't paying attention.",2021-01-25 08:09:10,384,1830,

I bought over $9000 worth of appliances from Joe.  My credit card was charged in full for the items, but alas, it was pure HELL getting delivery of these items that were sitting in their delivery warehouse from the beginning of December 2020 to January 2021.

We had agreed that I would get delivery of the items as they came.  So Joe gave me 4 delivery dates spread throughout December 2020.

As each delivery was confirmed by phone by REI (their Allentown delivery branch), I confirmed the dates and made sure the entire day was free for these people to bring my appliances.

On each delivery morning I got a phone call from Allentown delivery saying that their truck broke down.  Then they would reschedule and the SAME EXCUSE OF THE TRUCK BREAKING DOWN WAS USED EACH TIME !  What's worse is that they documented in their notes that THE CLIENT RESCHEDULED and used that as the reason for not delivering.

When they did this for the 4th delivery scheduled, I told them I didn't believe they'd ever come.  They URGED ME TO ACCEPT A SUNDAY JANUARY 3rd 2021 delivery and I accepted and waited all Sunday from 7am in the morning.  No trucks came, and I called their delivery number and no one picked up because the recording said they were closed.

I called Joe at the King of Prussia Home Depot and informed him.  He reported it to a manager by the name of Nicole, who was supposed to call me.  Nicole never called back, not even on Tuesday the 5th.

I also got a phone call Monday 4th from Terry of the Allentown delivery department, apologizing for the truck not showing up on Sunday due to bad weather (which it was not bad weather that day !).  She tried to make me reschedule, but I told her I was sick  and tired of this and that I was going to let my Home Depot know about what they were doing.

Meanwhile, Terry informed Home Depot that the truck did come to my house on Sunday, and that I was not there !!!!!

I went to Home Depot on Tuesday 5th to schedule a delivery date ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT THEY SCHEDULED ME ON THE 7th and 8th of January without my knowledge!!!! They are also threatening to send my appliances back to GE ! And Home Depot is now accusing me of letting items sit in the warehouse for a month.  They also have chosen their own delivery dates without my approval on days when I will not be available.  I have wasted 5 ENTIRE DAYS ON DELIVERIES THAT NEVER CAME and now I am being told my items are being sent back if I don't accept those delivery dates.

I have NEVER EXPERIENCED SUCH DESPICABLE, SHADY BEHAVIOR from any company I've purchased from.

I would never go to HOME DEPOT again.",2021-01-05 23:55:46,554,2698,

I made reservations in advance, so our table was ready upon arrival. Our server was amazing--I wish I remembered his name :-( He was extremely curteous and knowledgeable of the menu. He offered great recommendations, that no one regretted. There was a chef special that night, that was a salmon dish. Our server explained the dish so exquisitely that pretty much everyone at the table decide to order it! I on the other hand wanted to treat myself to a hefty ribeye!! OMG!!! It's by far one of the best steaks I've ever had!! Literally. Typically, I order my steaks medium+ (very slightly above medium). I like a nice, light crust on the outside, but still pink on the inside. As I explained this to our server, he politely educated me that the correct term for that is called Pittsburg rare--I learned something new that night!!! Let me tell u....they cooked that steak to PERFECTION!!!!! To start, it was very robust (pics didn't really do it justice). It was perfectly, lightly charred on the outside but nicely pink on the inside. Literally when I cut into it, the juices just ran out and the flavor was perfectly classic--I was in love at that point!! With every  bite I took, that steak stole a piece of my heart! The JUMBO scallops on top, with a light drizzle of béarnaise was the golden ticket--a perfect pairing!! The scallops were also cooked to perfection--nicely browned on the outside but tender and juicy on the inside. 

We each ordered different side dishes that were very good as well and definitely generous with portion sizing! Collectively, I think we all favorite the Gruyere, Gouda and Garlic mashed potatoes, the Lobster Mac n Cheese and the Foraged Mushrooms--there were divine!! 

To round out the evening--I was brought a cute little cupcake and candle, for birthday wishes. And as we wrapped up our visit, the executive chef made his round to our table, to make sure we enjoyed our meal and elegantly requested feedback. This is indeed a nice & genuine compliment, for 5-star dining. The competition should take note! 

All-in-all, E3 by far, earned all 5 stars during our visit. I highly recommend for special occasions, date night or simply whenever you want a quality meal that you will not regret paying for!! I can't wait to go back!!! Well done  E3 Chophouse!!!!!!

P. S. The ambiance and atmosphere is always superb!",2021-01-11 18:37:57,550,2564,

You've probably read enough about the ordering system to have an opinion on it.  Yes, you typically have to order a week in advance.  Yes, they fill up quickly.  Hey, if you don't think you'll be hungry in a week then you aren't worried that the fill up.  Besides, if they didn't fill up quickly, that is probably a sign you might not want to order from them.

Ordering system aside, they make some good pizza.  Not the best I've ever had and not the best I've ever had in the city.  Probably the best I've had in Manayunk.

There Grandma style is a heavy crust and is covered with sesame seeds. Its also a square(ish) cut. If you don't like sesame seeds, you should past. While it comes in at their priciest pizza, it does fill you. This is the pizza to get for a big meal or party.  I do wish the side pieces ended up with more sauce as they come off a bit dry (while the middle pieces are usually totally covered in sauce). 

Their round looks, feels, and tastes like your standard pizza.  We enjoyed it margherita style and felt the cheese and sauce balance was on point.  The crust is a bit thinner, but it is not a thin crust pizza by far.

The only thing I can comment on the service at this point is that they will have your order ready on time.  They seem like a nice staff and I am excited to order in one day in the future.",2021-01-21 15:55:44,307,1354,

A few months ago I dropped my car off for an oil change and tire rotation and although I had a morning appointment, they kept my car all day and over night.   I wasn't a happy trooper.

My most recent visit was due to an engine light staying on.   I made an appointment on-line, and because of COVID, I didn't want to sit there and wait.    Many of the workers sporadically wear masks, and I don't want to subject myself to that.   We dropped our car off the night before using the drop off box.   My appointment was for 9:30 am.    At 12:30 I hadn't heard anything so I called Craig, my service person and he said there were 2 cars in front of me?    WHAT?   I had a 9:30 appointment, how could I still have cars in front of me after 3 hours?   Why wasn't my car worked on at 9:30, which appointment was made based on other things I had going on that day?   He texted me at 2:30 to state that there were still 2 cars in front of me.    What's going on?   I called him.   He said it's like a doctor's office and that you wait until he can see you.    If I had been sitting there waiting since 9:30 my blood pressure would have been through the roof.   I asked to speak to the service manager.   He did call me after a little while and stated that they take care of people that wait for their cars, and not based on appointment times.   WHAT?????    Who ever heard of such a thing?    This reminds me of a Seinfeld episode at a car rental agency.   They can take appointments but don't keep them.    I told them we needed the car back and that if they couldn't fix it by our picking it up at 4:30, then they shouldn't repair it.    We arrived at exactly 4:27 and the car was done.   7 hours to replace a sensor, which the service manager told me is a quick fix.   

We own two 2016 Rogues and I can't even fathom replacing them with another Nissan based on this poor service department.",2021-01-27 13:58:52,431,1988,

We arrived about 50 minutes later and he said they still hadn't started making the food yet and to wait in our car for another 20-25 mins for our food. The guy was not very nice about it and didn't apologize or say anything to make up for it. We went to our car and waited 25 mins and he finally brought it out and I asked him if this is how it normally works (waiting an extra 25 minutes when you arrive) as it was our first time there. He walked away while he responded and shrugged his shoulders saying everyone showed up at once. There were only about 2 people picking up food while we waited. We were very nice the whole time but he wasn't. Even after we had ordered $80 worth of food!! Once we finally drove 20 mins back home with the food we had to reheat a lot of it. The wonton soup was really bland. The pad Thai was basic, nothing great. The volcano chicken and amazing eggplant were good but definitely not worth $16 each!! The Thai vegan Rangoons weren't out of this world like everyone says. Probably won't go back again especially after the way he treated us and set terrible customer expectations and then didn't make up for them when we arrived. If he had apologized or been nice at all it might have made up for it. I don't recommend unless you wanna deal with the poor customer service, long wait times, and basic Thai food. We are also vegans so we were thrilled to try this place but we'll have better luck at other Thai places that aren't fully vegetarian/vegan friendly.",2021-01-17 01:50:53,341,1608,

Our server Dylan was constantly making mistakes throughout the whole evening and also hardly ever checked up on us. First off Dylan forgot to put in an order for one of our guests, so when all of the food came out hers didn't since he ""forgot"". Also I ordered a margarita and it took 25 minutes for it to get to the table. Keep in mind it wasn't busy at all and the bar was empty as well. I'm not the type to complain but my family and I love this restaurant and frequent it often. We all felt as if Dylan was under the influence because he seemed so dazed and kept forgetting to put things in and was basically non existent, he was in the back most of the time no where to be seen. At the end of our disappointing dinner we had to wait almost a half an hour to receive the check, we were looking around for Dylan and yet again he was no where to be found. Also there were about 4 servers huddled up by the side gossiping about co workers and were all on there phones on the clock. At this point my table and I were furious that we had such crappy service and were having to wait for so long to get the check. So I got up and asked the bartender to get a manager. Once the manger came over, I believe her name was Amy. She mentioned she was the new GM of this location. We shared our experience with her and she apologized but to be honest my table and I felt like she could care less her apology was so robotic and not genuine. Like I said before my family and I eat her often and have never had an issue until tonight. The previous manager was always walking around and making sure the place was performing at the highest quality and that the service was on point. Now it just seems like the staff can stand around on the phones or hide in the back. the service was very upsetting to us and even more so that the manager didn't even seem to genuinely care.",2021-01-11 16:29:19,414,1949,

Its prices, although on the higher side, are well worth the food's portions, flavors, and creativity put into making them. And the servers are incredibly kind and accommodating. 

I love fish tacos, so I got those, but (although they were super tasty) I should've gone with my gut and gotten the Tuna Melt that my friend ordered. It had just the right amount of crunch, melt, moisture, and ZING of flavor. Too good!! The ceviche and shrimp were fresh and flavorful, and presented oh-so-beautifully. 

The only reason I put 4 stars is because of the wait... we were told we would wait an hour. Which was already stretching it, but it was understandable given the sheer amount of people waiting to eat at this place. We went for a walk on the beach, but when the hour had passed, there were still no tables to be sat at. An hour and a half into the wait, I decided to go up to the front and ask for the tables they hadn't assigned to anyone (since they were in direct sunlight). We were immediately seated! We all got a bit rosy/burnt (depending on our melanin levels) from sitting in the sun our entire meal, but at least it was away from the crowd and we got to eat!

Within 2 hours of her being home she busted her sutures open and her tail was bleeding everywhere. At this time it was after 9 pm so Petsmart was closed and Walmart does not sell those cones. So I had to take her to Fetch emergency center to have her tail sutured back up and had to pay over $200 for that when I just paid over $300 to do this surgery! A cone should have been included in that and sent home with her. This is 100% negligence on their part for not providing that and I should not be responsible for this ER bill! I tried multiple times to contact the dr to tell her my concerns and demand I get reimbursed for that ER bill and she does not have the decency to return my call.

We've recently relocated to the area so we're attempting to try all of the local restaurants.  Since DF had a good selection of steak and fish on their menu, we thought we'd give them a try.  We were somewhat surprised to find the restaurant only moderately occupied, but it was a late Saturday afternoon, so hopefully this small crowd would result in a more attentive service.  

The wife was going for her standard, filet mignon, but I was looking forward to the Halibut as it was standard on their menu (not a special).  When I asked our server about the fish preparation options as the menu specifically says to ask the server, she had to go ask someone as ""she was new"".  In fact, every question we had about the menu, she had to go ask someone, which was frustrating.  Unfortunately, my question regarding fish preparation resulted in being told that DF had no Halibut, and in fact, no fish at all.  With this, I gave up and also ordered the filet mignon with sides of mashed potatoes and broccoli.  

Overall, the food was good, not great, but DF is only slightly less expensive than Ruth's Chris.  However, our dining experience at DF was far from Ruth's Chris level of service and quality.  I normally compare my restaurant rating with my wife's as I can sometime be more critical of the small things.  However, as soon as we walked out the door at DF my wife made it clear that ""we won't be going back there again"", which accurately summarizes my perspective as well.",2021-01-26 22:35:38,328,1572,

It was held at a facility in Nampa. So they were selling tickets for it. HOWEVEREEE they held a giveaway and that giveaway was 2 tickets to the event, some other fun ish and 2 ticket thingys to Roxberry for two 24oz shakes. Aside from winning the event tickets, I was so stoked to get these two tickets because I had always heard about Roxberry. If you live in Boise, you know the traffic is absolute....shiiiiiiiiit! If it's not in the vicinity of my house/gym, I do whatever I can to NOT go hahaha! I'm an old man. However, shortly after moving to Boise, I developed this ""I'm not going unless it's hella early, after 6pm, or close to the house""
The traffic was just named in the top 10 of the worst in the country! Beating out Boston, Philly, and other major cities. It's soooo congested! I hate it. It's SERIOUSLY time for me to move to Wallace. Anyone know of any jobs up that way, holla at me! I'll do whatever! 
Just wanna move up there, to a homey little house, have some dogs and live a simple life, 
If you've seen my pics of it, you'll know what I'm talking about! 
There I am, getting off topic... AGAIN!

So Roxberry! Located in Eagle, Idaho and also one in Nampa. When I went to the Pound event in October, that was my 2nd time to Nampa in over 8 years lol! The traffic to there....OOOOOH LAWDY! 
So I head to l to the Eagle one. Google maps tried to take me through Chinden & Eagle Rd. That entire intersection is ripped to shreds and will be for like 2 years. I don't even have to say what I'm thinking because I'm assuming you already know lol.
So I went the back way. Linder Rd, passed by the Merdian Temple. Traffic wasn't bad at all. Took 21 mins. Drive home tho...9 mins haha! 
I walk in and right away said ""why does it smell like a really great sun shop in here? Like not Subway smells, but better!""
My friend, Jade said the same thing, staff all agreed. It was a good yet awkward 10 second greeting lol.

The staff was sooooo nice! I love going to shake places like this and getting anything peach BUT...I won't eat an actual peach! Figure that one out, because I'm still trying and all I can come up with is....I am a....mess lol.
So she's like ""we have peachy keen but it has bananas"" obviously I was like...no problem! We are supposed to have a banana whenever we can, right? I usually put them in my protein shakes. 
My friend Jade ordered some weird peanut butter shake. IIIIIICK! That just didn't make sense to me hahaha! 
We sit there and catch up for an hour and a half. Been a couple months since we last saw each other. 
So we chat chit and chat chit and chat chit. I tell her about my Florida trip and how unbelievably horrible it was hahahaha! 
She tells me about her short stint at a nanny job in Malibu where life was pretty incredible for her for the short time she was there. Ya know, chat chit lol.
We leave. I get home and text ""so did you like your shake?"" Because I'm thinking...mine tasted like ass. 
She's like ""omg yeah, I loved it! Thanks so much for thinking of me"" and I was like, ""well, originally this was for Tiffany, but I haven't seen you since November"" hahaha I'm such a dick lol. She laughed and said it was sweet I took her.
Then says ""why? What'd you think of yours?""
I'm like...well! Didn't she say it was called ""peachy keen"" and she's like yeah lol. I said they REALLY need to call it ""banana-y keen"" because I ain't taste NAAAAN peach in that and told her I was happy it was free hahaha! 

So me being excited to go there kinda came to a screeching halt after the first sip lol. 
I don't mean to bitch, but fr! If it's ""peachy keen"" make sure we can taste the peaches lol. Maybe they ran out or something hahaha!

Aside from the thing they're known for lol, the place was a cool little spot, 
Some pizza place is next door & my fat ass was like..:we should have gone there. SOOO! Next week we are SUPPOSEDLY going lol. I say that because we always make plans and they pan out 4-6months later hahaha! 
She's one of my closest friends tho so it's all good.

At least the company was good, right? 

Ok this was an EXTRA rambling, extra off-topic review haha! My apologies for that!

There old comps were off the hook. They made ever blue collar Joe feel like a king. They even gave you VIP parking. The place was FAR from fancy but they treated you well. Now they have new ownership and these people have their heads up their asses. 

They took out the bubble craps machine, they got rid of their blackjack machine so he place is basically a slot house that you can find at any Indian casino. They raised all the minimums on their black Jack tables to $15 a hand from $5 a hand. They raised the minimum on the craps and the roulette too.

I've stayed everywhere from penthouse suites at the Bellagio to... well, the Sands in Reno so I've been around. I've gambled all over Vegas for over thirty years. I can't understand why in our year of COVID these idiots decide to squeeze out the locals and regulars?

On top of all that the staff is rude and hate their jobs. If you smoke then they tell you to pull up your mask between each puff. And not politely! They are down right rude. And constantly they will remind you to the point you are so fed up you just want to walk around the corner and play at a bar that treats you
Like a human being. What really pissed me off was a ""supervisor"" told me to pull up my mask between puffs the when she did the inventory she pulled down hers and I was only four feet away from her. 

They have no decent food options except Mels diner that makes a good burger but a dry club sandwich. It's impossible for me to describe how this place has really tanked. It was never fancy. Honestly it was a dump but they had fun games and the staff treated you good. Those days are gone. ANYWHERE IN RENO IS BETTER THAN THE SANDS.

I said that it was already in effect and that it did not because it was not a federal law but a state law.. he rolled his eyes at me like I was stupid and said at least one of us passed history class. I stated that I was pretty sure marijuana was legalized for those over 21 under state law. And he said ""be careful out there genius"" like I was really stupid for believing that. Two things, one- who the hell is that rude to a complete stranger much less a customer?2- he was completely wrong, and for a smoke shop to be spreading disinformation like that is completely counter-productive borderline dangerous. I don't know if he was messing with me because I forgot to call it a proposition but whatever was up his butt that day was no reason to take it out on a repeat customer. I've dealt with other employees bad attitudes at this shop in the past but this was the final straw I will never go back and I've talked to several other people that feel the same way. The prices or above average and with the amount of smoke shops in the area I have absolutely no reason to return or recommend this establishment.",2021-01-27 18:06:15,319,1555,

Today is my BF's birthday and he loves Datz. So...Datz it was for breakfast. 

One us tends to order either the Shrimp and Grits and/or Waffles and Tweets and we share. But today I was in the mood for some eggs. I created my own scramble and went with breakfast sausage, spinach, tomatoes, and goat cheese paired with breakfast potatoes. It was DELISH. I will be adding it to my list of options for sure. The amount of cheese was perfect and the sausage wasn't too salty or greasy. The eggs were cooked just right as I like mine to be a little well done and the potatoes were perfect, not too soft and not too crispy. Datz always does right. 

My BF went with the Waffles and Tweets aka Chicken and Waffles (not the benedict one) with a side of cheese grits. Their grits are BOMB. We have ordered them to go many of times before going home to make breakfast at the house because I don't prepare my grits like they do and doesn't seem like any other place does either! Try them! His waffles and tweets were satisfying per usual only this time he had a little bit to take to go.

Datz has A LOT to choose from on their menu. If you happen to not want breakfast, below are some items to try, but either way...you can't go wrong! 

Meatloaf
Pork shank 
Salem Hayek Salad

Normally, it is metered, but on Sunday, was free parking!

We entered near the bar and were greeted!  Can you  believe it?  A pub/bar that actually welcomes its guests!  After asking if we were eating in or getting it to go, we were directed to the main dining area, but told that if we didn't find anything suitable, we could sit in the other dining area on the west side of the bar.  They normally don't have that area open, but because of the games on the multiple tv's, they had a large crowd.  Fortunately, our server/bartender was high energy and made sure he hustled to get our order  in and our beverages (and tableware) brought out promptly.  Excellent attention which I appreciate someone who realizes that taking care of the customers is important.
 
Anyway, we ordered the full size fish and chips and asked them to split it which they did.  We each got cole slaw (house made and quite tasty).  He brought out the malt vinegar, but since the tartar sauce was so delicious, I never even tried the malt.  The fish was delightfully breaded and seasoned.  Little bits of crispness, but no oily taste to the breading.  The fish was fork tender and fresh.  Bright white in color so it looked just as appealing as it tasted.  Note the waiter brought out steak knives, but we simply didn't need them.

I looked through the lengthy list of beverages, but since I had tried most of the local options, I went with a Breckinridge  NItro Raspberry Porter.  Maybe not the perfect choice for fish, but a pleasant tasting beverage for sipping while waiting.  

I haven't been here during the evening, but I highly recommend stopping in for lunch!

There is a parking garage connected to the building and a patient drop-off area in front of the building. Take your ticket with you as you pay inside the garage door by the elevators.

I've been here several times and the Information Desk is always extremely helpful. They can tell you which floor and color area you're going too, if needed. I found knowing the color of the area I needed very helpful.

This trip I was going to the  Neurology Department to see Dr. Adam Comer for a procedure. The check-in desk was easy to find and the staff was friendly and efficient. I had to wait longer than usual but the doctor had a procedure which took longer than expected. The waiting area is large and the entire building is peaceful plus filled with natural light from the full wall of windows in the front of the building.

Dr. Comer had two interns with him for my procedure. It was a teaching moment for them with Dr. Comer supervisoring. The procedure took about 45 minutes and Dr. Comer explained his findings at the end of the procedure. He was attentive, professional, had a good bed side manner and provided instructions well.

If you find yourself hungry or need a beverage check out Sonny's. Sonny's Bistro & Pizza is just passed the main elevators on the 1st floor. They have terrific sandwiches and pizza and open till 2:00 p.m.

I ordered take out on a Friday night and heard straight through the phone how busy it was! I figured this would make the dishes even more fresh because the kitchen won't stop moving! They told me to come in 30 min, when everything would be ready! I ended up waiting an extra 20-30 minutes due to the mixups below.

Let me start off by saying how friendly and kind all the staff was! However, I think they were a little too busy because I got the wrong meal twice. Luckily I knew my order, so I was helping them out by letting them know on the spot. The manager ended up checking to see if everything was alright and saw I had the wrong item and let me keep it as an apology for all the mixup! I thought that was sweet and unnecessary, but so happy I kept it because it was the best dish we had that night! Below is each item's review: 

Salad (forgot to take a picture)- the salad that came with the meal was delicious and filling!!
It had beets, chickpeas, tomatos and crisp iceberg lettuce with a nice and tangy Italian salad dressing! 5/5

Bread roll with garlic herb butter- the herb butter was delicious but the rolls weren't that great...they weren't warm and tasted like a cheap roll. 3/5

Arancini- it was super crisp and had a very soft yet thick texture inside. The risotto was nice and thick and the ground beef chunks added nice flavour and chew. I think it may have been too thick. If the inside was a little bit creamier, it would have made this perfect! The marinara sauce went nicely with it! 4/5

Chicken Rollatini- this was the free dish we received from the manager because we didn't originally order it! On my own, I would never have ordered it! Free, however, was a great way for me to try it! I'm so happy I did because it was a nice crisp chicken that was lightly  breaded and the mushroom marsala sauce was an awesome pairing! 5/5

Grandmas Sunday feast- I had ordered this dish because it sounded amazing! However, I was left unimpressed with it. I found the rigatoni was overcooked and tasting like Barilla pasta I boiled at home. The marinara sauce was too acidic and the sausage inside was tender but nothing great. The meatball and short rib were the highlights of that dish. The meatball tasted like it had truffle in it or it was pan fried in truffle oil. Whatever it was, that was delicious! The short rib was nice and tender and easily pulled apart with a fork. 2/5

Butternut Squash Ravioli- this tasted like fresh pasta! Worlds better than the rigatoni and grandma Sunday feast! The pasta was al dente and the the butternut squash filling was slightly sweet and paired beautifully with the cream and truffle oil. The zucchini in the center was nicely seasoned!

Foggetaboutit Pie- this pie has a lot going on in it! It's a peanut butter cream pie with an Oreo base, and dried banana slices throughout with a bunch of different chocolate chunks blended in as well as chocolate toffee pieces dusted on top! Caramel and chocolate drizzle was on it with a dollop of whipped cream! It sounds like a recipe of amazingness but it was insanely sweet for our own good. You were left dehydrated by how sweet it was. And we had a small sliver of what we received! It was a gorgeous presentation though. 3/5

NY Cheesecake with Berry compote- the cheesecake was an awesome texture with just the right amount of tartness and an amazingly light and fluffy texture! It definitely tastes like it was slow cooked in a Bain Marie to get this kind of texture! The Berry compute was lovely and the graham cracker crust was nice and thin- just how I love a cheesecake crust! 5/5",2021-01-24 06:41:07,752,3725,

Atmosphere: the decor is stuck in the 80s with drop ceilings, carpeted floors, dated upholstery and decor. It is in need of a facelift 

Service: very attentive. They are very generous with the biscuits so beware if your bread plate is empty you will end up with another biscuit. We were served by at least 5 people from the waiter, water guy, bread guy, and food runner and bus boy 

Crab salad: generous on the crab but it could have used so additional acid to freshen up the seafood and a bit of salt to enhance the crab flavor 

Crispy Snapper breast: omg this was so good. I didn't care as much for the sweet/sour flavor but the fish itself was perfectly cooked and crispy. A must order 

Pork belly: I thought it was ok. It's not worth repeating in my opinion. The pork was dry and it didn't have enough fat. Basically too much pork and not enough belly 

Whole mangrove snapper: again another perfectly executed fish dish. The snapper was very lightly breaded and crispy. We also didn't care for the rather sweet glaze but it was very easy to ignore given the really well cooked fish. 

Dirty rice: very rich. There must be lots of butter or some cheese in it. Tasty but doesn't need to be repeated 

Chocolate bomb: my husband enjoyed this. I didn't taste it so can't comment too much on it 

Pear sorbet: ok I was super full but I had to try the pear sorbet bc I don't see it offer as a dessert item. I was not disappointed at all and glad I got it. It's the perfect palette cleanser to close out a great seafood meal",2021-01-11 05:26:59,353,1667,
3hFKnT8IbRZ7rLZaMl0-kw,-kLVfaJytOJY2-QdQoCcNQ,WbcLJqj84WrGRZ1FWQeQeA,2,12,4,9,"I finally figured out a decent drink through much trial and error.

The only reason I continue to come back to Dunkin is because of their $2 specials (most recently $2 medium lattes) or flat our free drinks (free iced coffee Wednesday just ended). However, a lot of the time I throw away most of the drink or think, well this would be extremely upsetting if it wasn't free. 

Here is everything I've learned so far on my Dunkin adventure.

Get flavor swirls, they are so much better than sweetener, which makes the drink too sweet, or flavor shots, which don't add any sweetness at all. But if you get a flavor swirl, do not get the pumpkin spice. I made the mistake thinking this would be like Starbucks pumpkin spice. It's not, it's disgusting. It has the aftertaste of a fireball shot. This was one of the drinks I threw away.

I had a free drink to redeem so I got the Large Iced Macchiato with a caramel flavor shot and oat milk. Normally that will come out to $5, which is one of the most expensive drinks on the menu. At that price, I'd rather go to Starbucks. (I mean, I should be going to locally owned and operated, but I'm mainly using drive thrus right now during COVID). But I do admit that this drink was delicious. 

When you see a long line at the drive thru, remember that this isn't Starbucks. You will sit in line for quite a while, it is not fun. I've learned to order ahead and if I see a long line at the drive thru to just park and grab my drink. Usually it's empty inside. 

The only reason I'm not giving this place one star is I will be back for their $2 or free drink deals. I just learned it might take a while to get to a drink that I can tolerate.",2021-01-04 21:21:32,380,1677,

I've tried many sushi places near my home and even traveled 30 minutes away to find more average quality sushi.  Don't get me wrong I do like to go to the AYCE sushi joints and definitely have some favorites but again, what you get is average quality food with a surprise here and there.

I noticed a glowing review for a new restaurant named Jing's sushi house and decided to give them a shot on New Year's Eve.  I decided to play it relatively safe and order some basic maki rolls, and a sushi and sashimi lunch special.  I used their online ordering option on their website and it was very simple to enter my order and schedule a pickup time.  Note that Jing's is only offering takeout due to Covid.

I received a call an hour before my pickup time to confirm my order and scheduled time.  When I arrived, I was greeted by friendly folks whom I am certain were smiling under their masks.  They handed me my order and offered me a free bubble tea...any flavor.  I chose mango.  It was delicious.

When I arrived home I opened up the giant cake box my order was handed to me in.  At first look I knew we were in for a treat.  The fish color was just perfect.  The rice on the rolls was not overloaded like many of the local places do.  The sashimi was bright and cut so thick each piece looked like it could have been cut into 3 or 4.

I placed the order on a platter and my family and I indulged.  It was absolutely delicious.  Every piece loaded with flavor and melted in my mouth.  Alas I have found a somewhat local place that has that big city sushi quality I missed so much.  And on top of all that the prices are insanely reasonable.  I mean where else do you get any 2 high quality maki rolls for a $7.25 lunch special?  They also offer brown rice for an additional $1 (another option I haven't seen locally)

I'll be back soon to try some of their other offerings and special rolls.",2021-01-05 03:28:00,421,1995,

Well it's a must!!! 

I gave 4 stars instead of 5 only because I was told an estimated wait time and it was triple that (they weren't busy and I went early!) I also paid extra for extra salmon and I was given the standard portion :(. The chef wasn't present today. The staff that I saw weren't wearing masks and were just a tad bit les then friendly. 

So aside from that, the food is amazing!!

I've been here a few times (pre-yelper), but this is my first review. 

I had the grilled trap panini and trap chowder. This was the delay for my order. They make them to order (awesome) but it took like 30 mins for a fancy grilled cheese. Anywho, it was delicious! It's so flavorful. The bread taste like OG trap buttah ...the insides overflow with gooey cheese and trap goodness...just delicious! The trap chowder is so freaking good! Like gimmie a gallon and a straw and I'm good for awhile. The chowder is filled with crab, shrimp, corn, potatoes and I'm guess Chef Oya ""put her foot in it""...lol. It's my favorite item on the menu. There aren't words to describe its gimmie as...just be sure to get it when you visit. 

I ordered the salmon tray for a friend. I've had this before and it's good. I love the veggies and OG garlic buttah sauce w/ parm and spicy seasoning is the way to go! Other sauces are offered but I love this one so mention I'm scared to try a new one!",2021-01-23 03:13:10,328,1406,
7knnkggoqpetQ3JOJf34Eg,aOigOHBMSaPtVwk-2NnwDw,RGTX7OL9zgfvZCwWd_vZwQ,1,0,0,0,"I recently had an unsettlingly poor experience with this location.  After years of relying on Discount Tire, I'm never returning. 

I was visiting Tucson from Phoenix last week for a 2 day hiking trip when I suffered an inconvenient flat tire. I arrived at this location at a busy time, but that's understandable and not the substance of my complaint.  After waiting for about 20 minutes in a line outside, one of your representatives spoke with me.  I explained what had happened and noted that I needed to get back to Phoenix the following day.  I expressed our hope that your staff would be able to fix the tire if possible, and that if it were not fixable, I'd need to replace it so I could get home (my vehicle had only a compact spare, which wouldn't last the 100+ miles back to Phoenix). 

The staff member was somewhat rude (which should have been the first clue that this wouldn't be a normal Discount Tire experience), but I shrugged it off as a byproduct of the growing line and the pressure he was under to address everyone's needs quickly.  When he informed me I was facing a 3.5 hour wait, I asked whether that meant the work would not be completed that evening (it was 3PM local time, and the door said the location closed at 6PM).  He reassured me that the staff would not leave until the work was finished, and that one way or another, I'd have a safe vehicle later that evening. Scrapping my plan to visit the national park for an afternoon hike, I Ubered back to the hotel and waited by the phone. 

Sure enough, a little over 3 hours later, at approximately 6:15, my phone rang.  The Discount Tire representative on the other end impatiently asked, ""so, are you coming to pick up the vehicle? We're closed.  I can either pull it in for the night or lock the keys inside.""  When I asked whether the tire was repaired, he had no clue what I was talking about, and put me on hold to speak with another staffer.  He came back on and said no, the tire wasn't salvageable, so the compact spare was on it and I needed to come pick it up.  

I relayed to him the information I'd given when I checked in the vehicle and noted that I had not received another call (along with the 3.5-hour estimated wait time, which had not yet fully elapsed).  He huffed and once again went to check with the other staffer and came back to assure me that they'd called me multiple times before closing and the calls went straight to my voicemail, so there was nothing they could do and that he could lock the keys in the vehicle for me. 

I received no prior calls.  I went so far as to check with Verizon, and they showed no register of the calls made to my number.  I don't know whether the story about the missed calls was an outright lie, or whether they'd dialed the wrong number.  And if the calls had gone to voicemail, it seems reasonable to then leave a voicemail, which he did not describe doing. 

At this point, I explained that the only key I had was the one that I'd left with the store.  Locking the keys in the vehicle would create an even bigger hassle.  And, with a sizeable chunk of the 48-hour trip ruined already, I didn't want to be carless until the branch re-opened in the morning.  Whether through Discount or not, I needed to get an operable tire installed that night.  Ultimately, rather than wait the 20 minutes necessary for me to uber back to the store, or spend the time necessary to make an additional sale and replace the tire, your employee locked my vehicle and left the keys under the car in the parking lot.  

By the time I got to the car, your competitors and the other Discount locations around town were closed for the night.  I ended up having to rely on a questionable 24/7 used tire dealer on the outskirts of town, who sold me a no-name, patched full-size tire to get back to Phoenix.  

Now that my vehicle has a mismatched and unreliable tire, I'm going to replace all four tires in the next few days.  As a matter of principle, I will be doing so through a competitor, rather than through Discount.",2021-01-04 17:44:08,845,4040,

We had seen anejo trying to open for over a year now and we're all anxiously awaiting our first time. We also saw all of these tik toks on how fun and wonderful it looked! Boy we're we all so disappointed. 

I am going to start with the positives. For $67 it is 4 dips, guac, unlimited chips, coconut French toast to share, bottomless of choices of sangria, margarita, mimosas, & bloody Maria that you can interchange & one entree. I loved the idea of it almost being 3 courses, and to be able to switch up your drink. There is 90 minutes for you to have to leave your table. They do wrap their plates & silverware which is awesome. However, they do have a thermometer but none of us were tested so not sure if that's just there for show. 

Multiple of us work in this industry and we always like to give the benefit of the doubt, but we all just left disappointed. It started by having a reservation and not being seated for 15 minutes after, however, according to our waiter our bottomless started at the start of our original reservation. Did we want to sit outside? Yes. Was it cold and we're we prepare? Yes. However, the minor heaters they have to help that are underwhelming. It was also sad to watch the table behind us who weren't abiding by rules of 4 people per table get put into the heated tents in the back because of breaking of the rules. 

It started with getting dirty glasses, we kindly got them cleaned and again that happens. But then to have to ask THREE different people and times for more chips it just continued to disappoint. As you can see in the picture, there's not a lot or chips for a lot of dip. Our food was all ""ehh..."" the brunch menu only has a few things. There are multiple servers, but we were forgotten about many many times. We kept having to go find someone to get refills, on anything.

It is my understanding that this was built in the 1920's. However, that should not be excuse to lack of attention of the upkeep of the rooms. Our room was spacious upon entry, but very motel like. The couch is most certainly NOT vintage and they need an upgrade. There were many stains on it, and I feel like I need to take a shower after sitting on it. The bathroom was decent. Nothing felt overly clean. The tile needs to be redone because it is so old that it looks like no amount of regular cleaning will do the trick. There are many stains and it gives you an icky feeling. The sink was not properly cleaned. There was soap scum on it. When it came to the bed room, the sheets were clean which was definitely a plus. One of our drapes had a huge hole in it which is easily fixable. The door to the bathroom looked like someone kicked it in and the hinges need to ve replaced. These are also something that can easily be fixed.

But the carpets in the hallways are DISGUSTING and OLD! 

Once again, the staff is VERY friendly and helped make up in areas that were lacking. 

The location is PERFECT. I would say this is the type of hotel you stay in if all you are doing is sleeping but it still feels very dingy. I would not stay here again. 

The price relates the location and NOT the quality of the hotel and amenities. 

Another thing for the owners to take note of. When having rules that apply to Covid, you should take an ALL or NOTHING approach. 

We were staying for 3 days, but they said the do not change bed sheets unless you were staying longer than that. Covid does not magically go away after Covid. 

The sheets got dirty and needed to be changed. I am on vacation and changing them myself is not something I want to be doing. 

Therefore, do not change the bedsheets AT ALL if you are truly worried about Covid. 

Rules are fine but not rules that lack common sense and if someone is paying money to support your business then they should not have to sleep on dirty bedsheets.",2021-01-01 22:16:55,457,2186,

Several of the cashiers are elderly and while i think its great to employ them maybe find another place for them to work besides checkout.  A few weeks ago I went to this location and was next in line with several hundred dollars worth of groceries on the conveyor belt ready to be checked out.  The cashier Kathleen was taking absolutely forever chatting with the customer in front of me that she was checking out while my groceries sat melting.  When it finally seemed it would end this customer pulled out some kind of a personal check and wanted it cashed partially and applied to her balance partially and added to another account.  I'm sorry I didn't realize I was at a bank.  It seemed clear that this was some kind of a scam which this particular cashier was not smart enough to figure out.  Of course she made several mistakes during this transaction causing me to have to wait for over 40 minutes next in line.  Finally a manager came and informed everyone in line it would be several more minutes to straighten out never once offering to open another register to accommodate alerting customers or apologizing for the delay.  Finally I had enough and informed them I would be leaving and they could put the groceries away that had by then been sitting for close to an hour.  The incompetent manager whose name I did not get proceeded to chase me out the door berating me for being impatient.

The burlesque dancer was doing her thang when we arrived around 12! They offer a two course brunch and a bottomless hooch or Bellini option. I took advantage of both and did the bottomless Bellini, crab claws (for the crab lovers!! Don't pass them up!!) and the Bananas Foster. I had seen photos of the sweet potato beignets on Yelp so I asked the waiter about them and the Chef came out and offered to make some up for us since they weren't on the menu and I must say they were deliciously savory and sweet!! They ended up having duck in them and we didn't know so the chef apologized (even though it was my fault I requested them not knowing they had meat in them) and offered a free glass hooch!

The second time I went up to the bar, I was confirming what the name of the game was, only to have security come up saying he's asked me to leave when that's that was my first encounter with him in the first place. I was super confused because he wasn't giving me a reason besides telling me he's asked me to leave before? Not a problem. There are plenty of casinos in the area and I didn't have my heart set on playing. 
Decided to stop by Mels to buy a milkshake only to have him yelling ""EXCUSE ME EXCUSE ME. YOU NEED TO LEAVE.""
You're the only one making a scene here, sir. You're embarrassing yourself. I stayed to order the milkshake ‍ Must've felt really strong and important telling all of his security buddies that he's secured the place by making me leave 
Of course he walked away when I started recording him. If you're in the right, why are you so ashamed to be recorded? Your face is covered up with a mask as well so unless you're worried that your supervisor'll notice you, no one else would.
This has never happened the few other times I've gone with my friends who all happen to be white. Seeing how he couldn't give me a reason, it does make me wonder if he thought he was securing the place from Asian people. Have never seen another Asian person in that building so that says plenty.",2021-01-08 20:28:20,355,1617,
v2RUcbMlb6eEXRqG3A3Cnw,GcdYgbaF75vj7RO6EZhPOQ,bwh7ozWD_qk6Ebzvac4eQA,3,7,1,3,"Many moons ago, there used to be an Eagle Diner in Woolwich Twp. I'm not sure if this one's related, but I do know that it popped up in a Yelp search for turkey salad and I used to love the one made in Woolwich. With that in mind, a trip to Pine Hill was made.

Eagle Diner looks like a shiny classic diner from the exterior. Inside, it's warm, slightly dated (with some pretty deep gashes in the booths), and feels exactly how you'd think of a diner.

Our server was friendly and prompt. I ordered a Caesar salad and a side of pork roll in addition to my turkey salad club, joking that I was ravenous from having not eaten all day (this was around 3:30 pm). She came right back with the salad, which was very much appreciated. And it was delicious! The best bits of romaine along with tasty croutons and a delectable dressing. I ate every bite.

I was surprised to see that the turkey salad is made of sliced deli meat turkey rather than the real deal. It definitely did the dish a huge disservice. I've never had deli meat submerged in mayo before like that. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't the most appealing either. I wouldn't go out of my way for it again. The side of pork roll was the thick kind and was more greasy than charred. Also just not my thing.

My mom ordered the French toast with bacon. She loved the French toast but wasn't a fan of the bacon -- she said it needed to be crispier, and just by looking at it, I'd agree.

We were given free pie slices for dessert - lemon meringue and cherry. Apparently sometimes they just give out free dessert, which is nice of them.

If I returned to Eagle, I'd probably opt for breakfast.",2021-01-04 02:33:02,364,1645,

Tonight on a whim I walked to La Boca. Was craving a steak specifically a Ribeye. Saw they had it on the menu and went. I was seated and received prompt service. Ordered my meal with a great wine suggestion. Enjoyed my wine while waiting for my entree I noticed the great attention to detail to maintain COVID protocols for the restaurant. They notified each guest asking to keep mask on when approached at the table as well as when they got up to go throughout the restaurant. Also when guests left the staffs would put on new gloves to remove the plates and drinks from the table. This extra measure of security didn't go unnoticed and I was so thankful for it.
The steak! Was top 5 best steaks I've ever had and I've been to a lot of steakhouses in different states and places. The seasoning and cook was so spot on (med-rare as it should be) I didn't need their 3 sauces they provided but I loved the option of having different bites. The fries were so crispy and well seasoned.
I was there solo celebrating by myself because of an event that occurred and an ongoing guest there paid for my tab. So you can imagine.. me bailing my eyes out at the pure kindness of a stranger. The restaurant even brought me a dessert drink to help celebrate.
I was so in Awh by this experience I don't know what can top it. It was a random Thursday with only me.. and two other tables. I'm so thankful for this experience and I will forever cherish and remember it. 
10:10000 will be back again and will make sure everyone knows how amazing this steakhouse truly is.",2021-01-22 02:19:08,326,1570,
gw8pWU2w8NBkhJ_Z3fkBtQ,qAFFt22rHqtbyuTlnOWO3w,xsumpGkMjvbULFeoDEvmEg,2,3,0,0,"Based on the impressive reviews here on Yelp we had higher hopes for this restaurant.  I think if we had tried it without ever reading any reviews we wouldn't have been as disappointed.

First - the place is really comfortable, clean and attractive.  The hostess did something that many don't - she asked if we'd prefer a booth or a table!  Kudos!

Service wise we felt that there were 2 small problems.  Our server was average and she made us feel a little pushed.  It was later in the evening when we arrived and it's not like they were turning tables.  I'll get to the 2nd issue later...

The food.  We ordered a side of meatballs and the octopus appetizer.  The meatballs were somewhat bland - as if it was nothing more than finely ground beef with their tomato sauce.  I wouldn't get them again.  The octopus - very pleasant.  But - the gold standard of Octopus is Paul's in Tarpon Springs.  We may have received a whopping 2 tentacles compared to Paul's that provides a full octopus for the same price.  The octopus was tender and flavorful - just underwhelming.

The rolls - they look delicious in the pictures here.  They were average at best.  Kind of dry.  There's a place less than a half mile from Espositos who have garlic knots that are excellent - SliceMasters Pizza.  They're not rolls.  But they're MUCH BETTER.

The salad was delightful.  Fresh, plenty of salad for 2, nice dressing and nice presentation.

Wifey ordered the chicken piccata.  Ho hum...  Meh...  Thank goodness they included a lemon on the side to squeeze.  Made it much better.  Want the gold standard in Tampa for piccata?  Iavarone's on Humphrey Street.  Wow!  I'd say they have the gold standard for meatballs as well.  VERY flavorful and tender, and awesome ""gravy.""

I got the eggplant parm.  Pretty good.  Not awesome or incredible.  Since I don't go to a lot of Italian restaurants in the Bay Area, I can't tell you where the gold standard is.  I will tell you that I had eggplant about 2 years ago at a little pizzeria in St. Pete about 2 years ago and it was better than Espositos.

My eggplant came with a side of spaghetti.  One look at the bottom of the bowl and it had at least one-quarter inch of water.  There's nothing I dislike more than pasta that's not well drained.  ZERO STARS here!  I drained the water onto my bread plate and gave it to our server, which I believe ties into my final note...

Throughout our meal, we observed the manager checking in with each table.  ""How's your meal, do you need another drink?"" etc...  Hmmmm...  he never checked in with us.  We had to wonder if it was because of the obviously drained water on the bread plate?

Normally I might give this experience 3 stars, but because we were ignored by the manager, they lose a star.  It takes some bullocks to step up to a table where there may have been a problem.  We wouldn't have complained.  And the next paragraph says that we'll do what most people do who feel slighted or are underwhelmed with their food, their service and their experience...

We won't complain and it's very likely we won't return.  Lesson to business owners and managers - you no longer own your brand.  We the public own it as we place our ""silent vote"" on social media sites such as this one.  And your brand:  It's yours to please or disappoint the people who truly do own your brand.",2021-01-18 00:13:36,701,3348,

I had been going for 3 weeks to my family provider who is affiliated with St Luke's and they were unable to treat a very severe ear infection. The staff was nice and all and they had me get a CT scan to see if the infection was deeper. The PA I had gave me some run around about a clogged ear and that's all it was. I eventually ended up going to an ENT who I had to see 3 times a week for a month for aggressive treatment on this issue. When I go in the ENT he double checks it the left side we are looking and and I said no. He tells me the CT scan had been done on the WRONG SIDE. I call St Luke's telling them I'm fine paying for the visit but I am not happy paying for something that was done incorrectly. They tell me they will look into it and get back to me. Today they posted the bill back onto my account in full with some letter saying sorry but we are right you are wrong. They have a horrible billing system and give sub par care and it took DAYS to get through to anyone on the phone to even discuss the issue. I will never go back to them ever again unless I have absolutely no choice. Horrible customer service they only care about your money for the least possible amount of work they can do. DO NOT GO HERE FOR ANY REASON EVER. GO ANYWHERE ELSE.,2021-01-02 20:10:24,308,1374,

I've tried the Tough Cookies & Berry Rebellious filled cones (the latter someone shared). These ice-cream desserts are MEGGA LARGE! I especially liked the warm brownie cookie bites named ""Chocolate Bubble Bites"" -- talk about a chocolate lover's dream come true. The $10.75 Bubble Waffles are enough for three people to share. If you get them to go, they'll come deconstructed in a brown cardboard box. (The other available Bubble Waffles are Goin' Bananas & Gimme S'more-- both chocolate & vanilla waffle cones are available.)

Also available are eight Waffle Pops from $6 to $7.50. Flavors include Sweet & Nutty; Tropical; Crunch Berry; Candy Bar; Chocolate Crush; Salty Pig; Crispy Cocoa; and Bombin' Almond. All ice-cream served here is Blue Bell-- Chocolate, Vanilla, Strawberry, and Cookies & Cream. 

Eight beverages are sold here-- frappe; iced coffee; lemonade; hot chocolate; cafe mocha; expresso; cappuccino; & Americano. 

If you're not feeling the dairy, there are 15 gourmet popcorns on the menu! Taste testing is an option. What flavors? Butter Me Up @ $2.99 and 5 favors @ $6.99 (Sriracha Cheddar; Tough Cookies; Gimme S'More; Hollapeno Cheddar; & Red Velvet). For $5.99, patrons can choose from In A Pickle?; Salt & Vinegar; Boujic Barbeque; Honey I'm Home w/ Mustard; Cake My Day; Mmmm Kettle Corn; Kay So Queso; and Sweet & Cheesy Blend. I sampled the Tough Cookie variety; if you want a sweet popcorn, it's a good choice; however, I didn't find it excellent.

Catering is available; use the online form. There's an Awful Waffle Awards Program-- earn 1 point for every dollar spent. Redeem the points for a free Bubble Waffle. Another Awful Waffle will soon be opening on the lower floor of International Plaza (or may already be open). 

I have one recommendation for the business owner AND/OR patrons of these sweet treats: Someone should provide a CLEANSING WIPE with every waffle. The dessert can be very messy. On my first visit, I managed to get a lot on my fingers, light pink sweatshirt, & tan pants! I wasn't a pretty sight:)

The desserts are too large for me & I like to avoid sugar, but I'll return if I get an itch to try another flavored popcorn. And should Awful Waffle management ever decide to add smaller Bubble Waffles, I'll be happy to return to eat them:)",2021-01-23 15:40:08,550,2576,

The first time I went a few months ago I got the tofu double mushroom, which was pretty, pretty good, but I guess I had expected something spicier, so I decided to hold off on a review until I had one of the spicy dishes (which is, after all, what they're most notable for). My partner DID have a spicy dish that first time, the chili szechuan tofu, and he really enjoyed it. 
Well, this time I decided to try their mapo tofu. Mapo tofu used to be one of my favorite Chinese entrees when I was living in New York, but I hadn't bothered to try it in the nearly 3 years I've been in Philadelphia, until yesterday. I am so glad I waited, because this mapo tofu was a REVELATION. It was definitely spicy, though not tear-inducingly so (fortunately). It tasted exactly the way I imagined a really great recipe I'd found (but never made) years ago would have - the oil in which the buttery soft cubes of tofu nestled fairly sang with the flavors of spicy broad bean, garlic, sesame oil and of course, the essential szechuan pepper. Seriously, this is the best mapo tofu I've ever had. 
My partner went with his standby favorite, vegetable lo mein, and he described it as (one of) the best he'd ever had too. It included pieces of sauteed tofu, which one doesn't usually get in this particular dish.
Great prices for ample portions, and very quick and accommodating service (takeout during a pandemic, and both times I forgot to ask them not to pack utensils on the phone, but they quickly removed them from the bags each time I requested it when I went for pickup). I might not ever bother ordering anything different with mapo tofu this good.",2021-01-10 02:38:42,380,1771,

From the moment we entered the restaurant (group of 6) for lunch, we all got an uneasy feeling. There were three staff all with a major case of RBF who did not look pleased that we were there... in a time where restaurants have been struggling, you would think they would be happy and accommodating. They started us out inside, splitting our group up to two different tables. We moved outside though so we could be a little closer together. I was underwhelmed with the friendliness of our waiter also. It took forever to get water, utensils, and menus. You know, the basics. We ordered tea with some appetizers and the water was clearly from the tap and was lukewarm at best. Many of the utensils, glasses and dishes were dirty, with smudges, lipstick, and crustiness on them. We mentioned that the utensils were dirty, and a waiter just handed us a new set, without saying sorry or even taking the dirty set away. We asked for them to turn on the outside heater next to our table, and they said they would, but after 20 minutes later they still hadn't, so I asked a different staff member and she finally turned it on. The food was decent. I had the Portobello & Black Bean burger which was pretty good, but others in my group had the Lobster Mac & Cheese and Prime Rib dip, which both missed badly.. some didn't even finish their food. After the crappy experience we had, we were ready to pay and leave. We noticed on the bill that they automatically included an 18% tip to our bill, which explains why they didn't feel the need to be nice. All in all, I felt the customer service was worse than the post office before the holidays. No greeting like ""hi welcome in!"", or even a ""thanks for stopping in, we appreciate your business."" I even walked passed our waiter on the way out and said thank you and he didn't even look at me. The only reason they get 2/5 stars is because their food was decent. Would never go back.

What did your trusted Kia source say about the panel of the roof that was lifted from the air dryer?

***

I have a 2012 Kia Sorento. Great Shape. Until it went through Tommy's wind tunnel of hell.  It tore off the top of the roof where the panel sealed near the sun roof. I had a bug shield for the hood of my car that was pulverized by the vortex wind dryer at the end of the experience.  I could not recommend this place any less.  I've driven up and down I-75 for 8 years in this car with no issues..no accidents...no storm or speed ever ripped off my bug shield like this thing. I've been through many of car washes without an issue.   One day at Tommy's for 19.95 wash now costs me 80.00 for a new bug shield and permanent destruction of my roof.

When I noticed what had happened, we turned back into Tommy's and spoke to Darwin, the Manager. He said he would need to review the video to see and confirm where in the carwash the damage occurred. He would need to get his admin to approve any repairs or compensation as it was ""above of my pay grade to make the decision"".

We also have the entire incident on video.

This is what happened when we reached out to contact them after my horrible experience:

Good afternoon sir,
As stated on our disclaimer posted at the entrance of the wash, we are not responsible for any aftermarket parts. After contacting a certified Kia dealership we have confirmed it is an aftermarket part. Therefore we can not repair or replace the bug shield.
   Thank you,
Darwin Warriner

It is no longer any of those. My father was quoted a price to open and close in November, for our mother who was just put on hospice, by an employee over the phone. When our mother past in December, we went to pay and were told the cost was close to double the original amount. The only explanation was that the internment was occurring on a Saturday so that was an additional cost and that the cost does go up every few months. This was only one month and the difference of nearly one thousand dollars? First off-if your giving one direct price for this service why is it just one price and no advisement on the up charge for Saturday's. It doesn't end there. While in the process of signing and paying they tried to sell my father on prepaying for his opening and closing. Wouldn't you think that  there would be some compassion in realizing he just lost his wife? Who wants a sales pitch at that time?  It's not like they don't have his information and couldn't  reach out compassionately in the months ahead to  approach that subject. It's all about the almighty dollar with this company.

The good: we stayed in room 229. Where do I start...CLEAN! Whenever I check into a hotel the first thing I do before I even unpack or put my things away is check the sheets and under the bed for bed bugs and stains. This hotel passed that test. The shower was HUGE and therapeutic. The room was the right size for me and my husband. It wasn't too big &  wasn't too small. They also gave us 2 free drink coupons to redeem at the bar. I wish I knew the bartenders name but the young lady made me a vodka lemonade that will forever go down as the best I've ever had. It was simple with all fresh ingredients but it was delicious! And I loved that there was a chicken place directly across the street from the hotel that stayed open late. It's called we dats. 

The bad: front desk staff that we encountered was not customer service oriented. We weren't greeted with a smile until we were checking out. When we checked in the young lady seemed more interested in getting back to her conversation with her coworker. Also, what we didn't know was that they charge a $75 ""hold"" for ""incidentals"". When inquiring about the return of that fee I was informed that it was returned. I would recommend using a card you never use with only the amount of the hotel and the fee so that the transactions don't get lost and mixed up. Speaking of incidentals our side table was chipped and I called the front desk to inform them of this so that I would get my $75 back.

While I have been back on several occasions since I wrote it, the key takeaway in this review is that my only regret is not having gone more often!

As I've covered many of the standards and highlights before, I'll use this review to serve more as my recommendations:

Start w/the Tsamthuk soup.  Get the Ting Mo and dip to your delight!

If you are there with friends, get the Momo Combo and share.  Steamed or fried comes down to preference. I love having a few options, however, if asked to choose just one style, I would actually recommend the veggie momo.  Please keep in mind I consider myself a meat-a-tarian!

Don't ask me about entrees because I'll just recommend them all.  Seriously, I have yet to find one I haven't loved.  The Tibetan Style Curry is great in all its forms and they even have a (currently) off menu veggie option that made me reconsider my opinion of tofu.  I'd say the Phaktsee is my favorite, then I'd remember the tastes of the Shatrak or the balance in the Beef Bok Choy and refer you to how I started the paragraph (don't ask me about entrees).

Be warned, the Beef Salad is spicy (imo).  Like numb the front of your mouth spicy.  It ended up pairing well with the Tsamthuk.

If you have room, it is worth treating yourself to the House Special Dessert. Just like all their other dishes, it is authentically made.

Comparing an order from here to any other chicken fingers and fries order anywhere else this place wins hands down 10 outta 10 times.  A couple of drawback though but it's about time this area filled the void of a Nashville or spicy hot chicken place.

Chicken - both the tender and the sandwich are a 10 out of 10.  Three different flavors for the chicken original, Nashville or inferno and all are amazingly. My original order the tenders were saucy but this time it seemed like more of a dry rub or spicy powered.  So flavorful, tender and crisp bit of course expect and embrace the greasiness.  

Fries - in my local Facebook group someone commented how the fries looked uncooked; both times I ordered they didn't seem to be a fresh batch of recently dropped fries in the friar.  That's the main reason for missing a star; also my most recent batch of fries was mostly crumbs not actually fries.  These are waffle fries similar to chick-fil-a so they break apart easily if not cared for or it could have just been the end of the bag of fries.  They also have an option for their homemade seasoning on the fries which i recommend

Fixings - my first shot there wasn't any Texas toast   But they threw in a couple extra tender; this time I got the toast which was butter and good
As for the cole slaw even though it is mentioned as included on door dash for the tenders baskets I didn't get it either time.  Maybe it's a misprint but it was on the sandwich which was good

Sauces - sauces are Stella; very original; their house blend is a creamy zestyish sauce, the others come down to preference but are all good

First, they have the strictest mask and contact rules of any restaurant I've been to in the last 10 months.  This is both printed on the menus and explained as we were being escorted to the table.  If your server approaches, you're required to mask, even if there's food/drink at your table.  Contactless ordering (fill out a sheet like a sushi restaurant) and contactless payment (they bring the credit card reader to you and you do it all).  They have a single beverage and food drop to minimize interruption/contact.  We were very impressed. 

We ordered a bottle of Argentinean wine, a Cab Franc, and two cocktails to start the celebration.  Their cocktail and wine lists aren't extensive, but enough to find a nice pairing.  

We both ordered the family tasting menu, which came with a sampling of their appetizers (Empanadas Criollas, Chorizo, Bruschetta, and Ñoqui) and we ordered the Sweetbreads as well.  The sweetbreads were 100% worth adding - the best I've ever had, ever.  Apparently we were eating grilled pancreas - I would've thought it was an exotic white fish.  (Seriously, I'd go back JUST for this.)  Then, with the tasting menu came the Heart of Palm salad (yummmmmmm) and the steaks with two sides (fries and a bowl of squash/kale goodness).  My husband got the 20 ounce Ancho (ribeye) and I got the 8 ounce Bife de Lomo (filet).  They were cooked perfectly and seasoned exactly right.  This place does steak like you've never had it, and it was awesome. They also provided their three sauces which I can't remember the names of, but they were tasty on the fries! 

The meal ended with our chocolate flowerless cake and a candle for my husbands birthday.  

We boxed up soooooo much of our food, and had it for breakfast the next day. 

The restaurant itself is spacious (and even more so with the reduced tables) and very quiet.  It's decorated with dark woods and has the traditional ""steakhouse"" vibe.  Big, beautiful round bar in the middle.  Our server (Sybil, I believe) really added a nice aspect to our evening, giving us space, protecting us (and herself) from Covid, and providing some guidance along the way.  

We will be back, no doubt.",2021-01-12 00:40:33,487,2353,

Where to start...happy with the two packers they sent to pick up and pack, Chris and Brian. They were careful and appeared to wrap and pack truck carefully but from here on out it was ridiculous. The move was for my 86 year old Mother who I finally convinced to move closer to us in NC. They tried to change delivery date but as we were bothe still in florida we were unable to be in NC when they wanted to deliver. We scheduled another date closer to the original agreed upon date to help them out with scheduling but then the communication stopped and no delivery came...we wasted and entire day and half of the next waiting for movers in an empty house unsure of when they would show up...no communication...then they call to say they would deliver that night...10PM??? We are two older women...we are not meeting folks we do not know at an empty house in the middle of the night. When they finally showed up the next day after noon and lifted the door to the back it looked like a train wreck. Needless to say lots of damage to furniture, scratches and rub marks and several antique pieces were destroyed. Legs broken off of desks and dressers. A leaf of a table split in half. The mattresses werent wrapped. Some of the furniture looked to have been unwrapped and repacked several times inside the truck. They packed someone's lawn mower inside the truck with gas in it and so my Mother's upolstered wing back chairs and sofa smelled of gasoline. They lost a marble top off a side table. None of the items were tagged or inventoried in Florida and when I asked Chris about that he assured me that they had a system that would ensure that my things were kept together and not lost. He in fact thought that my load would remain on that truck as packed to go to NC. It obviously didnt and he misspoke. The care that was taken to our possessions once they left our sight in Florida was horrible. I watched them push and shove and incorrectly unload in NC. They were untrained and unable to do the job. The communication after pick up through till now is horrible. No call backs, no claim forms...it is quite evident that the management doesnt give a damn. Oh yeah and Justin and Frank both told me that they only hire Veterans which was a determining factor in our decision to use this company. This turned out to not be true either. I have pictures of some of the damage...it was heart breaking for my Mother.",2021-01-08 15:51:37,505,2465,

I reached out via email inquiring about a 2021 CRV. The online sales rep contacted me with a great price. We then spoke over the phone and I asked for an out the door quote but he would not give this to me (he said that he's not the guy who runs the numbers...). I made an appointment to visit the dealership for a test drive. Even though I have been emailing, texting, and spoke with this sales rep for almost an entire week, and made an appointment to see him, when I got there he had no idea who I was. The test drive went well but then when it came to the numbers he came back with a sheet of paper with the cost and fees and with one hand covering the final price and with the other hand pointed to the area of the page that gave the different monthly payments depending on what my down payment would be. I asked him to remove his hand so I could see the final price which was $10,000 more than the original price quote via email. In addition to various fees, some expected and others not expected, the car on this sales contract was the wrong car I was interested in. My email was specifically regarding a 2021 and it turns out that I had just test driven and was given a quote for a 2020. When I questioned him on this he said ""oh no, Honda hasn't come out with the 2021 models yet"". I said I wasn't interested and then they said we can lower the price if you trade in your old car. I said I wasn't interested in trading in. They then said we'll give you a good deal. So I let them see my car (which was a mistake). Then he came back with a low ball number. I then said no I'm not interested and the sales rep wouldn't take no for an answer. He then got his manager and I had to say no to him. This manager then came back with an individual who identified himself as ""working for Honda and not for this dealership"" and whose job is to ""help customers get the car they want"". Again I had to tell this man that I wasn't interested and finally they let me leave once I mentioned that I was feeling pressured. 

Buying a car is a horrible experience and these guys made it worse. Consider buying a used car from carvana or carmax where there is a flat cost and no negotiation.",2021-01-11 17:08:18,493,2247,

So, we paid for the mattress on Monday (12/28) and the mattress was to be delivered (Friday) 1/8/21. 
We called at 10:08am on 1/8 to verify what time the delivery is planned. The older woman told us that we will be getting a call ""this morning"" to notify us what time our delivery is scheduled. 
By 2pm, we had not received a call. 
We called at 2pm and the ""manager"" said that he was told 48hrs earlier (Wednesday) that our mattress would not arrive and he even said ""I was supposed to call you""... he never did. 
He dropped the ball completely. 
He kept asking who we spoke with, as if it even matters, I told him we spoke with an older lady & told him I thought she was the owner, as he kept asking over & over again, who I spoke with. 
There doesn't seem to be a lot of ppl that work there, so I would think he could figure out the actual person I spoke to, since he was insistent on knowing who I spoke with. 
That alone rubbed me the wrong way, as it implied that I was lying. Who gives a sh$& who I spoke with. 
The fact that he knew our bed never arrived and he was told to call us three days ago to let us know & he never did, it falls on him. 
He has zero business being a manager, as he obviously can't manage himself out of a paper bag. He alone lost a sale of over $1,000.

1 -- Sales service is decent as are plans, especially now that they have no contract options.

2 -- Customer service after the sale is dismal to non-existent.

3 -- FiOs internet speeds not as advertised.  They throttle down at random times of day and night, sometimes to the point where even Gmail won't load.

4 -- Wifi coverage is spotty and intermittent.  Some days it's good in a particular spot, and other days non-existent.

5 -- Billing is atrocious.  God bless you if you need a change to your service.  Examples:  

a) Unbundled my triple bundle, in error, and billed me three times what I owed.  I had to pay the bill anyway in order to protect my credit.  They took over 9 months to get this straight and said  the only ""fix"" was to cancel my original contract and start over again with the full 24 months.

b) Didn't actually fix the unbundling error correctly.  Never closed down the two extra accounts their error created.  Reported us as charge offs to the credit bureaus when we'd actually paid them more and earlier than required.
AND the item was reported anonymously.  Our banker and mortgage lender said they'd never seen that before.

c) Because of the incorrect information Verizon reported anonymously, our home refinancing application was held up until the issue was fixed.  Rates increased by 1%, costing us extra each month for the life of our mortgage.

d) They gave us wrong information about what equipment to return when closing an account.  We sent what they asked for, and they billed us for other items they previously said did not need to be returned such as an obosolete router we were told to throw in the trash.

e)  We provided a receipt for returned equipment, produced a chat screenshot documenting what we were told about trashing the router, showed them the bill -- none of it matters.  If their rep didn't update Verizon ""notes"" for your account, it's like it never happened.

f) As of 01/13/21, I am personally aware of 4 situations where accounts were closed and equipment returned, yet several months down the road, Verizon is still sending out bills for ""missing"" equipment.  Seems they want you to give up in frustration and pay them AGAIN for a router which was rented years ago and returned months ago.  Best to buy your own.

g) A friend just canceled his Verizon FiOs account.  The closed account shows up online, but it also indicates he made a payment on 12/31/20 when none was due until 01/15/21, has a credit balance of $90, yet is also a past due in the amount of $122 -- all on the SAME screen page.    

h)  A payment was made by mistake and then canceled (customer error).  The payment is marked ""canceled"" in the website payment history.  Verizon sent an email about the payment being RETURNED by the bank with potential fees being charged by both Verizon and the bank.  Seems they treated the canceled payment as NSF, resubmitting it again a few days after the cancellation.  Funds are tied up as we wait to see what will happen.

i) Customer service hours have been trimmed by about 50% since COVID.  Verizon's lengthy holds can take up hours of the work day,

j) The examples listed above involve multiple customers and errors extending across 10 years.  They are not anomalies or triggered by  COVID 19.  Is Verizon FiOs -- not Verizon Wireless -- some sort of liars' club or clown show or both?  Where are you, FCC?",2021-01-13 18:23:31,710,3482,

Unnecessary testing, additional costs, my dog was sick I brought him in,  bloodwork is reasonable. Then the Chest X-rays that can't be read at the office, the antibiotics by iv at the office, and more tests were to much, ok but I did them. My bill over $700, I paid but it was a lot more then I expected to pay.. I explained to tech I was not happy and wanted to speak to doctor. The shaming began. Tried to embarrass me about me questioning why payment was so high. This is valid question. 
They tried to embarrass me in front of other people why I wouldn't pay this for my dogs care. I said I did pay but it was a lot and a little more communication would have been favorable. Then they gave dog antibiotics and sent him home but asked him to come back next day for more iv antibiotics treatment. I said how much will that cost? And they said only another $100. But you should bring the dog to an animal hospital this weekend but it will run you a few thousand dollars. I said let's see how the antibiotics do before going that route. Tech not happy, said those shaming words again, we do not know what your financial situation is, while in front of several other patients. When my dog was done with the 2nd day treatment of the antibiotics he was so lively It was very obvious he felt better. I took him home and we finished the medication course and he was better. In total I spent $900 that time, shamed financially 5 times and now will never return with any of my dogs. Did I mention they missed some vaccines like lepto and my dogs had their regular visits.

I came into the restaurant in the late afternoon on a whim because I was given a gift card for my birthday and happened to be in the mall on this particular day. The establishment itself looked great, and the staff was friendly as well. It wasn't particularly busy, so I placed an order for an entree and a piece of cake for takeout. The girl behind the counter told me it would be about a 15 minute wait and asked for my phone number so that I could get a text confirmation when the order was complete. 15 minutes passed by and my name still hadn't been called--no problem. I was in the restaurant business for most of my life so I gave them the benefit of the doubt. 30 minutes pass by, and by now a few people that appeared to have ordered after me received their food first. Again, I was not bothered; perhaps my meal just took longer to complete. During this time, it had not gotten excessively busier than it was when I first arrived. I saw the manger and the hostesses talking up front when they weren't preparing orders or running food in their downtime, but still, I had not received my food. 45+ minutes pass by now, and I decide to ask one of the managers about the status of my order. By this time several people had come and gone with their meals. She went to the back and returned with my food which, by the looks of it, had obviously been done for some time. She handed me the bag with a ""sorry,"" and I left. I never received a text confirmation and nobody ever called my name. My food was cold by the time I got home, and I only live 7 minutes down the street. Needless to say I was disappointed to have to use my microwave for a $38 meal. I was really hoping this new location would be better than the one in the international plaza, but I suppose that's not the case. I find it strange that for such a high price you receive such low value. But then again, how much more can we really expect from a restaurant in a mall?",2021-01-01 04:00:53,439,2020,

I had a coupon for a FREE ""little John sandwich"" as long as I used the coupon on the app. My husband and I have never had JJ before but WE LOVVVVE SUBS, so we were excited to try it out.
We downloaded the app, they got all our informations, like phone numbers, location, email, blah blah blah all the things to try to sell us more food. Hey, our souls are totally worth a free sandwich so whatever ‍.

We order thru the app, no problems at all.
My husband is an EMT and works weird hours so he wanted his two sandwiches to be his lunches to take to work for tonight and tomorrow. 
Since we eat subs a lot, he knew that the sauces/condiments don't hold the sandwich well over a day. It makes them soggy. So for tonight's sandwich, he ordered light mayo and mayo on the side and no mustard but mustard on the side. He did this so when he ate it tonight it wouldn't be soggy and he could add the packets. This was within the scope of the app- the app allowed him to do all that. For tomorrow's sandwich he ordered no mayo and no mustard on the sandwich but ordered mayo and mustard on the side.
Again, we do this a lot and ppl mess it up a lot- which is no big deal, not the end of the world. We never expect perfection.

I go to pick up my husbands to sandwiches. There were two men working. One with shoulder length black hair and the other with no hair(probably mod). I told them my pick up orders. They gave them to me. Although we asked for extra pickles, I knew it wouldn't be enough for my husband so I asked for more. The black hair guy said ""no problem"" and kindly wrapped some up for me. Then I looked in the bag for tomorrow and there were no mayo or mustard packets. The sandwich for tonight had one mayo and one mustard packet. Okay, no problem, I just asked for more. The black-Haird kid said ""no problem"" and went to get me the rest of my order. The bald guy stopped him and said ""the owner doesn't want us giving out any more packets"" ....uhmmmm what? Lol. 
I said ""oh, I thought I ordered them"" and then went to look at the receipt bc I've made mistakes before.  

he said ""if you would have gotten them on your sandwich I could have done it but I can't give out extra packets.""

....okay but if this is a cost thing then what's the difference? I got 0 on the sandwich but some on the side?

Also, one sandwich you gave me the packets when I said packets on the side and the other said the exact same thing but you didn't? What's the difference between sandwich one and two?

Look, I'm a nice lady and I'm not about to argue over some spicy mustard. I mean, I got a free sandwich, I can pay for some mustard.

I said ""okay, I'll just buy the extra sauce then""

He said: ""You can't"" 

Bro, why are you trying to hold my mayo hostage?! I'll pay the price dude, whatever you want is yours!

He could totally tell I was taken back.

""No, like I'll pay money for them, how much are they?"" 

He replied, ""yah, there's no way in the system I can charge you for them.""

THIS IS GETTING WEIRDER AND WEIRDER. 

Like, do I need a secret clearance letter? Is there a password?

sauce = not on sandwich 
Sauce= on side instead 
On side  sauce
Sauce = money
Money= my pocket
""Nope, you can't have it and you can't buy it.""
BRO BUT IT WAS ON MY ORDER AND ITS NOT IN MY BAG. Now I want to pay for it and you're still telling me no?

I very very kind and calmly said, ""okay, I want one mayo packet and one mustard packet- how do I do that?""

I think this logic broke my poor friend, he said ""fine just give it to her but if the owner comes in...""

I said ""he should have my number. My names Nicole, tell him to call me""
Jk I didn't say that but that would have been funny.

Turns out, we got one slice of salami one slice of capicola and even tho the guy said ""if you would have gotten it on the sand which, I would have given to you you"" I did NOT get light on the sand which I did get it and DID NOT get extra pickles.

It's very evident the ""owner"" scares his employees and does fake advertisements in hopes to get ppl in the door or get information.

We won't be going to any JJ again due to this owner.

I already sensed the person's tone of voice quite with an attitude but assumed she was probably in a bad mood so just ignored it and kept asking questions. Like I said---- it was my first time ordering from the place. I had to hang up to look at the menu quick and said I will call back in like 5 to 10 mins before 7:30pm which was their last call to place an order and after saying so, no acknowledgement or whatsoever, not even an ""okay"" from her and she just hang up on me. That alone gave a very bad impression!

I went ahead, call back and still decided to place an order to satisfy my sushi craving and not let anything ruin my appetite. I was expecting the attitude will be different the next time I call but boy was I wrong!!! The manner and tone of voice sounded irritated and straight up rude! I could not help but ask why was she giving the customer that kind of attitude then she tried to flip it around and acussed me as the one giving an attitude instead!

I cancelled the order and just hang up and gave the same kind of attitude she gave me the first time I called. I asked my husband to call back the place and look for the manager because I can't take another encounter with a rude person. My husband called, look for the manger and to our surprise, the manager and the person I spoke with are the same and she named herself Grace.

THE UNPROFESSIONALISM OF THIS PERSON WAS
UNBELIEVABLE considering the fact she is the manager!

I haven't tried their food yet that looks good in the picture so I can't say anything about it but with that kind of service this business will lose customers, for sure!

I saw the larger groups dining outside, while the smaller groups able to dine in. The lack of tables and open space inside combined with the dimmed lights gave a feel of privateness for a nice date. The server was nice, and showed just enough attention not to be too interactive for our dining experience. Sanitizer was available on each table. We came in at 9:30 on a Sunday morning and were able to walk right in, but after we left there was a long line. At the time we walked in, all dining outside spots were packed. We wanted to order the Eggs Benedict dish over a toasted baguette slice with hollandaise sauce smothered over, but that dish was no longer available to order (I forgot the dish's name). Instead, we got petite steak and beef brisket huervos ranchero. The petite steak had a mix of tender steak slices mixed with potato hashes and peppers. The potato hash were just the right mini bite size (even a dainty biter won't feel the need to break it into pieces) with a nice crunch and seasoning. I'm not a fan of potato hash, but even I ate quite a bit. Covered over the mix were two glosseming sunny side up eggs and a hefty amount of the restaurant's special sauce. Fruits are served as well to change up the taste as the dish can be a bit heavy for one person. There were also two toasted baguette slices perfect for soaking up the sauce. The portion size feels like 1.5 persons if that makes sense heh. I had one bite of the beef brisket huervos ranchero. The quesadilla like feel from that slice was nice, as the slight crunch with the delicious brisket and slight tangy sauce on top worked well. If you like quesadillas filled with brisket instead of cheese, this is perfect. I agree the portion size would be able to serve for two people; especially with load of potato hash located in the center underneath the two sunny side up eggs.

I ordered, the Burrata ($5.95), the Spaghetti Vincenzo (Shrimp cappers in a cognac pink sauce for $14.95), the Ravioli of the Day ($16.95) today it was the saffron with ricotta, then both desserts Cannoli ($2.45) and the Tiramisu $4.95. We were going to get the lasagna to go, to cook the following night, but they didn't have it available that day.

When I got to the restaurant, they have the tables spaces around the edges of the walls, and there were two tables taken. The restaurant is clean, and has updated check out system with the digital pad. There is a cold case by the register with take out containers of to go pasta and sauces. The portion size I saw for one of the pasta dishes looked huge! There were 4 or 5 employees, which actually surprised me, but i took it as a good sign. Dishwasher, I think a chef or two in what I am assuming is training, and I think the famous Paulo, as well as another older looking chef. There was a bit of confusion with my order, one of the items got messed up so I did have to wait a tiny bit longer than normal, but overall, everyone was super nice, and I didn't mind waiting. 

We dug in when we got home, the pasta come with portions of delicious finely crumbled cheese and little rolls of sliced bread. My husband annihilated the raviolis, i got a half of one, and they were indeed tasty, and decadent. My shrimp pasta was hearty and filling and the flavor was something I've never personally tasted, a little sweet, a little tangy, slight creaminess, the tomato was not overpowering at all. I really enjoyed the  taste profile, different than anything I've been exposed to as far as italian goes. Also my pasta was perfect, I was hoping the chef would account for the travel time, and I wouldn't have soft pasta and it was perfectly aldente. 

The burrata was so damn fresh and light. The tomato had flavor imparted on it from the olive oil, seasoning and pesto, and the burrata itself was creamy, light, and barely tangy. A really nice addition to the pasta. 

The cannoli also was filling and hearty, a single one is a lot! I think we both preferred the tiramisu though just barely. Not heavy, light and creamy. 

Overall, we really enjoyed the meal, my husband also gave it 5 stars, and we both want to try other sauces, especially the lasagna or the Bolognese sauce! 

Great addition to the food scene, I hope that by having this simple yet expertly done menu, that they stay alive. It is a good model for to go right now, the food doesn't suffer at all, and once covid ends, can't wait to dine in. Also the to go packaging looks to be sustainable friendly.

We went on a Friday evening at 7 pm and we're able to be seated right away. Tables were decently spread out which is appreciated. Staff wearing masks was hit or miss, I saw a few male waiters who wore masks only covering their mouth which I feel like should be discussed with staff as it is such an easy fix. If it slips down, fine, but these servers did purposefully pull it down that way to leave out their nose. The vibe is trendy, it could get a bit loud for those who are sensitive to that or prefer a quieter place for talking. There were a variety of sports on tv. 

Our waiter got us started with water quick but seemed to forget about our beer. He was seen going up and down the stairs...I'm not sure if he had tables in both places (which doesn't make much sense to me) but if so, can't blame him for forgetting some things! We had to ask for the beer after our food arrived despite it getting ordered in the beginning of our visit. 

Now to the most important part...the food! It is certainly Instagram worthy, as we watched people's orders go by we were very excited for ours to arrive. We ordered the Darth's Burger and Barry C's Stuffed Meatloaf. Both looked amazing when they arrived. The burger was decent but nothing to write home about, the bun and carrot ketchup make it a bit unique. The chips though were extremely disappointing. I'm not sure if they were supposed to be like this, but they were extremely soggy and felt like they had been sitting out for awhile. The sauce was concentrated on one group of chips and the rest were greasy soggy fried potato slices. (As a potato lover it made me so sad  definitely wish there was a fries or other option). Maybe we just had an off day for the chips? But I did notice that a lot of plates had chips left on them at empty tables. The meatloaf was stuffed with Mac and cheese and on a bed of mashed potatoes and peas. The Mac and cheese was ok but nothing special, it said it was bacon jalapeño but if those flavors were there they didn't come through. The meatloaf, mashed potatoes, and peas and little onions were good. 

Overall, I would maybe give this place another chance if friends wanted to go but I wouldn't suggest it. I would still like to try their brunch. I'm hoping it was just an off day and do like to give restaurants the benefit of the doubt in these crazy times.",2021-01-09 01:57:25,536,2522,

I arrived at our reservation time but was told I couldn't be seated until my entire party arrived. I found that odd, it's a pandemic why have guests standing around when there are tables available. The confirmed reservation email didn't state that either. If I would've known this, I would've stayed in my car until my friend had arrived.

Both parties are present time to be seated. The hostess again was a fail. Seat option 1 was right in front of the door, boooo! It's cold out, there's a draft, and there are plenty of open tables further back. Option 2 was right next to option one, I thought she was joking. Option 3 still wasn't what we requested but I was tired of playing her game. Once we were seated, coats off and looking at a menu she returned to say ""I see you requested a booth in your reservation, do you still want that?"" Yes, thank you.

Savor was making me sour before I even tasted any food..then comes Milan our server. He asked if we've dined there before, nope, then proceeded to explain the concept of the restaurant and menu. He answered all of our questions with confidence. I always appreciate when a server knows the menu and freely shares their opinion on menu items. He was exceptional and made me feel like I was speaking with a friend. We smiled, laughed, and felt welcomed. Throughout the experience he was attentive and never had us asking him for anything, was on it on refills, to go containers, dessert menu, etc.

Hostess - needs work
Server - perfection 

The food; all over the board but worth a return
- Spinach baguette; favorite item. If you're a spinach lover, you'll probably enjoy this. The bread has a crisp crust and a chewy airy center. Spinach topping is cheesy and flavorful. The accompanying sauce, spicy goodness
- Crab baguette; disappointing. I should've asked if it was real crab. I don't like imitation crab meat, the baguette is loaded with this stuff
- Wings; my friend ordered lemon garlic wings. She really enjoyed them
- The works pizza; delicious! The red pepper sweetness helps to break up the fattiness of the cheese, pepperoni, and sausage. 

Back to the hostess. Throughout our dining experience we noticed multiple tables seated to be shocked (not really, irritated yes) that people later joined their table. Even the group of three seated next to us had a fourth show up a few minutes later. Hmmm, do the rules change as the night progresses.

Despite the hostess Savor is worth a return. There are several more items on the menu I'm looking forward to trying especially the butter cake and truffle fries. There was also a manager going around checking on patrons, she was nice as well.",2021-01-30 16:32:32,569,2716,

First off, we're in a global pandemic and I'm usually not one of those people who freak out about this type of stuff...but let's face it were in a fucking global pandemic. Walking into the rental car station I was astonished that every single rental car company WAS CLOSED except for two. I wasn't that upset at this point I was just trying to get the car and leave. when I walked into the line i overhear a customer who was arguing with a worker (later found out to be the manager). Not only was this ""manager"" arguing with a customer he was not fucking wearing a mask. It was just dangling on his chin like a piece of jewelry. He told the lady that he couldn't help her and that she had to wait untill he helped the rest of the customers. Whom he actually never fucking helped. I am traveling with my sister so we both walked up to the counter staying an extra 6 feet away from this guy since he still was not wearing a mask. I understand people don't like wearing masks and I'm included in that... but if your working with the general public you should wear one....you don't know where people have been. People are fucking careless.. anyways He basically told us that they didn't have any cars left even though the thrifty's website said they did. We asked him about that and he said ""it just says that...doesn't mean we have any cars"" also saying ""We double book"". Throughout the 5 mins of us being in this conversation this ""manager"" was cutting us off and talking into his radio to other workers complaining about the customer he had prior. STILL NOT WEARING A MASK!!! Do I need to say more?? Fucking terrible. Never again.",2021-01-09 05:00:04,373,1731,

The menu has such a broad variety by including fried rice dishes and seafood, that I had trouble deciding.  So I just ordered a whole mess of stuff for the family, expecting some leftovers.  However, I ate so much that there really weren't any leftovers - and my belly hurt from stuffing so much in it.

The restaurant is very easily accessible, right on St. Charles Rock Road at the end of a small strip center that you can also access from the Ashby Road intersecting there.  Place was spotless inside, and covid precautions & signs were everywhere.  Glad to see them being serious about it.  The lady taking my order (Monica?) was extremely nice.  She was busy, but made me feel like I was important to them too, with her attentiveness and kind & friendly manner.

Lobster fried rice - generous enough to really taste the (tender) lobster.  A little less lobster as I worked my way down the box, though - sneaky - but really savory.  I love that they make the good St. Louis soy/dark fried rice.  That anemic stuff like you get at Panda Express is just sad.

BBLT (beef bacon LT) - don't think I've had beef bacon before.  I like it.  This was a tasty change from pork bacon, adding to what is a fairly standard type of sandwich.  That garlic mayo also helped punch it up.

Spinning chicken fries - nice surprise!  And pretty rich, too.  Thankfully those fries help cut the richness of that dip and cheese.  Great decision to go with thigh meat for the smoked chicken, in my opinion.  It stayed tender and juicy, and soaked up flavor.  Much better than a drier, stringier breast might have been.  And the fries hold up to the dip - well spiced and crispy & thick enough so they don't get soggy.

Brisket - just a good smoky, tender pile of beef with a generous crispy edge.

Candied Brussels sprouts - surprised by this.  I was thinking it would be more of a crunchy type of candied. Instead it was well cooked sprouts in a candied sauce.  Hit the spot with not too much sweetness so that it didn't overpower.

Cinnamon baked beans - the one item I was just 'meh' about.  Basically it's simple baked beans in a sweet cinnamon sauce.  I'd have liked for it to have a mix of other spices or condiments included, but perhaps that wouldn't have worked well with the cinnamon?  Might also be my perception, too, since I'm really more of a fan of pit beans.  Now if they made pit beans and added some sweet cinnamon?!?

Smoked wings - these were yummy!  I got some white Russian sauced, and some dry rub.  The white Russian sauce ones were lip smackers with that tasty sauce.  But those dry rub ones made it for me - really well spiced for flavor, not heat, and the smokiness in the wing meat came right on through.

Chipotle potato salad - bummed that they shorted me on my side of chipotle potato salad though. But I know it happens, especially for large orders that are being prepared in a hurry.  And this type of thing has happened to me three or four times during this covid take-out era, from all kinds of places.  I've gotten in the habit of checking bags before I leave, but you can't really do that when you order nine different things.  However, and I give props to the owner for this - I posted pics of all the food on Facebook with just a quick summary that was basically the top paragraph here and a comment about the missing side, with the company tagged for recognition of the delicious pics.  She commented right away with an apology and and offer to make it right.  When I replied back that I appreciated the gesture but it was too far away to be worth my drive, she said she'd write my name down to include that in my next order.

I don't include the above note on the potato salad to be a jerk.  I try to keep my reviews honest, and point out both what was great and what was not so great.  And this turned out to really wind up being a compliment to the owner for her graciousness and taking care of the customers.

Plus, I still gotta give 5 stars overall.  Couldn't knock down my love for their food, or my knowledge that I'll be back to try even more of all those menu choices.",2021-01-30 20:33:28,889,4215,

I went to look at Kate Spade hand bags and accessories for a birthday present for my aunt. While wandering around checking things out, I was approached by a sales associate asking how she may help me. I explained I was just looking for something Kate Spade, to which she replied ""Unfortunately I don't have anything for you to buy that is on sale"". I was caught off guard, not sure if she was saying what I felt she was implying. I simply replied ""Oh that's fine, I'm not here for a sale, I'm just looking for a birthday present"". She proceeded to stand there while I looked at some accessories, pointing out cheaper options, until I was hurried to check out. Now, I wasn't necessarily looking for a bag or clutch because I wasn't sure what my aunt has or doesn't have because she loves Kate Spade. This felt like a missed opportunity for her to maybe show me the latest collection or wallets or something. To insinuate that I couldn't afford something is an experience I've never encountered before. I left rationalizing her actions, thinking about how I was dressed casual today, in leggings and a sweater, and maybe I didn't look the most put together... but I shouldn't have been treated that way regardless of how I looked. I wasn't going to say anything later, but as today has gone on, I felt more and more upset about my experience. I don't want anyone to feel the way I did today.",2021-01-23 00:26:11,304,1427,

I went yesterday with my wife because I saw on their website that they were now filling growlers with beer, something a lot of places do these days. The growler fill prices were affordable, so I figured it would justify a trip there when their prices are generally high and their plates small. We arrived and had the most wonderful server initially. We put our two big growlers on the table and told her we were there to get growlers filled and to have a snack. She acknowledged that the growler fills were happening and a great deal. We each got a beer and ordered a few snacks. The bread and cheese we got was great, but the five dollar plate of brussel sprouts were tasty, but could have fit in my palm, a really poor food cost to price ratio if you ask me. Still, we did not mind the small size only because we were there to get the good deal on growler fills. Before leaving, we told the server what two beers we wanted in the growlers and she happily left to fill them. She quickly returned and told us vaguely that their liquor license designation had changed and they could no longer do growlers to go. Keep in mind, it is on their website and their printed menu that they do growlers. She apologized shortly, but did nothing else. I get that the servers cannot help if something like this happens, but how it is handled is important. There was a manager near our table the whole time who definitely saw the huge growlers on our table, but did not say anything to us. The manager had also obviously not informed staff of the 86-ed growlers from the jump, as they should have done. When this happened, a manager should have been informed and come to our table to, at the least, apologize and tell us the staff had been informed so it would not happen to the next person. I got the feeling they intentionally waited to tell us so we would still order food and drinks. We ended up paying 30 dollars for two beers, four pieces of bread, a small amount of cheese, and an even smaller amount of brussel sprouts. I tipped properly because it is COVID and everyone is struggling, but this was a matter of having good systems in place which I expect from an established Fox restaurant.",2021-01-06 17:00:00,470,2292,

I went in to the Canal St store today, and was met by a security guard who had a mask down around his neck... as in, not covering his nose or mouth. He continued to speak to me without putting on his mask, ordering me to sign in while standing very close to me. I asked him to put his own mask on, and he said, ""I just took it off."" Hmm. That makes sense!!

Again, I asked him to put his mask on, as he was standing within two feet of me and speaking directly into my face while inside the store. He mocked me. 

He REFUSED to put his mask on. I left. Called Coleman Adler, who said, ""I'm looking at him right now and he has his mask on."" No apology, nothing. Personally, if my name is on the building, I'd take more stock in who is literally representing MY century-old family business, especially to new customers, some with lots of money to spend. And I know 3/4 of the reviewers on Yelp say they were ""planning to spend a lot of money!"" so I won't go down that road. 

Just go Jack Sutton and ask for Liz. Haha

Point is, retail is struggling across the board. Customer service is more important than ever. And people can shop anywhere they want, regardless of whether they have $100 to spend or (in some cases) $100,000. It's SO much easier to point and click and get free overnight shipping these days.

I learned my lesson from last time so we purposefully ordered some dishes without spiciness 

We got:
-spicy crispy roasted lamb shank: this is our favorite dish from them! Always so flavorful and delicious! It's definitely spicy but SO addicting!

-salt and pepper roasted lamb shank: we decided to try this too since it's 50% off and we did not regret it! Even though it sounds really basic, the lamb shank has enough flavor on the inside and is just as good as the other one!

-griddle cooked vegetables with lamb, pork chittering, and fish: ok hands down you need to order this dish every single time you go here. Coming from Chicago, this is one dish that we missed the most and couldn't find it anywhere else in the Tampa area. It is so flavorful and has a great balance of ma (numbing) and la (spiciness)! You can customize it anyway you want with your protein as well! I honestly can't wait for this all to be over so that I can eat this dish when I dine in because it will be even better and crispier.

-Tao's Beef burrito (scallion pancake with roasted beef): this dish reminds me of China so much because we would eat this either as breakfast or as a snack. The flavor is right on point!

-House fried rice: out of the dishes, this might be the only one that did not really pack a punch. Don't get me wrong, it still tastes really good by itself, but it pales in comparison when the rest of the dishes are so flavorful. 

-Eggplants with garlic sauce: this one is really good as well! The only down side to this is that there's a lot of oil so just be careful when you are eating this.

-Peach pudding with milk: this drink is always so refreshing after all that food! I've gotten this every single time we go there now!

-Peach iced tea with cream: if you prefer something on the less sweet side, get this. It is really good by itself and their cheese cream foam is pretty amazing as well!",2021-01-07 02:55:14,438,2052,

This past weekend my wife pulled open the shade in a now vacant upstairs bedroom to reveal a shattered lower pane of glass.  There was no evidence of the window being struck from the outside (window screen is fully intact), and as mentioned, the room has been vacant for months so no contact from inside either.  That said, the sales pitch touted these windows as shatterproof and able to withstand hurricane force winds, so not sure what could have caused this to happen other than a manufacturing defect on a 2 year old window.

Called Power and received excellent service from one of their representatives.  Reason for the poor rating is the result of this call.  I have to pay a fee to have window pane ordered and replaced, and must wait until JUNE to have the work done!  I was told the delay was based on the manufacturer's schedule.  5 months to have a shattered window replaced?  My payment needed upfront just to order the window? 
 No one from Power to come inspect the damage and infer a cause?  No alternate solution in the interim?  I live in Pennsylvania and it's January. 
 Fingers crossed no further damage occurs while I wait until June for resolution.

The quality and service at Bento is always tops - five stars. I have been going to Bento restaurants (in Orlando and Gainesville) for years now so I was super excited for this Tampa location. The restaurant inside is very clean, and spacious. I had no problem dining-in, I was safely distant from other tables. They also have hand-sanitizers installed for you to use and they are following all safety Covid protocols. 

When it comes to their menu, it kind of looks overwhelming at first, because there are so many options for how you want your bento box, rice bowl, poke bowl, or sushi combo box. Once you get through the menu though, you will realize it's quite easy to order what you want and the staff are more than willing to help with any questions you have. The Tampa location menu offers a lot, BUT I AM TRULY SAD about this one item that is missing from the Tampa menu. It is available at other Bento locations and I always order it when I eat at Bento. The item I'm talking about is the SZECHUAN NOODLE SOUP - soy braised brisket, bok choy, scallion with ramen noodles. I even checked on Bento's official website to see if they still have this item on their menu, and they do! It's available in Orlando and other locations in FL, but not Tampa. 

Since I was bummed out about this item not being served at this Tampa location, it kind of dampened my mood to want to eat here. Also, I brought my mom with me to eat here for the first time and raved about how she would love the Szechuan Noodle Soup dish ( my fault for assuming this was offered at the Tampa location and not checking the menu beforehand) But not all hope was lost! They have the Spicy Donburi bowl (tuna or salmon, avocado, masago,cucumber, wakame, spicy mayo) on this Tampa menu which is one of my favorites at Bento. Also, I tried something that I've never gotten before - the Garlic Broccoli Beef Bento Box which was pretty good but I would like to try a different option next time. Honestly, the Szechuan Noodle Soup is my ultimate go-to favorite and since this Tampa location doesn't have it on their menu, I will continue to support Bento at the locations that I am used to going to in Orlando and Gainesville.",2021-01-05 00:18:14,480,2297,

I can get vegetarian and vegan faux ""meat"" dishes that taste like the real thing and have tons of fresh vegetables. They have a massive selection. Quality is really good considering it's not just vegan it's vegan replicating what you love about meat. That is incredibly hard to do. Portion size is generous, the people who work there are really nice, restaurant is super clean with good social distancing set up. The food is fresh and healthy but has that a little suggestion of indulgence that makes you feel like you're having a cheat day meal when really it's like 4 kinds of vegetables and tofu chicken. That makes it a winner in my book. 
The only downside is this: they don't know to handle carry-out orders in an effective way. You can spend half an hour waiting for your food sometimes because they are so disorganized (this part is specific to covid times btw-- I have never dined in there). I am not going to get into details about the nightmare that was ordering for three people from there on New Year's Eve (which may end up being the last time I eat there in a while). I will say that they need to hire someone to help process orders because having my food sit and get cold while they run around discombobulated and disorganized is  getting old. I mean I still go there. The food is amazing. But they seem to have no one working register or bringing up orders: it's a ""whichever employee is closest to the door"" situation.

I have lived at Radius for the past 3 years and the property has gone downhill ever since I moved in. I do digress, the staff that works at the office are phenomenal and super nice, however the property does not live up to the standards that they promise. Let's start shall we. 

First of all, the maintenance sucks! For instance, every time something breaks in these apartments which is often, maintenance takes forever to come and fix it. The apartments were built in the 80's and they ""remodeled"" them to look more modern however it is a bunch of ""quick fixes"" and it breaks down due to the lack of upkeep from maintenance. For example, the drawers keep getting off their tracks and are unable to open/close and maintenance just puts it back on the tracks and then it breaks again the next time you open it. 

Second of all, there are BUGS everywhere, and YOU pay a Pest Control fee every month that honestly goes into the management's pockets. I have had a history of ANTS, ROACHES, SILVERFISH, and a constant DRAIN FLY problem ever since I lived at Radius Palms. I think the drain flies come from not having a GARBAGE DISPOSAL IN THE KITCHEN. Pest control has come to my place many times to fix it, however it is constant due to the plumbing and the lack of upkeep at the property. 

Third of all, You also pay for a ""At-Door Pick up Trash Fee"" for valet trash service, however they do NOT COME TO PICK IT UP. Yes, I said that right. You pay money for them to not do their job. Trash accumulates, and yet again causes bugs. Their policy is they cannot file a complaint unless the trash guy doesn't come 2 days in a row, however, they still do not file a complaint. It is ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. 

I will never renew my lease at a RADCO managed property ever again and hopefully before you sign a lease here you look at the neighbors that live here, you look at your exact apartment, and you know what you are paying for because these apartments are highly expensive for what you actually receive.",2021-01-18 18:13:09,428,2044,

I like this Home Depot (HD). The managers at this store are wonderful, and most of the staff are on point.  I would give this store 3.5 stars if I could because of the bad experience I had when I purchased my washer and dryer.  Additionally, I've had one interaction with an associate that was subpar, but maybe she was having a bad day.  Other than that, the store's stock is ordinarily decent despite it being a busy location.  Parking is ok, but the stalls are short, making parking a more extended truck more difficult.

****Washer and Dryer purchase experience****

I bought a washer and dryer a little while ago, and the experience itself would've caused me to give the store a 1-star rating; luckily, the store manager, assistant store manager, and sales associate helped make it right.

I found out that HD contracts its inventory to a third-party company that supplies the actual unit(s).  This HD's third party supplier is Ralph's Appliances. 

- Bottom Line: this means you're not genuinely buying your appliance from HD; they're simply the middle man.  Don't expect to talk out with your appliance unless you intend to purchase the floor model.

- 1st delivery attempt: the delivery agents from Ralph's were late by 20mins. After the W/D was set up, the dryer wouldn't function properly.  Delivery agents took the defective unit back. I had to wait one week until Ralph's could deliver a new unit.

- 2nd delivery attempt: I received a delivery confirmation phone call from Ralph's 24hrs prior; everything was set for a 7 am delivery the next day.  On the morning of delivery, I received a phone call at 6:59 am from Ralph's stating they'll be unable to deliver because of damage to the unit. The next available delivery date wasn't for two and a half more weeks!  

I called and spoke with HD, and initially, the store employee who answered the phone told me that a loaner dryer was unavailable.  Luckily, I got in touch with the store manager Lisa who arranged a loaner for me that was brand new.

- 3rd delivery: I received the dryer on time and no issues!  I was excited to receive the unit because it took nearly a month.  

Lisa and the assistant store manager, James, were excellent and turned this negative experience around from HD.  It's a shame that HD contracts their inventory out, but they're not the only company that does it; Lowe's does too.",2021-01-01 01:57:38,504,2389,

The housekeeping did not place my dishes in the dishwasher and start the cycle as item #8, on the list of instructions left to me by the hotel, said they would do. They did not replenish the soaps and shampoos. They did not leave a roll of toilet paper. The phone in the room did not work, and as I later discovered, they knew this prior to my check-in. They had said it was a problem in the wall and could not fix it with my family and I in the room. They did offer to move me to another room. It was a smaller room without a hair dryer and alarm clock on the nightstand, as the previous room had,
I was booked here for 6 nights! All of the things I mentioned should have been important for someone spending 6 nights at a hotel. I emailed the assistant GM, about maybe a comp. Still to this day (1 week later), I have received no reply from the hotel.
This hotel appears to also be a staging ground for a lot of the local riff raff before they go out for the night, as there were clothing tags from Fashion Nova strewn about. So expect a lot of cars with loud music coming and going throughout the night. There was a gentleman smoking a joint in the parking lot as he walked passed me while he was cussing at his girlfriend and talking about ""smack[ing] [someone] in the mouth.""

Shout out to the wonderful manager whose name I don't know but you're always super nice when I go in! Plus I don't feel the judgment (even tho there should be some judgement how much I go here! ) 

My go to absolute favorite meal is their steak bowl. What I love most about this place is how much you get FOR FREE! Want extra rice? Free. Want extra beans? Free (though not for me I don't like beans). Want queso on your item? Free. Want guacamole on your item? Free. Extra fajita veggies? Free! I think you get it, but honestly don't get me wrong I love me some chipotle and Moes, but I don't love them as much as I love Qdoba. 

They have such a variety of menu to choose from I know that if I ever venture out of my bubble of comfort food, I'd still find something I'd like. If you don't know about it, download the app and sign up for the rewards program. It's a tiered program that the more you visit the more points you earn. I'm embarrassed to admit but in two months I've made it to tier 3.. and I'm not far from making it to tier 4. Tier 4 has a monthly mystery perk! So I'm excited to see what it is. The app has random offers so keep your notifications on! I've gotten free chips & guac, free delivery, etc. and I've only had the app for two months. More than I've gotten from chipotle and I've had their app for over a year now! 

This location has some pretty friendly crew members, but I have to say I like the crew in the afternoons a little more than the crew I've had at night. This location is super convenient, but the parking lot can be a disaster sometimes. All in all, still one of the best fast food restaurants in the area.",2021-01-29 05:49:45,426,1824,

I was on the hunt for some inspo fabrics for a quilting project for a friend and am SO glad I checked Yelp and found Quilt Quarters!  As soon as we walked in, we were greeted warmly by the manager who personally walked us around the store, answered questions, and explained that the store had recently been taken over by a new owner due to the retirement of the previous owner.  Rumor is, the previous owner had been paring down the store offerings in expectation of retirement - and the NEW owners have been diligent in ramping up the offerings since they took it over!  There were SO many things to see - full quilt kits, patterns, TONS of fabrics, etc.  I could have spent hours in here - but we arrived too close to closing time.  I LOVED that the fabrics were sorted in to general 'genres' and also by color - SUPER easy to find something in the color family you want.  

I also droooooled over the long arm machines, tables, and displays.  There are pre-made quilts for sale in the side room, and it appears that they offer classes in that room as well (in non-covid times).  I loved that they display a full, completed quilt next to most of their quilt kits so you could SEE what the quilt would look like once finished - and the kits were VERY reasonably priced.  I also dug it that there were completed quilts EVERYWHERE to look at and gain inspiration from.  Now I want to do all of the projects!

I will totally be back again soon.  It does not hurt that they are basically across the street from my favorite brewery, too.  Note to self: Deviate beers AFTER fabric shopping.",2021-01-22 14:40:44,339,1651,

These train hotel rooms are at the Crowne Plaza Hotel at Union Station in downtown Indianapolis, which was the first Union Station in the United States (and it continues to be a real working station today). Crowne Plaza also has regular hotel rooms, but if you want the train experience, ask for the Pullman Train Rooms.

Thirteen real train cars have been converted into hotel rooms, and the train cars even sit on a real train track. All cars are named after famous early- to mid-20th century people, including Charlie Chaplin, Jean Harlow, Winston Churchill and Amelia Earhart, to name a few. Our family was given a room on the green line, and our hotel room was named after P.T. Barnum, the American showman who founded Barnum & Bailey Circus.

Inside the train car is a cozy and streamlined hotel room. Because the room is inside a real train car, the room is more rectangular than a typical hotel room, with several windows lining one wall. You can request a train room with either two double beds or a room with one king bed.

Union Station is a real working train station, so when we checked in, the attendant told us we might feel the vibrations of trains passing by. And we did! It wasn't disruptive at all, and honestly, if we weren't trying to notice it, we might not have. But the gentle rumbling that happened every so often just added to the ambiance of sleeping in a real train car.

The Crowne Plaza Hotel has a pool inside the hotel, but when our family visited, the pool was closed due to COVID-19 restrictions. Instead, we trekked around the hotel in search of the ""ghosts"" that were located throughout all three stories of the hotel: 28 life-sized, white statues that pay homage to the history of the hotel and Union Station. We spotted flapper girls, nuns, shoe-shiners and even a trio of boys trying to hitch a ride on a train.

We also walked around Union Station and learned a bit about its long and storied history. It was fun reading the plaques that told about the history of the hotel, and glimpsing the beautiful architecture all around us.

Sleeping in a real train hotel room was a fun and unique experience for my family -- one that we'll never forget!",2021-01-03 23:00:22,484,2365,

Being exposed to great chefs' foods in LA, Las Vegas and NY, Owyhee Tavern had some of the best tasting dishes we have had! As of 6 years in Idaho, this has been the best restaurant for quality and taste. We try different restaurants as much as possible. Most we wouldn't go back to. But, we will make this Owyhee Tavern our #1 go to. Service was excellent with our server Chelsea as well. We will have to get pictures next time of each dish. Between two of us, we order for about 4-6 ppl when trying restaurants new to us, or if we really love the food. We went in because of the FB ad showing a 3 course dinner for $30. I called to see if I needed to make reservations, but was told that it wasn't very busy at that moment, and to just come in when we want. The ambiance is warm, nice and clean. We sat in the bar area tables where we could watch our hockey game. Our orders were the prime beef fondue for appetizer, the $30, 3-course meal of a nice house salad, braised short rib and pumpkin spiced cheesecake, the $45, 3-course meal of a wedge salad, Tavern Oscar filet mignon, flourless chocolate torte, also the lobster pasta and drinks. They space out the courses. Everything came out at the perfect temperature and tastes were on point! Even the green beans on the side of the braised short rib and filet had the right amount of seasoning. The prime beef fondue was so good with the warm, soft bread they give instead of the bruschetta type toast and chips it comes with, a very rich appetizer. It's pretty filling. The house salad is big compared to most side salads we see at other restaurants. The braised beef was so tender and melts in your mouth,. With a bite of the creamy mashed potatoes, together this dish was exceptional! The Tavern Oscar filet had a silky crab lump sauce that complimented the perfectly cooked steak. Let's not downplay the lobster pasta. It has the right amount of garlic, portobello mushrooms, spinach, in a beautiful sauce with cheese. The pumpkin spiced cheesecake was decent. But, the flourless chocolate torte in a raspberry sauce was like eating a decadent truffle. Our taste experience was that up there with Gordon Ramsay's restaurants! If you've dined at his steakhouse or Hell's Kitchen, you know. I'll be honest, in the years living in the Treasure Valley, we had yet to find one restaurant that met our standard and liking to come back over and over. Until..we found this gem!

My husband and I have been going to Comic Kingdom to get our collectibles for a few years and the restaurant two doors down has always been something I've wanted to try. It took a name change and a breakfast menu to get me in I guess. 

After searching for breakfast ""near me"" on my Yelp app, D'licious Caffe popped up. I called ahead to see if they were busy and if I needed a reservation which I did not. 

My husband and I showed up at 9am. As stated before it was not busy yet but I'm sure it was still early. The place is small but cozy. There was nice music playing and it smelled like breakfast. There is a sign on the door for the delivery drivers to wait outside for their orders. I appreciated this very much since we are all trying to be responsible and social distance.

Our server was very welcoming. I asked him what he liked on the menu and he gave me some suggestions. I wanted biscuits and gravy but I decided on a different menu item. This will give me a reason to go back.

The food came out quickly and it was hot. I ordered the Classic Egg Combo with black coffee. I chose scrambled eggs, bacon and sourdough toast as my options. The eggs were fluffy and seasoned well and the bacon was crispy. The sourdough peices were tiny (not a complaint) I don't know if it was the end of the loaf or if they are always that size. I can't ever finish my toast so the small slices were welcome. I enjoyed every bite of the hashbrowns. Those were seasoned perfectly. Also, the coffee was yummy! 

My husband ordered Crepes with Strawberries. He enjoyed them and is quoted as saying ""they were pretty good""

We were glad to have made the trip to D'licious Caffe this past week. I will be sharing my experiences with my fellow breakfast lovers and sending them business.",2021-01-23 19:48:49,386,1823,

We both wanted to try something new and we found this place. We hadn't tried Bosnia food before and figured it's as good a time as any since it was on the way back to her apartment. She perused the menu in the car and we placed the order for pick-up. I got the Bosnian Meatballs and a slice of baklava, and she got the Bosnian sausages. We also got the stuffed grape leaves to share. Both of the main dishes come with homemade bread. They wrapped it separately in foil so we could share it. After picking up the food and driving back to her apartment, the food smelled so good I was afraid I'd start eating it there and get tomato sauce all over myself. 
Let me start off by saying if you're like me and you haven't heard of this place before, you're in for a treat. This restaurant was featured on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives (Season 28, Episode ""Seafood & Savory""). The chef runs the restaurant with his wife & son. If you watched the episode, you'll know a) he is a survivor of the Bosnian War, having have been taken prisoner and brutally beaten, and b) his love of cooking stems from working with his mother at her restaurant.  It's hard not to admire this guy who came from a warzone, was relocated to Tucson and achieved his dream of opening his own restaurant. 
 I haven't been able to go back b/c my husband hates trying new food and also it's a bit of a drive for me. But I loved the food and I especially love the bread. If you haven't been here before, GO! You won't regret it.",2021-01-04 22:04:23,348,1565,

I needed work on my gutters because after having my three-year-old gutters removed and reset during a ""new"" two-year-old roof job I discovered while hanging Christmas lights they were not pitched correctly. There was at least a 1/2 inch of water throughout and the corners dripped which just really irritated me to no end. It was why I had them replaced originally! I certainly did not want water damage to my house because of lousy gutters.

After checking Yelp, I came across J&M Gutter Pros. They may have not had many reviews, but they were all 5-star and I liked that it was a family owned business that has been around a while.

I contacted them via Yelp Messenger, and had a few back and forth messages about the job and I was even given exact pricing during our ""conversations."" I was happy that they were willing to install gutter guards that I had already previously purchased although they had their own available. 

Two J&M employees came earlier than our scheduled time, made quick work of the pitch problem, installed the gutter guards, and appropriately followed COVID-19 protocol. Although we had discussed about an additional downspout, they did not feel it would be necessary after the pitch correction which saved me money. I was also very happy that they did not try to have me believe that I'd have to replace the gutters instead of fixing the problem. Very honest company.

To fix the problem of the pitch was only $100. The gutter guard installation for which I provided the parts was an additional $520 which was charged by the foot. With tax it came to about $670 for the almost three-hour job.  They were very efficient!

I highly recommend J&M Gutter Pros for your job. Thank you for being an honest company with no BS sales pitches for work I didn't need. They did the job that needed to be done and did it well.",2021-01-05 22:09:47,389,1923,

Here's what sucks the worst: I go here all the time. See, I like McDonald's caramel iced coffee, and this place is real close to my job, so I keep going and having to hope something will be different. It never is. 

I'll start with the obvious. They're incompetent, and mess your order up a lot. I get it, it's a McDonald's. They're not brain surgeons back there, but it's also a character issue. One time I had a woman hand me a bag and a drink and say ""#5 with a diet Coke right?"" and I said, ""No, regular Coke."" and she said ""That's what I meant to say, my bad. Regular Coke."" and then looked me straight in the face and handed me a diet Coke. That's not a mistake. That's just purposefully being a bad employee.

Sometimes I go and they're just inexplicably closed. One time I showed up and someone was at the drive thru speaker just to tell everyone they're closed because nobody else showed up for their shift and she was the only one there. What? 

Last thing I'll say is that they have no concept of how to talk to people. They have never once said ""Thank you"" or ""Have a nice day"" or even acknowledge me when I say those things. They seriously just hand me my food, I say ""thank you"", or ""have a good one"" and they close the window. Recently I asked for my regular caramel iced coffee, and the girl on the speaker said ""No."" I was like, "".. Any reason why I'm not allowed to get a coffee?"" and she said ""Cuz we ain't got it. Get something else."" 

In closing, holy shit this place sucks.",2021-01-18 15:46:30,416,1708,

I didn't realize that this was the result of a recent renovation from what it used to be, and I have to say, I much prefer this than the last one!  The place looks roomier, and I was happy to note that they were seating patrons according to the Covid guidelines.  I ordered the BBQ plate with flame-broiled pork and shrimp with fried rice.  Kurtis, the owner, brought my order out, and introduced himself.  He also included a to-go menu in the bag, and wrote a short note.  I've written before that these seemingly small details make a huge difference, at least for me.  It makes the experience personal and helps me feel invested in the establishment's success.  The second time was through the Yelp Elite Perk event (see separate review), and the third one was as last minute dinner decision over the weekend.  This time, we did the ordering online with delivery.  ijji actually has their own app where you can place an order, and that's what we used.  This was on a Saturday night, so it took about an hour from the time we placed the order to the time it actually got delivered.  Also, the app did not have a place to add tip, so we tipped the delivery person upon delivery.  As for the food, we ordered the Chicken Karrage,  the Spring Roll, the No. 1 Combination Pho, and The Sumo poke bowl.  I was most excited about the chicken karrage, and although it had good flavor, but somehow they forgot to include either the ponzu or or spicy mayo dipping sauces.  I was super bummed I had to improvise with my own ketchup and mayo sauce.  The paper menu says the Spring Roll order has 4 pieces (the app did not mention qty).  We only got 2.  Hubs ordered the poke bowl, and he said it's good, but could probably use more dressing.  The pho was good and loaded with meat, but I would've preferred the rice (thinner) noodle. 
Overall, despite the couple issues mentioned, I would still recommend at least giving Ijji Noodle house a try.",2021-01-24 22:29:08,440,2048,

So that's great! The doctor was also able to do a consultation and surgery within the same appointment which other offices would not accommodate. We had some reservations coming to this office as both my mother and sister in law came to this office and were not treated very kindly by the staff.
My only complaint is when we checked in for the appointment the front desk girl told me that I wasn't aloud to leave once the surgery started!! I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT! What a ridiculous rule! I had brought our daughter because my husband had to check in for an early AM appointment and my plan was to drop my husband off, go drop my daughter off at school and come right back. I was told that I was not aloud to do that! That really upset me! I had to then rush to drop my daughter off with a family member so they could take her to school. The front desk girl stated ""I have In my note that we gave you the entire NPO."" That's when I about lost it! I also work in the medical field and am very good at following directions. I would have never brought my daughter if that information was accurately relayed to me. After speaking with some other people who work in the medical field, they were shocked to hear that this is even a rule! 
My advice to this office is if you are going to have  very specific rules, slow down and explain it more clearly and make sure the patient understands the expectations clearly. When I got home and looked at my notes from when I scheduled the appointment, all it said was patient must have a ride. That's it! Not that I was being forced to stay there until the surgery was over!

Dr. Falke and the surgical/MA assistant were so friendly and professional and it's a shame that now a third family member has had a not so great experience with the staff.  I would give this office one more chance only because I respect the doctor.",2021-01-08 03:35:26,419,2026,

I made a reservation on Open Table and when I arrived at the restaurant my table was immediately available, no waiting at all. Service was amazing and I am sorry I didn't take the name of the server as she was very patient with us as we waited for a friend who was lost trying to find the restaurant. They have their own parking lot but if you don't come from the main road, the entrance is easy to miss. The lot was also full, but thankfully there is plenty of parking in the neighborhood on the street right behind it with no restrictions or costs during the weekend afternoon. 

Ambiance is cool and it's a versatile restaurant. Some  people were dressed casually; some people seemed to be there for celebrations; some people were dressed in their brunch's best. I don't think you will feel out of place, no matter what reason you are there. 

Everyone at the table enjoyed their food. Shrimp & grits: It comes with pieces of bacon & mushrooms, which you can request on or off. It is very rich and fulfilling so I could not finish it there. It tasted even better the second day at home. One negative: I never like when restaurants leave the tail on shrimp that is not meant to be consumed with my hands. Having to take the tail off with my hands through something that soup-like such as the grits is an unnecessary & unpleasant step. But if you can deal with that, it's worth it because the shrimp is good and the grits were cooked properly.

Banana cheesecake pastry: I would give 5 stars for this dessert alone. It's a pastry with banana & caramel cheesecake stuffed inside. It's my new favorite thing  (I don't like bananas so this is high regards). Not sure if the outside is fried or baked, but it's perfectly crispy without being greasy. They don't skimp on the cheesecake filling & it doesn't come out when you bite into it like some pastries.

We broke up once as I was tired of the employees pushing unnecessary medications, tests, etc. WARNING: If you don't push back and question if these ""recommended"" procedures/products are needed, your bill can quickly triple in cost.

I had the worst experience this past week with Banfield. Firstly, my dog is a senior dog and does NOT do well during her dental cleaning. In the past, it would take 2 days for her to recover from the heavy sedation and would shake for a day and a half afterwards. It's heartbreaking to witness. I always bring this concern up with the staff when booking the dental appointments.

On Wednesday, I dropped her off at 7am. My dog gets panic attacks at her appointments so my main goal is to get her in and out as fast as humanly possible. In the past, she has been discharged as early as 2:30pm. I carried on with my day but started to get concerned that Banfield had not called me back by 11am. I called and was told that she was ""next up"" as there was a spay ahead of her that had complications. At 4:52 pm, I called back as they close at 6pm. Again, they mentioned the spay and many unforeseen issues with OTHER pets. At this point, she had been waiting 10 HOURS for a dental cleaning and had been bumped to the back of the line. I mentioned that I was concerned that they were closing in an hour. They assured me they would complete the cleaning. At 6:01, Banfield called me to tell me: my dog had just been sedated, they were starting her cleaning, and she would be ready at 6:30pm. How ridiculous is that? It felt cruel that my dog had to suffer all day as Banfield didn't have their shit together. It appears that they don't have enough people on staff to handle the workload which is absolutely unprofessional. Their communication was terrible. My dog was heavily sedated and whimpering for hours that evening. Do not take your beloved pets here!!!",2021-01-01 20:39:58,405,1941,

I am an American and was born in Reno but I guess this guy just assumed I am illegal because I don't look like him?  Guess what bud, Americans come in all shapes, sizes and COLOR. On top of that he told me I just bought the last one. But when I came back a few days later to pick up after my background check went through I noticed a brand new G43X on display. I could be wrong and they may have received a new shipment but the timing of it all just makes you think. And upon picking up the staff member who ""assisted"" me was just a big bowl of sunshine. Said all of maybe 4 words didn't even call me over I just happened to see him clearing the pistol and I walked over. He handed me the pistol and that was that. Straight to the point and no fuss I guess? Just don't see how being closed off and unfriendly helps with sales. But with the fascism going on in the country I'm sure these guns sell themselves. Overall great selection of guns and accessories and they are good about posting the ammo available but I'll be shopping elsewhere for my next firearm.",2021-01-28 21:47:39,326,1549,

The very first place we ate at was Inca's. We never had Peruvian food before but we heard good things. Part of what drew us to this place was the fact that it was recommended by Guy Fieri; they even have him on their menu! lol Inca's did not disappoint.

Ambience: We had to sit outside per Covid rules, so I can't really comment on the ambience of the inside; they fortunately had heat lamps outside.

Drinks: The pisco sour was great, but I was not blown away. The drinks I really enjoyed, that I never tried before, were the Inca Cola and the Chicha Morada. Both were delicious (and non-alcoholic). 

Appetizers: We had the Papa rellena, which I highly recommend. My wife liked it so much she wanted to go back again just for that. 

Main Dishes: We (mainly I) ate a lot of food here so we tried different things. We had a half Pollo a la brasa, which is their Peruvian style chicken. It was good but I think the meat was a little on the dry side. We also had tamales and the spicy ceviche de pescado. 

We liked this place so much that we ate here AGAIN before we left for Houston. The second time we ate here, we had the Lomo Saltado and Jalea de Mariscos. Naturally my wife re-ordered the Papa rellena, which was excellent, like the first time. 

Overall, I highly recommend this place to anyone who is interested in trying out Peruvian food or loves Peruvian food!",2021-01-27 22:53:24,318,1474,

From the time they started to lease the apartment out they had a big meth bust here, you can ask any greenwood cop and they would tell you stay clear of this place. Further more a few weeks ago the IMPD swat team was here serving a warrant for a man that knew people here. Sure he didn't leave here but the fact that swat and the cops had to show up makes this community not safe for anybody. Further more I have also seen lots of drug dealers going around too and lots of people smoking weed in there cars which is another reason why there is no parking you say you will kick car out that don't belong but never have another lie after another lie. Which bring me to my next point there is no parking at night NONE you have to legit walk a block to get back to your house not safe, how can you expect people to wanna move in when you have no system to park people like what. Which brings me to my next point where the hell is the pool? There's no pool and it probably won't be done till next summer get it together gables you say no noise after 9PM but yet I hear people screaming and fighting and cars music and little kids screaming.

A man by the name of Bridger in their fraud department, though I was informed by a specialist in their organization just yesterday that they would not withhold the stimulus money because they recognize how important it is, said he was going to override that and not give it to me. I insisted that was not correct and they asked me to come to the branch and they should honor that since I tried to avoid this even before it was deposited and they wouldn't let me close the account. 

BRIDGER THEN HANGS UP ON ME AND WHEN I CALL BACK TO REPORT HIS BEHAVIOR TO HIS SUPERVISOR HE ANSWERS THE CALL AND THREATENS MY FREEDOM BY STATING THAT IF I COME BACK TO ANY BRANCH AGAIN I WILL BE ARRESTED FOR TRESPASSING. HE THEN HANGS UP ON ME AGAIN. Because he was acting inappropriately with me I was insisting to speak with his supervisor in a more animated fashion and then the branch manager comes down to the lobby where only I was and threatens me with police as well if I don't leave. I clearly told her I was on the phone with members of her organization that were wronging me and instead of offering help, she threatened my liberty as well if I did not leave.

My first time here, my server was Justin and he did such an awesome job. This time, my server was Rachel, she was super sweet, very attentive and did an amazing job making sure our drinks didn't get low. I want to just take the time to shout out both Justin and Rachel for being great at what they do. It's rare to find an establishment where everyone is just friendly and attentive. I brought up Justin's name to Rachel and she must've told him, so when he got on shift, he actually stopped by our table to say hello. 
The ambiance was awesome, they had some speakers and a dj set up and he was definitely playing some good music, because we were vibing out. The outdoor dining had some tables with a sort of enclosed area that was warm because I didn't even need to wear my jacket. It definitely was enjoyable. 

Moving on to the food, everything was good. I ordered the morning tacos which were plenty and yummy. my brother ordered the chicken chilaquiles and it looked amazing, I didn't have enough room to try it but he enjoyed it (I'll get it next time). But the star of the show was the coconut French toast... idk what they do to it but it was so gooooood! My brother even ordered an other serving (extra charge) because he liked it so much.

Typically the coffee is great, atmosphere is pleasant, and the staff is quite friendly. However, recently the customer service and COVID-19 protocols have been sincerely alarming and make supporting this local business personally challenging. 

This past week I went into Handlebar about an hour before closing. At the time there were a few people waiting outside for their drinks but I was the only customer in the store. The person taking at the register didn't greet me and when I tried to be friendly and say ""good morning"" they still didn't say a word which was off putting and extremely awkward. Still without saying anything, they continued to stare at me while I didn't know if they were ready to take my order or if something was going on behind the scenes that I was unaware about that would prevent them from taking my order. After an uncomfortable 10 seconds of silence I ordered and payed and walked away, still without a word from anyone behind the counter. 

While I felt slightly uneasy, what made me truly upset was the lack of COVID precautions. When my name was called for my coffee I asked for a lid, and the barista pointed to a stack of lids on the counter and said, in a condescending tone, ""uh yeah they're right there"". Personally, I didn't feel comfortable touching a stack of about 50 lids, and also didn't like the idea that customers throughout the day had been touching the same lids I was about to drink out of. What made it even more upsetting was the fact that the employee made me feel like I was dumb for not just grabbing a lid, when  that seems absurd during these times. 

Overall, I felt like the experience wasn't worth the $8 for the coffee. More importantly, there seems to be a culture of judgement/mistreatment unless you are a regular or somehow fit their idea of the ""Handlebar"" customer. I hope to see some changes because I truly enjoy the quality of their coffee and want to continue to support local business.",2021-01-13 20:43:02,414,2088,

I had to call like 4 times just to put my order because they don't pick up, and usually I don't mind because my order is correct. The lady who took my order said they would be ready in 1 hr. I had ordered 4 rolls so it was nothing outrageous. Arrived 10 minutes before and the lady said it would be like 10 min more. She then told my husband it was $20. My husband was like no we had 4 Rolls. She said she had but accidentally switched our name to a different order. We waited and additional 40+min after that . When she finally called us to pay she would not take my money because she kept saying it was fake money because I was paying with a $100 bill. I was already really upset because I had been waiting so I said something to her and she didn't care, I ended up going to the smoke shop next door and they checked my bill confirmed it was real and gave me 5 $20 bills. I requested to speak to a supervisor or to have the # for the owner and she refused. She told me I can call the store to speak to him. I told her that when I call they don't answer and I usually have to call multiple time and if I can please have a direct #. She still refused so we just took our food and came home. I had to come back and return my food because one of the rolls was wrong.  two of my plates had the rolls all over the place like they just threw them in which I would not have mind if my order was correct. She then insinuated that I was the one who messed up the plates when you can clearly see they had not been touched and that she had given me an incorrect roll.

If you come down Cotton Street from Manayunk Ave you'll see the old sign for Common Grounds which was a nuisance bar, and part of the reason it took the Ginger's so long to get open. Good riddance to them, and welcome to Twisted Gingers! They almost didn't make it, and that's reflected in their ""2 Votes NEIPA"" as that's how closely they slid by to get local approval.

It's an interesting space that has a kind of retro vibe to it, but at the same time it's fairly sparse and ""Spartan"". The upside to that is that it gives it a more open feel. The old tile floor is interesting but it was unfortunately unrepairable. The painted mirror back bar is at least interesting enough though. Otherwise you're on your own, but I say 'Hey, make you're own fun, no one needs to entertain you'. Being an old-timer I was told as a kid, ""get out of the house and down't come back until dinner time"".

Anyway, I diverge. There are 9 beers on tap, and I think there's a possibility for more if needed. The list seems to be seasonally influenced (pumpkin beer in fall, Christmas ale in winter, etc.) but they always have Mayer Light and at least one, if not two IPAs, as well as some Belgian styles which will probably contain a wheat. They haven't been open that long but I expect that the variety will continue. All of the beers that I've had have been good, and I'll gladly stop in whenever I have time. Beyond their own beer they also serve hard cider, wine, and hard seltzer from Pennsylvania producers.

As for food, well this isn't exactly a brew-pub but more of a brewery-tasting room. There's popcorn, hot dogs, chili, Mac & Cheese, Meat & Cheese plates, and rotating specials. It's basic stuff but what do you expect? - UPDATE: They now offer pizza and it's incredibly good - I'm not kidding!

In the end I'm happy to call Twisted Gingers my local brewery and I expect them to not only continue what they're already doing so well, but also to improve along the way.",2021-01-02 00:19:31,474,2150,

Trouble's End has been around for a lil' bit now, but in true beer-snobbery we wanted to wait until they offered their owns brews for tasting before visiting. Worth. The. Wait.

We've been twice for brunch, because you really can't beat the plethora of delicious food offerings. There's both sweet and savory, simple and complex, traditional and unconventional. Want a bagel and lox? You're golden. Want Cinnamon Toast French Toast? You got it, babe. Eggs? Meats? Cheese? All three? Done. Done. Done. 

I've personally sampled the short rib Benny and the Philly Hash. The portions are perfect, and I'm usually satiated for the remainder of the day. The has was particularly beautiful with two-perfectly poached eggs a top a combination of potatoes, ribeye, longhots, and whiz. Like, honestly what more could you want from a dish? I also had a bite of my boyfriend's pork roll burger. (He hasn't stopped raving!) It was admittedly a stand-out dish.

Don't worry! There's even options for our vegan and vegetarian friends. 

While the food is the star, their beer is solid, too. I'm a fan of their hoppy grissette - Wind Solo. It's refreshingly drinkable. Further, I LOVE that their beers are on the lower ABV end of things. When you're having a brew before noon, it's not the intention to get goofy. The beers are light in alcohol, but smooth and flavorful. I've tasted their Bitter, Oatmeal Stout, and Smoked Pale Lager - all very good beers. They also have a nice rotation of guest beers, fun cocktails, and wine.

Just when you thought it couldn't get better - it does. Lots of parking! The great indoor ambiance with many TVs, optional heated outdoor seating for the sunny days,  and spacious spaces make it an awesome spot for gatherings (when things are normal again!) I am also always impressed with their kind staff. After you stuff yourself silly, take a nice walk on the nearby trail or stroll into downtown Collegeville to burn the cals.

I've come in countless times as I work nearby, and Dr. Bolenbaker goes above and beyond as a professional. All the employees are kind and cheery. I can only recall Frances but there are two others I have personally met. The receptionist, Amy, is a pleasure to talk to. In one of my recent visits, after my annual checkup, I had considered getting contacts as the glasses fog from masks was quite annoying (not to mention I am always always cleaning them, which is to be expected). I've worn glasses for years. When getting fit for contacts, I struggled quite a bit with my reflexes and started overheating. I have always been extremely twitchy when it comes to my eyes and such, but I nearly fainted after a struggle to get it in my eye. Had to lay on the floor until my vision came back and they brought me water. I was told I have something called Vasovagal Syncope-- I cannot believe I have gone my whole life without knowing this and it explains SO MUCH. Such as being extremely uneasy around the talk of blood or anatomy to the point of almost fainting, struggling very badly with eye drops, makeup, and the air being blown in my eyes, and having trouble getting my blood pressure taken anywhere or dealing with extreme prolonged heat exposure. I thought this was normal and the only reason I am including it in my review is to note how validating it was to finally have an explanation.

This store is clean. The bathroom is clean. Their Covid-19 system and policies work well and it's overall a joy to come to. They were also very understanding when I had a pair of sunglasses that kept falling down my nose to no avail-- exchanged for free as a one time courtesy. Sticking with metal frames for sure. I've also purchased a pair of very nice eyeglasses and had née lenses installed in my previous frames. Professionals through and through. Cannot recommend enough.",2021-01-13 09:02:51,383,1896,

Let's start with COVID: staff are masked up, social distancing is being enforced, sanitizer is on your table, QR code menus etc. My partner and I sat indoors, and we were 6 feet from the next tables that were positioned behind us and none to the side of us. It was extremely clean, and I liked the wall decor.

We aren't strategic eaters we're just eaters so we ordered the same thing, LOL, chicken and waffles. In all fairness, I was going to get the 'tots' dish, but it's made with dairy that cannot be removed (dietary restriction). 

The experience I would've given a 5 and the food a 3. Maybe it was an off day because what was lacking was FLAVOR. The syrup, which is called out on the menu for having vanilla bean in it was plain syrup according to my taste buds. I've had plain pure Vermont maple syrup with more flavor.

The chicken was fried to perfection (great breading and super juicy for breast), so you can imagine my disappointment when it was essentially flavorless, LOL. I ended up asking for Cholula hot sauce because it was a such a waste of well prepared chicken. The waffle was fine. I liked the density not too airy and not too thick; it holds up well to the chicken and syrup. I believe there were a few pieces of fried thyme leaves that were working overtime to save the flavor review. I ordered a latte that was fine--a little too foamy for my taste. However, I do appreciate that they have almond milk in addition to soy and dairy milk. Sometimes in these type of establishments they haven't hopped on the non-dairy milk train just yet.

My partner ordered the scrapple and said it reminded him of his childhood--whatever that means, lol. He ate it all. 

Service was attentive and fast. Our server, Michelle, was lovely. I had never been to the Wynnewood area and for a suburb it seemed very metro. Sabrina's happens to be located right at a train stop in a shopping center, and an added bonus is hassle-less parking! 

It's worth a try, and since there are multiple locations, I'd try it again for a different dish.",2021-01-23 19:42:45,478,2236,

I recently sold my old Rolex to them and of course anyone selling their Rolex that they paid a crap load for and work their a$$ off for would be very stressed and worried on selling it for the best price possible and not getting screwed over especially when its all done online. I contacted them and Jeff was very straight forward and honest with me(probably too honest if we are keeping it all the way REAL). I explained to them the issues I had with other potential buyers and the wide range of offers I was getting. So Jeff was able to not only match but beat my best offer by a lot too he beat it by about an extra $600! On top of that Jeff overnighted me a box to place my Rolex in to overnight back to him and Jeff took care of everything all the costs of shipping and said they do a 48hour inspection and then he'll overnight the check to me. He took only 1 business day and said its all good and overnighted me the check for the Rolex for the exact amount he promised me, (where again many of their competitors tell you one price offer and then screw you and lower the offer once the Rolex is in their hands). 

I suggest if you are selling or buying a Rolex sell and buy from these guys Harold Freeman Jewelers and they will take excellent care of you in the most efficient honest excellent way!

Porco's shares a storefront with it's bakery (Small Oven Pastry Shop), which provides the bread for the sandwiches - a pretty great collab, if you ask me! Their hours are a little tight, closing at 6PM most nights, so we made plans to pick up in the late afternoon on a Sunday. My fiancee was easily able to order and pick-up our order in a COVID-safe way, and he commented that the staff was extremely friendly and actually really excited that we had the $5 coupons to use. Definitely great marketing on Porco's end! Our friend gave a few recs on his favorite sandwiches, and based on those and the Yelp reviews, I opted for the OG Philly and my fiancee for the Cubano. WOW. Both were so good. For starters, the bread was fantastic - the ciabatta was perfectly crisp yet soft enough to easily bite into. You could 100% tell it was homemade, and it was so good. The OG Philly featured the classic porchetta and pork cracklings, but was nicely accompanied by pesto and sharp provolone. The pesto definitely had a bite to it and was unlike other pestos I've had before - I don't know if I would put it on a pasta, but it paired really nicely with the pork. The provolone was excellent in bringing it all together too. The sandwich itself was chockful of meat - I was really impressed with the quantity and quality! While I likely should have had just half of the sammy, it was too good to stop - I was incredibly full after, but 100% worth it. My fiancee really enjoyed his cubano too, which featured the porchetta but with pickled veggies to give an extra pop of flavor and crunch. This was all accompanied by a mustard aioli, which brought it all together. He was a huge fan and was so sad when the sandwich was gone! We couldn't pass up the bakery either, so we split a s'mores bar - this was OK, not the best dessert I've had, but the chocolate as incredibly rich and the graham was on point. The mallow topping had trouble staying on the bar, so we wound up eating that alone, but we appreciated the flavors of the entire dessert. 

Overall, Porco's is a slam dunk - from the homemade ciabatta to the high quality porchetta to the plenty of pastry offerings, you can't go wrong! I definitely plan on bringing my parents here next time they visit Philly, and I'm already dreaming of the sandwich again.

Update: after my review a woman named Annette has been sending me messages and basically telling me that my review is not okay because she was there and frequents the bar and has not had a bad experience. Good for you Annette. I stand by my review.  To clarify: The waitress was unpleasant and snotty from the moment we walked in: When we first walked in, I asked if we should seat ourselves. I did not hear her response and when I clarified what she said, she got rude and short with me. Then I ordered and drink that they did not make and she scoffed at me, asked where I was from and then laughed in my face after I told her. I was taken back by such rude behavior but stayed because it was our first night in town and the location was convenient; we had not had time to explore the area yet.  Lastly she raised her voice at the guys in our group because they did not have their masks on at the pool table. One of them questioned why nobody else had theirs on, the waitress went and got the manger who then came out and told everyone that they had to have their masks on. This waitress was unprofessional, snotty, and the reason why we did not go back. This establishment missed out on a chunk of money because of one of their staff. The whole point of my review is to hopefully make them aware of the loss revenue so that they can make some changes. I don't think that I am asking too much to expect a server to be polite.

I had wanted to try out Terra Gaucha for a while, but taking young kids to a buffet is a no no in normal times and worse during a pandemic. However, getting take out or delivery is an easy way to have a very filling meal that is as high- or low-carb as you want. Everything was packed well, and servings were generous.

I got three different types of meat. They each came with two sides and also three pieces of cheese bread. I was unaware that they came with the cheese bread, so I ordered cheese bread and ended up with way too much cheese bread. Thankfully, they taste good cold, and my dog loves them.

We had the sausage, the picanha, and the bottom sirloin. I'd estimate each serving as about half a pound of meat. It was way too much meat for two adults and two kids, but those should all make for good leftovers. The sausage and the picanha were clear winners. I thought the sirloin was a little tough. The meats all bordered on being too salty, but I know that's how Brazillians barbecue, so fine.

For our sides, we had rice, beans, mashed potatoes, green beans, and french fries. Everything was fine, maybe on the bland side, but all are supposed to be the supporting cast to the meat.

I think Terra Gaucha makes for very reasonable take out. No, you don't get unlimited meat, but if you can narrow your choices down to 1-2 meat options per person, you'll get more food for your money that eating in person.",2021-01-12 13:57:35,320,1477,

The Hall of Champions is a well organized interactive museum located next to White River Park. Total disclosure, I went on a day that they were giving free admission. But, it is normally only $5 for adults and $3 for kids anyway, so it does not break the bank anyway and is well worth that.  

They validate parking to a discounted $5 if you park in the White River Park underground parking garage. The entire staff there is very helpful and friendly. The museum is very very clean and they have hand sanitizer all over the museum to try to keep the RONA down.

When you walk in, you are faced with a display of football linemen statues, with masks, looking right at you. The ground floor has an interactive display for all the major NCAA sports, Hall of Honor, and a small gift shop. There is also a replica of the NCAA trophy down there too.

The second floor has a mini-basketball court, but the rim is regulation, where you and your group can ""make it rain"". There is a sports simulator where you can pitch baseballs, or kick soccer balls past an alien goalie. There is also sprinter and swimmer starting blocks that you can get on.  My kids enjoyed seeing a 75 MPH ball coming flying at them. And by enjoyed, I mean scared their pants off.

Some notable exhibits in the museum include the impact of HBCUs, and contributions/impact of women athletes.

The place is not very big. I spent a little over an hour there, but it was still entertaining and impactful.  Surprisingly, my 1 and 5 year olds actually had a lot of fun. FYI, this museum is located by many other museums, as well as the zoo (all within walking distance) and could be part of a larger itinerary to maximize your day. I really enjoyed my visit and am glad that I came here.",2021-01-18 22:57:19,384,1826,

The day I called for the appointment, I told the receptionist, I had to be at work at noon so she scheduled me for 10:30am. (Me assuming that it won't take that long to get a consultation and I would still make it to work on time) I didn't do any reviews and just went with it because my insurance (VSP) was accepted there. 

When I got there, the lady at the front desk, handed me a bunch of papers, went over REALLY QUICKLY what it was and had me read and sign it. 

There were a bunch of papers with different types of exams and extra costs involved..which I didn't need. 

I tried to ask the lady to explain what each was and what I actually needed because all I want was a LASIK Consultation. Her answers were extremely confusing and didn't help me at all. 

She then asked if I wanted to be dilated, which I said no because I told her I needed to go to work at noon and needed to be able to see.

She then told me that I would have to pay for a test that wouldn't require my eyes to be dilated but that would be $39 and it's not covered by my insurance....I thought it was weird but I said sure. 

She also told me I needed to pay for another service that was $30....I said sure and signed the papers...a little uneasy with the whole experience, I decided to look them up on Yelp and I'm so glad I did! 

I saw all the negative reviews and ran right outta there!",2021-01-20 19:49:20,321,1427,

This takeout review includes:
Buffalo wings w/ Ranch
Duck Empanadas
Chicken Pesto Panini (no tomato)
Sweet Potato Fries 

I have been wanting to try this place for a while and they were really busy the last time I attempted to dine-in for brunch. 

On the dinner menu, there were so many items that caught my eye but I settled on the Chicken Pesto Panini (pictured) without the tomato.

The bread was perfectly crisp along the edges and right amount of moist in the center. Chicken hmmmm so juicy, and perfectly grilled. The pesto sauce was so savory and blended perfectly with the gooey cheese. It's honestly difficult to ruin a panini!

The panini comes with chips but I subbed them for sweet potato fries. They were thin cut and just about mushy by the time I got home but once I popped them in the oven for about 15mim the were pretty good.

Note: this business uses styrofoam to-go containers so anything you order that's grilled of fried may be mushy when you open the container. There was a good bit of condensation in my plate.

Everything about an empanada sounds good and I've never had them with duck. They were delicious! The flavor was spot on and the sweet chili sauce they were paired with was perfect.

The wings, one of my top 5, came wrapped in foil and literally maintained the hit from the point they hit that foil paper in the restaurant until they hit my kitchen counter. The Buffalo sauce had the perfect mix of tangy and spicy.
I didn't care for the breading but these wings were quite tender.

I will be returning to try a few more things on their menu, maybe brunch will be next!",2021-01-30 03:16:22,338,1666,

As if that isn't area is dope enough, the actual inside is even more popping. Just check out the bathroom you won't regret it! I think we tried every cocktail there, fabrika spritz being my favorite but they were all decent. For apps we had the octopus, the pork belly, the burrata and the bolognese. I wasn't crazy about the burrata, but the rest were outstanding. The pork belly melted in my mouth, you could taste the freshness of the homemade pasta. Although the bolognese is not a standard appetizer it is a must try!  I may have enjoyed the potatoes more than the octopus. For entrees we ""family styled"" it as usual. Lamb chops, shrimp risotto and flank steak. The lamb had great flavor, the mashed potatoes had flawless consistency and the risotto with the shrimp was just wow! The risotto with the shrimp was much better than the risotto that was served with the lamb chops.The steak itself was pretty good but not as good as the lamb chops. The menu has already changed since my visit a month ago and I believe they're open inside so I cannot wait to try again. The server even let us try some homemade peanut butter ice cream the pastry chef was experimenting with !!! I'm excited to go back, eat inside and see what lm sure will be fabulous show. This place will be a total vibe in the summer especially if they participate in sips! This was a closer to a 4.25 out of 5",2021-01-30 22:38:15,306,1466,

My first visit here was during Veteran's day when they had a nice discount for military vets so I really appreciated that gesture and had couple of beers and enjoyed the amazing rooftop bar view. 
I then decided to sample some of the food and got the duck confit grilled cheese sandwich which arrived cold and the duck was so full of gristle it was inedible then to add insult to injury I was given a paltry amount of fries with it.  My next visit was as a part of a Yelp Elite perk and this visit went much better and the bar seemed to be far better organized than during my first visit.  I told the manager about my last experience and he comped me another duck confit sandwich that was delicious and the complete opposite of the last one I had been served.  The only other thing that seems a bit off to me here is that they don't offer parking validation for customers of the bar which is standard practice at most of the other places like this in the area.

Overall the view alone is worth the cost of a visit here and that view does come with a premium on the price of the drinks here.  My food experience here would give me some caution but they did make up for the initial bad experience I had and the crab beignets were also very nice.  The portion size of the ""sharables"" section of their menu here I also would say are NOT sharable for the normal appetites of most men I know but maybe they would be for some ladies enjoying snacks and cocktails at this establishment.  I would emphasize ""snacks"" as I don't think most folks would make a full meal out of most of the ""sharables"" menu selections here.

This is a small mediterranean grocery with a deli, a limited selection of take out and prepared food and a few tables. This is all in a packed space of roughly 700-800 sq ft.

I was SO excited to try it in hope that I could get some authentic Greek-American food, some good feta (stored in water in many greek groceries), and maybe some Italian imports. 

I love ALL things Mediterranean, especially greek, between growing up with a lot of Greeks in Queens + a few visits to Greece, my authenticity meter is pretty on point. No Italian imports but recognized some greek ones and feta in water. I ordered 1 gyro pita (delish w/ fresh pita), 1 greek salad (w/ that goood feta), 1 spanakopita (YAS - authentic and even good room temp), and baklava (man, this was good too - walnuts and pastry were fresh w/ right amt. of honey).  

So, why 2 stars?  Let me tell you why.  

Because there is a sign on the door that says masks are required (SEE PIC) but NONE of the staff were wearing masks (1/3 had a face shield) and 7/9 patrons (assuming the 7 were regulars or perhaps some family because most were going in/out of back door).  There was no social distancing. There was even a greek orthodox priest that entered at the same time as me (wearing a bandana as a mask) but actually pulled it down over his chin after entering?!  Folks, including 2 elderly women were walking around, maskless, yapping across the store and one was coughing up a lung. I really thought I was on candid camera for a minute. 

I said I would wait outside given the lack of masks and when I went back in, 1 of the patrons + priest were wearing masks.  I picked up my food (quickly) and said how excited I was to try this place but was concerned that there was a sign on the door about masks that wasn't being followed.  The employee (face-shield) just sort of gave me a grunt and one of the elderly patrons, still maskless and now sitting, sort of heckled me, as I walked out and said she was eventually going to eat. 

Ultimately, if a business doesn't require masks, patrons can choose whether or not to visit that establishment, but when you mislead patrons, by putting a sign on the door saying that you require masks, and then do not follow or enforce it, that is not only negligent but deceiving.

Since then its been headaches and dissatisfaction over and over again , i really regret getting my car from here i wish i went up the street to larry h miller ; 

When i told someone about where i got my car they told me i better be ready for b*ll*it and headaches and he was ever so right ! 

Service department is just the worst there is no head on the donkey its just roaming wild ; ive gotten better customer service at the tanque verde swapmeet on a rainy day by a man who doesnt speak english . 

I told the ""service department manager"" that the only thing going smooth since we have purchased this VW is that the payments are being taken every month!! Ive had parts replaced , needed to be ordered , back ordered on a 2021 atlas . 

Some would like to say ' did i take covid into consideration'? But thats a pretty easy way out if you ask me . 

With all our problems and headaches we were given a one time car payment on VW which was just a slap in the face . If you read this please do not get a car from this dealership drive a few miles and go to the auto mall . 

I want to write more but itll just get nasty and vulgar .
