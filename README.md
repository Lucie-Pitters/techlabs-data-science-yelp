# techlabs-data-science-yelp
### Scope:
You are a startup aiming to create a "tool" that can analyze text-based patterns and categorize them into meaningful groups. (very highlevel, but its your tasks also to rethink it later on :zwinkern: )
### Your Responsibilities:
1. Evaluate Data Availability:
- Investigate the provided datasets: What formats are they in?
- Plan how to upload and manage these datasets in a GitHub repository.
- Determine how to connect the datasets effectively (hint: consider using a primary key to link data).
2. Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):
- Explore the datasets thoroughly, identify patterns, and understand the data structure.
- Use EDA methods to analyze and visualize key insights.
- Create a baseline model using the existing data.
3. Next Steps:
- Develop a Proof of Concept (POC).
4. Build the Minimum Viable Product (MVP):
- Your tool should analyze the comments section of the dataset and classify entries as positive, negative, and two additional categories that your team will define.
- Enhance your tool by incorporating additional datasets and refining its functionality and visualization.
- Plan how to present the final product with a clear vision of the end goal.
### Tech Stack:
- Python libraries recommendation: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, pytorch
- These are the minimum required tools. Feel free to explore additional libraries or APIs as needed.
